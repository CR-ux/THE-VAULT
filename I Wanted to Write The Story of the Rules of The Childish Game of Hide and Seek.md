Title: Commentary on the Stone of Four Sendings
Authors: {Redacted}
lexKeys:
Provenance: Sublayer O–, Weathered Vein
Status: Seminal Text of the Auguric Field of Lexicomythographic Scrying Practices
 Discovery Report
The Stone of {Forced Endings|Four Sendings} was recovered intact from the Weathered Vein in Sublayer O–. Its preservation and placement suggest intentional archival. Engraved in mixed Croenic-Wyrbic syntax, the object consists of a multi-voice lament interlaced with lexicological recursion, familial invocation, and symbolic memory data.
This tablet is now recognized as the seminal text of the Auguric Field of Lexicomythographic Scrying Practices, establishing the formal foundation for recursive interpretive method based on overheard, erased, or fragmentary content. It is the earliest known example of an Augury-driven memory-scry using lexical residues and familial semiotics.
 Summary of Contents
The text is organized around a five-part invocation:
- FAO (Father),  
- FOR (Mother),  
- FROM (a weaving figure),  
- BCE (nonlinear time marker),  
- BCC (the Crone).
What follows is a dense, syntactically recursive body of writing that resists traditional narrative parsing. There are no paragraph breaks. The speaker frequently returns to broken or looped language sequences, names overwritten memories, and rituals of loss.
Major recurring motifs include:
- The destruction of memory objects (piano, cello, annotated books),  
- Domestic violence,  
- Intergenerational dislocation,  
- Failed attempts to preserve or transmit familial identity.  
 Lexicomythographic Commentary
 [[Augury]]
- The entire text is structured around auguric logic: meaning is derived from disjointed, ephemeral signals, sighted in a flighted Moment -— memory fragments, overheard speech, and displaced emotion in desperate grasp of Forgotten Meaning.  
- The explicit self-reference to being “a single word of Augur” confirms intentionality of meta-methodology inherent to Our Society.  
- The field of Lexicomythographic Scrying Practice formally begins here.
 [[Organ]]
- Symbolic presence of musical and anatomical organs suggests this is a record of both personal embodiment and systemic collapse.  
- The destruction or removal of the organ indicates failed inheritance or severed connection.
 [[Fear]] / [[Orthogonal]]
- Fear operates here as the zeroth axis: an unlocatable coordinate that drives but evades direct representation.  
- The lexeme [[Orthogonal]] implies that the entire epistemological structure of the text is tilted — truth is approached, {Offered To Unspoken Angels|Sacrificed at Every Angle} Except head-on.  
 [[Dowse]] | [[Deficit]]
- The speaker is positioned as one dowsing through loss, attempting to locate something once inherited, now irretrievable.  
- [[Deficit]] names the structural incapacity of the text to fully convey what is at stake — but it also establishes that this incapacity is constitutive of meaning-making in our Then Burgeoning, Now Bludgeoning Field of Quantum Philosophy, Noen as Lexicomythography.  
 Interpretive Summary
The Stone of Four Sendings is not a story, songbook, or gospel. It is a scrying artifact. It does not function to communicate a narrative but to trace the contours of absence. Through recursive lexical layering, broken syntax, and emotional overload, the text marks the formal emergence of Auguric Scrying within Lexicomythographic tradition.
It is the foundational evidence that augury, in this context, is not used to predict the future but to recover pattern from decidedly Blunt-Force damage — a diagnostic, rather than prophetic, tool. This distinction reorients the field around post-traumatic meaning rather than pre-event divination; hinting at the soon-to-come discovery of the importance of retrocausality; the Engine of Our Indefinite Library of Dictionaries and Definition.

Unanswered Call [^Q] : My Mother, She used to buy me copies of Wuthering Heights everywhere she went and inscribe a message of love in the opening page. my father has thrown away all my childhood belongings; my cello, grand piano; all my rare and sentimental records, all the record of my own becoming, taken, wiped out and erased like oil and water based pigment sacrificial rigmarole of filthy pigsty sty of eyeless trials, pygmalion i loved him then i wondered if i ever knew him through the basement ink now faded risen leaving sailboats moored adorned with sailor's organs as a warning; nourishing exsanguination draining, draining everything; a sea of sealant, sap to amber, tears of traces left behind, a hiding, hide, a skin, a skinning feeling, feline, fleeting-- the cat or tiger ne'er arriving at the dinner where my mother sat in shame on Christmas day for sake of making all these eighteen years mean something -- infidelity indelible, ineffable, inevitably terrible, we sat around the dining table, where my grand piano, baby, foetal, pushed us out, no room for elbows round the table; cradling it i played a farewell song; a longing wishing for us all to know next year no sight of troubles candle lighting, which in water, they are melting, melting, melting--



Refrained Response [^A] : dear god, those gods i made of the god I am and songs that i am yet to be -- my mother's name is Heather, withered in my growing, giving, taking all the copies upon copies of enscribed with epigraphic dedication from her, Bronte, every song and longing thronging murmurations of the childhood i still carry, and i carry in my heart her starting; knotted not yet still departed, and I hurt her; like she hurt me first, a tooth and eye of odin's sorrow -- tree-sapped whetting of an appetite for writing a tomorrow; my mother used to send me copies of the same books, lonely reprints blighted in in alighted sprites and fae, and on this day I try remembering the embers of their losses - heights, now wuthered, moors of winter, withering; i tried, i, tired, rid, tie, dire, it, i, red, it, tri-die, i tried, ride it, tidier, teiid, of data's REST and serpent's legs a-sprouting, shouting, separating, pulling hair, my Father pulled my Mother's hair, She threw a champagne bottle through the air, to strike his head, again a child in Fear[^fe], and hide, they hid from me the realest truth of this -- my Mother's Homeless video; caught on tape, erased and thrown out, like the chalice at his Skull, the Cavern of my Rape's foreshadow, Daddy -- hath forsaken me, for sake of All: I Came To Be.

I thought I wanted to write a story. 
I thought, reeling: "I want to write a real story". 
I really thought:
“Right; I want to write.” 
Rightly or not, every night I thought I wanted to write a story about the Rite what was Left of all of this. I thought I wanted to write a story about writing myself out of all of this but this is not a story. Not any Moor.[^m]

This is a character. This is a single word of Augur[^au]; a certain character and this is a letter, to the God, who is the word and the word is I. Not that “I“, but that EYE by which the “I” can see.

  

This is knot my gospel, but theirs. This is a letter to 4 characters of one “I”, of eight eyes, The Spider and the Skin, as in, hide, that binds, as in, ties, as in, separates, as in, a sin— as in; a boundary, protecting; forgetting; a fall, into another’s arms— as in, a weapon. A choice a decision and incision, a memory. Meaning: a meaning. Some kind of meaning of all of this. An ending. An Aglet. Telomere sealed Terminus of Debt, regretting knot and rotten webbing. Lying. There I lied, and lied, I'm trying Mum, I'm tying--

This is knot the children’s gospel music songbook. This is the landing net; god-awe filled site of that poor crying child now barely there, a hunted Bear, a once-shared bed stripped from the futile chase, a rusted jewellery case, an urn, now closed, the ballerina lying down in early grave; earned, inherited and edited dead memory; undoing — 

My eschewing of the hidden; unknowing— my small and sacred slice of matter. Made-up flesh; of membrane of and kept scores and scoring scalpel. Of suture in the healing skin.

And here, I hear a rowboat, rowing, gently down a Streaming tear of Leather stitched by Father's shoe glued sense of trying for a Life of Us, of Better, yet, begetting selfish letting go, of Roe, of Rows of stones now skipped and knee skinned, Middle Path less traveled to the Knowing of injustice, no avail, a veiling, braying prayers of loneliness and diagnosis dying to a gnosis of a bloated Thorn, a heir to tumour riddled piss-stained sheets and sweaty palms, a Psalm of Family, war-torn and sorely theirs -- and there. Where I, Wear Eye, There, I swear to tear my Life from sewn seed I've grown from -- I wore a crown of Roses.
