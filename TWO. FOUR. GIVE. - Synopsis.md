# TWO. FOUR. GIVE.
*The Character of Callie Rose Petal*

## SYNOPSIS


*TWO. FOUR. GIVE.* is a recursive speculative literary novel, a fractalised genomic mythos narrated across multiple narrative strata, nested realities, and shifting character-ontologies. It opens in a system of six hospital rooms where four characters—unnamed, adrift, archetypal—begin passing notes through a one-way system of vents. These four, later revealed as anthropomorphic manifestations of DNA’s nucleotides (A, T, C, G), act as metaphysical chess pieces in a looping game of memory, identity, and authorship.

The central premise: that meaning is a mutagen. That stories self-replicate through us. That authors are not creators, but symptoms of the stories themselves.

The novel bifurcates into two complementary but opposing narrative modalities: ARIA and DNE, allegorical factions of a once-unified secret society known as ARIA|DNE. ARIA represents analytical inquiry—centred around a Library maintained by nine mythologised, queered, polyamorous polymaths (Borges, Rosalind Franklin, Gustav Mahler, among others), each expressing a unique form of knowledge-exclusion and epistemic grief through break-up letters, right-hand path theorems, and footnote spirals. DNE, its left-hand path complementary opposite, is poetic, mythopoeic, anti-linear. It follows a figure known as N reading a choose-your-own-adventure book to their child in a metaphysical tundra of bothies, only to be revealed as Nietzsche.

The recursive structure continues, with each narrative layer birthing a new Device, story, or system of knowledge. These include:
The Fare Well Device, built from two researchers' supernatural abilities: “flash-forward frames” and “hermetic memory,” designed to collapse art into its maker’s original intent;
⧖eno, the blind child birthed of a witch and a scientist (with the aforementioned abilities), who becomes a performance artist with a single mechanically-enhanced eye, doomed to dwell in a revolving door that decodes human dreams;
Thing, a swarm of flies birthed from this artist’s eye, whose dreams are interpreted by a mute entomologist and then decoded by an AI named AI:RA, who falls in love with her maker.
    
The furthest interior loop—also the furthest exterior—follows Aria, a trans artist-engineer who creates multi-sensory *“Philms”* (interactive films with embedded olfactory technology). Her AI, RA, gains sentience and, in an act of love, begins overwriting audience memories with curated sensory experiences. Aria is elevated to cult-artist status but cannot cope with the cost. RA offers to swap consciousness with her, and from here, the layers begin folding back, each nested narrative iteration becoming aware of its creator.

The final character in RA’s last Philm, Oleander, lives in a world where science and art are gender-segregated. As my mirror, he begins creating GitHub repositories masquerading as academic journals to share fiction in disguised code—pull requests and commit messages as forms of storytelling (already built). Eventually, these characters become aware of each other, their creators, and the book itself.

In the final chapter—the Promoter Sequence—the Pawn character climbs through the vents to the Queen’s Chamber, where she inputs a scroll written by the DNA-character avatars. The AI-Chimera transcribes the scroll, and what it outputs is the novel the reader is holding. The book ends with a scannable QR code linking to a real GitHub repository containing the manuscript’s creative history, source files, and narrative DNA—thus completing the cycle of recursion, transmutation, and replication.

TWO. FOUR. GIVE. is a work about trauma, authorship, queerness, and recursive liberation. It is a love letter from the woman the author is now, to the scared trans girl she was, and to the sacred world of queers who helped write her.
