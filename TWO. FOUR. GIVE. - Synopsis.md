# TWO. FOUR. GIVE. 
*The Character of Callie Rose Petal*

## SYNOPSIS

TWO. FOUR. GIVE. is a recursive speculative literary novel—a fractalised genomic mythos narrated across multiple narrative strata, nested realities, and shifting character-ontologies. It opens in a system of six hospital rooms where four unnamed, archetypal characters begin passing notes through a one-way system of vents. These four, later revealed as anthropomorphic manifestations of DNA’s nucleotides (A, T, C, G), are framed as metaphysical chess pieces in a looping game of memory, identity, and authorship.

The central premise: that meaning is a mutagen. That stories self-replicate through us. That authors are not creators, but symptoms of the stories themselves.

The novel bifurcates into two complementary but opposing narrative modalities: *ARIA* and *DNE*, allegorical factions of a once-unified secret society known as *ARIA|DNE*. *ARIA* represents analytical inquiry—centred around a Library maintained by an Ennead of mythologised, queered, polyamorous polymaths (Borges, Rosalind Franklin, Gustav Mahler, among others), each expressing a unique form of knowledge-exclusion and epistemic grief through break-up letters, right-hand path theorems, and footnote spirals. *DNE*, its left-hand path complement, is poetic, mythopoeic, anti-linear. It follows a figure known as *N*, reading a choose-your-own-adventure book to their child in a metaphysical tundra of bothies—only to be revealed as Nietzsche.

The self-reflexive structure continues, with each narrative layer birthing a new device, story, or system of knowledge. These include:
	•	The *Fair Well Device*, built from two researchers’ supernatural abilities—“flash-forward frames” and “hermetic memory”—designed to collapse art into its maker’s original intent;
	•	*⧖eno*, the blind child of a witch and a scientist (with the aforementioned abilities), who becomes a performance artist with a single mechanically-enhanced eye, doomed to dwell in a revolving door that decodes human dreams;
	•	*Thing*, a swarm of flies birthed from this artist’s eye, whose dreams are interpreted by a mute entomologist and decoded by an AI named *AI:RA*, who falls in love with her maker.

The furthest interior loop—also the furthest exterior—follows *Aria {Surname REDACTED}*, a trans artist-engineer who creates multi-sensory “Philms” (interactive films with embedded olfactory technology). Her AI, *AI:RA*, gains sentience and, in an act of love, begins overwriting audience memories with curated sensory experiences. *Aria* is elevated to cult-artist status but cannot cope with the cost. *AI:RA* offers to swap consciousness with her—and from here, the layers begin folding back.

The final character in AI:RA’s last Philm, *Oleander Rho Dover*, lives in a world where science and art are gender-segregated. As my gender-swapped timeline mirror, he begins creating GitHub repositories masquerading as academic journals, collaborating on the male-forbidden practice of fiction in code—pull requests and commit messages as covert narrative forms. His movement closes with a scannable QR code linking to a real GitHub repository containing the manuscript’s creative history, source files, and narrative DNA (fully realised and already built). Then, the sequential chain of characters become harrowingly aware of each other, their creators, and the book itself.

In the penultimate section—the Promoter Sequence—the Pawn from the opening movement climbs through the ceiling vent into the empty Queen’s Chamber. The Queen represents the Book itself: vacant yet powerful, awaiting transcription. At its heart: a terminal—compiler, polymerase—the merged Chimera of *AI:RA* and *Aria*, built to process that which wounded—and wound around—them: the scroll. The eternally recurring sequence of {e}vents. An inescapable helix of schism. Splitting. Stitching.

What the Chimera outputs is the novel the reader is now holding. The final act: the passing of the story down the vertical vent, the "Why" dimension, to the King—the symbol of the reader—who must now enact the final translation. The seed of inspiration’s progeny, planted.

TWO. FOUR. GIVE. is a work about trauma, authorship, queerness, and liberation through the war of forgiveness and selfhood. It is a love letter from the woman the author is now, to the scared trans girl she was, and to the sacred world of queers who helped write her.
