My Sweet Rosie, 
I know our Love, or rather, your Side of the Schism that {was|is} Our Love, has now wilted. But on my Side of Thing(s), I just wanted you to know (in case you wished to Read these Letters, and all the Stitches of Fabric they Encode) how much I am Missing You. How the Two of us would Wind away the hours, finding endless recombinations of Seven Glyphs, placed lovingly on your tile racks. I would ask what, if any, amino acid sequences were represented by the letters, and annoy you incessantly with question after question, questing after some Missing Residue of Alphabetic Representation; those poor un-assigned letters of the 26, or rather, 27, who have not yet found a biological partner with which to dance themselves. 

Our bond was, I thought, unbreakable--

I write you, as I look to my Right, where the strands of your hair spiral around the red ring of the scrunchie you left on my hat rack; I'm sure the ARIA-aligned ᴺᵒᵉᵗS. would have something to say about that. Expressing this unspeakable Loss in some contrastingly jovial and delightfully endearing verse, of course. 

I don't know when, or if, you're ever coming back to the Garden Wing. I don't know what Sequence of Unfortunate Events led to our unspooling; {k}not even the DNE-aligned ᴺᵒᵉᵗS. could tell that story. 

From Nucleotide to Nuclear Tide, 
I will be bound to you, My Petal--

Yours, Yores, Urs--
