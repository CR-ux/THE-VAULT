[^glam]: *"I want to confess it all to you; and I want you to agree with me, then absolve us both. we live above the trees but at night i still watch their shadows flicker into our bedroom, that warm orange light filtering up from the street lamps below. the local news reports mysterious lights in the sky, dancing together “like a string of pearls”, and I think, thank god; the aliens are here and they’re exceedingly glamorous"*- A, For Adrian.
