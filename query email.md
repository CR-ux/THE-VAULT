I hope this email finds you well—or at least the right kind of unwell for what follows.


I’m submitting the synopsis and opening ten pages of my 99,666-word speculative literary transnovel, **_TWO. FOUR. GIVE._**, for your consideration. While this book is formally performative and deliberately unconventional, I believe it resonates with your interest in inventive work reframing the reading experience.


This novel has been developed with a performative print and digital structure in mind—forked-path footnote gardens, conceptual poetic mechanisms, and embedded hyperstructure. It’s a story you _walk through_ as much as read. The digital manuscript includes hyperlinked footnotes and a recursive design that mirrors the self-replicating genome at its thematic core. The reader becomes archivist, architect, and replication machinery—like a choose-your-own-adventure with no escape.


I’d be honoured to send the full manuscript and its scripted PDF twin, designed to echo the book’s recursive performance structure.


Thank you so much for your time and consideration.


Sincerely,

**Callie Rose Petal**
