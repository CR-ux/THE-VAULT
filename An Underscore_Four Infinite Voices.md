 The Two, plus Four, 
 that Give.

 In Bellows Blood
 The Organs of
 The Violence In
 The Characters, 
 The Garden's Wings
 Left Splayed,
 The Bird, 
 Spine Open 
 as an Ovum
 A Window,
 As in Pain
 In Vain, 
 In Closing Pulse;
 The Augur

 
 of This Story, 
 Who wrote me
 into Being 
 A Character made
 Of Stories
 Who wrote a 
 Letter 
 To an unforgiving God 
 Who She thought had forgot her.
 
 In His Story 
 In HIS sWords
 its characters 
 therein
 
 They're In
 Her plot 
 that thinned,
 and pinned
 it churned
 made furniture 
of wicker


 injustice 
 must be 
 dust swept in
 as in
 a sickness 
licked her 
 
 Just sliming myth
 Just crime, gone missed
 pissed sheets
 designed 
 like paper 
 
  containing what
  became
 Just fiction
 characters
 Forgiven-
 
 Giving in 
 The Word, the Host
 The Paint on Walls 
 Scraped thin
 Left Bleeding
 Raped
 And Taking
 Over,
 Written 
 Under,
 through-
 Tape 
 Reæling
 
 
 A Saturate
 A Fattening
 Of Re-recorded 
 Meaning 
 
 Breathing
 
 In
 
 A life
 In Memory,
 Now; Forgotten
 Facing Death
 In Rotten Leaves
 Burnt Page,
 Sages, Smoke, Still, Blowing
 Moats Oar, Water, 
 Trodden. 
 
 Reflecting, 
 As infection 
 As
 in Two,
 As Sin
 As
 Schism
 
 Then Alone, 
 All One, 
 As Nothing
 Torn Skin
 Spat on
 
 Sodden.
 
 The Filth, 
 that quells
 Who pleads in weight;
 I'm swollen, 
 See 
 an 
 Ocean
 
 
 
 Fertilising 
 All Disease 
 In Furnace 
 of its
 
 
 Breathing
 
 
 Sporing Out
 Exiled 
 Defiled 
 A Holding of This-
 Pollen 
 
 And Falling Light,
 Into A
 Well-
 A Paleness 
 Of Regretting
 
 A Page That Let Go 
 Of its Ink
 Its Scales,
 Its staves,
 Its netting;
 
 In Blood, 
 Emptiness, 
 As in 
 Asking--
 
 That Which 
 Revolves, 
 Begets 
 What Is 
 A Letter 
 To
 The Author,
 
 if: {
 That 
 You Are 
 It Writes
 The Script
 }
  Then,
 	 Be{comes, | {Came|{F{all|ollow}s} Fo{u}rth}
 		 {for|Four|Fore}
 			  else if More: {
 
 As in, Is
 
 {Yours, Or—
	 Yore’s Ore—
		 Your Oar For—
			For Giving All; Your Story.
			}
		}
	}
.
