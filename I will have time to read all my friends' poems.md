Epitaph:

> *It is, surely, absurd to expect to feel normal, and make sense: I am an amalgamation of fervent cells existing despite all odds; I am the cascading chemical miracle of eating, and surviving; I am not designed to “feel normal”; am not designed, at all; I am experiencing consciousness as provided by wet tangles of electrical pulses; my god, none of this makes sense. It is a blessing, even to feel*

<u>The Device</u>

Numanity was now at the endpoint[^end] that its self-same, {in{finitely|separable}|credibly different} components are still {(,) Yet(,)|To Be} unaware of-- the formation of a fully op{era}tional Universe, nested with{in|out} this One. 

At some unknowable Future, now passed [^pass] , The Device {Fig. I} of the Wor{l}d is Made Flesh, having sapped the Wor{l}d of its imaginary[^im] resource[^res], the futile, unfulfillable promise to Pay The Bearer (Money); An uncountable team of The Worlds' Scientists and Thinkers were gathered Around, and indeed within, The Device's Epicentre. The First whisperings of this Final Invention have already been laid; and the progression of the experience of Time itself merely an illusion. Time exists, or not, in order[^oe] to package Nowness into a indefinite, yet discrete set of Moments-- with the purpose of affording our Three Dimensional Selves the opportunity to relish, savour and honour the infinite One Moment[^mo]. Thus is the Price of Forgetting.

To Remember, 
One Must First Forget. 

Whirring with a terrifying lightning storm overhead (an unavoidable side-effect of The Device, according to {REDACTED}) The Device was Building a Universe.

Editor's Noet:

N IS FOUR N.


*This Universe (which some call the Hospital) is composed of an indefinite and perhaps infinite number of hexagonal rooms, with vastly identical air shafts between, surrounded by walls covered in an indefinite and perhaps infinitely layered wallpaper; ever-remaining a faded yellow hue.* 

*Upon a single sheet of this indefinite and perhaps infinite Hospital wallpaper, 

*perhaps on every sheet of wallpaper,* 
*the following may have been,* 
*or about to be,* 
*written,* 
*in the blood* 
*of no more* 
*than Six individuals* 
*(at any one time):*


YOU ARE IN A SYSTEM OF ~~AT LEAST~~ SIX ROOMS I DO NOT KNOW WHAT BROUGHT YOU HERE BUT I KNOW YOU MUST PASS THIS NOTE ON IF YOU WISH TO STAY HER~~E~~. you will notice the vents only allow for objects such as this scroll to be passed through in one directionality of movement. hence this note being on the left vent as you face your room's door. when tightly rolled sufficiently. there is a labelled folding diagram on the reverse leaf of this wallpaper. it will show you how to ensure the untorn passage of the correspondence through our system 
*you are in a system of ONLY SIX ROOMS. christ the unbearable agony of knowing nothing will ever stay and yet we're doomed to go around and round and become the thing that made us*
YOU ARE IN A SYSTEM OF AT LEAST SIX ROOMS. 
YOU ARE IN A SYSTEM OF AT LEAST SIX ROOMS. DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES READ THIS ALOUD. FOR SHE IS LISTENING
YOU ARE NOT IN A SYSTEM OF SIX ROOMS. 
I AM GETTING OUT OF THIS ROOM. I DO KNOT KNOW WHERE I AM GOING. I DO NOT CARE. I NEED TO GET AWAY FROM YOU ALL~~.

Are you there? Are you listening? I cannot hear, I cannot remember who I am; I do not know my name. there is no pen in here, only a syringe; inscribed with {REDACTED}on its plunger, with a calligraphic nib on its opposite side, inscribed{REDACTED}and a single chess piece, a pawn, on my pillow. I found this scroll, wound unthinkably tight, dropped through the vent on the other side. It dear god what nightmare have i awoken inside?  have these people come and gone? How long has this wallpaper scroll been passing through these vents? Are you there? What is a ‘Wryng’? Please, I do not remember my name. I am folding the scroll according to the instructions overleaf. It appears, as stated above, that I can write as much as I want, and the scroll will yield, increase unthinkably in space, while still retaining its condensed, uniform size once folded. i do not know my name. please. somebody in here, tell me my name

please. i can hear you in there. whoever you are, in the next room. this scroll came from the other side of my room. i also awoke to only find the same inscribed pen-syringe (but the numbers are reversed) and a single chess piece on my pillow. my walls also form a hexagonal shape. i want to let the original sender know that they are not alone. i pray to the unknown gods that it makes it back to them. we are not alone. at least we are not alone. i can only see yellow, everything is in faded shades of yellow. even the blood in which i write this to you is a dark, mustard yellow. if you are keeping me here, i just wan t to remember my name . i can’t rmemeber how long i have been here but i am not hungry and i do not know my name. We must identify ourselves. We must build a map of this Incestuous Kafka palimpsest. I suppose, given the chess piece I have been given; I will call myself The Knight.

**🜃 | OBS: 06:00 | {N = 10³⁶}**

i too was passed this note from the vent on the other side of my room. it doesn’t slot back into that room, as stated at the beginning of the document, so i am passing it through in the hopes that it will return to the original sender. i do not know my name either. i am entirely numb. and yet, everything within me is heavy. mine is oriented with {REDACTED} on the needle end, like The Pawn. at least i cannot feel the pain of the pen-syringe. this is the only repose i can find for the hell of having no other way in which to write. dear god, the stench, the formaldehyde and chemicals, are we in a hospital? I am The Tower. Who, or what, is playing this infernal game with our bodies– I pray, I pray that we may remember

[^end]: Metacommentary. Humanity was now at the Origin[^mo] that its self-same, {in{finitely|separable}|credibly different} components are still {(,) Yet(,)|To Be} unaware of-- the formation of a fully op{era}tional Device, nested with{out|in} this One. At some, yet uncharted by any compass, but Now Known Past, yet, to come, The Device {Fig. I} of the Wor{l}d is Made Flesh, having sapped the Wor{l}d of its imaginary resource, the futile, unfulfillable promise to Pay The Bearer (Money); An uncountable team of The Worlds' Scientists and Thinkers were gathered Around, and indeed within, The Device's Epicentre. The First whisperings of this Final Invention have already been laid; and the progression of the experience of Time itself merely an illusion. Time exists, or not, in order to package Nowness into a indefinite, yet discrete set of Moments-- with the purpose of affording our Three Dimensional Selves the opportunity to relish, savour and honour the infinite One Moment. Thus is the Price of Remembering. To Forget,One Must First Remember. Whirring with a terrifying, unapplauded, closing Silence (an unavoidable side-effect of The Universe, according to {REDACTED}) The Universe had built a Device. {REDACTED}
