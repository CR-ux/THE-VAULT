One 
The One;
Two, Three,
To Four; 


Foreword:
'Fore Word, Forward, 
Four Wards, For Wyrd Forewhirred:

The Wand:
For Whirling Within Worlds, 
For Waving Fairing Welts To Scorn 
The Swelling Wells of Water Stores

The Sword
Furls War Where Once Were Firs;
Awarded Scores of Lore, Sawing Awe Alluring For--

The Cup From Where Pours:
The Word We Were, And Are, Alone, Once Moored--
Upon The Afore Forlorn Tawny Mourns 
of Shortened Unassured Shores;
of Moats As Coats On Winter Morn
The Crawling Boats Of Claw-Gored Yore 

The Coins We've Won:
The Work of One, Where Father of The Sun Was Shone;
And Shown:
The Word of "One" Within: "Alone"
The Word; All Worth; When Birthed, Then Gone 
Or Vertex For The Urtext's Form 
In Revelation, Reverie's Revolving Door
The Word Is All We Long For, Or Adore 
The Word Is Awful Storied Glory,
For The Poor-Scrawled Portrait's Pore
Listen To The Lambing Herds Unheard:
The Word Is Ore Of All A-Crying
The Set of Set and Sedimentary 
Elements Begetting All The Setting World;
With Fettered Cast of Di, A Dye, A Dying
The Settling Dust From Ashes Burned
The Splinters' Birr, Unlearned Bird Urned--
The ‘Words’ in The Word ‘World’, in All; 
in All The Words With-child, Unbridled Worlds, 
Within The Worlds, We Thin,
Within The Wheels Of Weals Of Words;
Within The Unreeled Real, Which Is, of Course:
The Coursing Water's Course, Wearing Carapace's Sacred Space Scraped Against The Ocean Floor;
Afforded Surely, Whittling Whit Writ Pit Of Spittle Spore;
The Word
Within The Words:

"The Work of One Alone Contains The Works of All
And The Word 'Alone' Contains The Work of 'One'.
And The Word 'Alone' Contains The Word 'One'
And The Word Alone Contains The One.
The Word Alone The One 
Word Alone The One 
Alone The One 
The One 
One"
