Humanity was now at the endpoint that its self-same, {in{finitely|separable}|credibly different} components are still unaware of-- the formation of a fully operational Universe, nested with this One. 

At some unknowable Future, now passed[^pass], The Device {Fig. I} of the Word is Made Flesh, having sapped the World of its imaginary[^im] resource[^res], the futile, unfulfillable promise to Pay The Bearer (Money); An uncountable team of The Worlds' Scientists and Thinkers were gathered Around, and indeed within, The Device's Epicentre. The First whisperings of this Final Invention have already been laid; and the progression of the experience of Time itself merely an illusion. Time exists, or not, in order[^oe] to package Nowness into a indefinite, yet discrete set of Moments-- with the purpose of affording our Three Dimensional Selves the opportunity to relish, savour and honour the infinite One Moment. Thus is the Price of Forgetting.

To Remember, 
One Must First Forget. 

Whirring with a terrifying lightning storm overhead (an unavoidable side-effect of the Device, according to NASA) The Device was Building a Universe.

[^res]: Money Will become pointless once knowledge has reached an amalgamative crescendo. In the current timeline, the Future implications of Humanity's technological advancement are to render the delineation, borrowing, movement of 'Money' (from Residue to 'revenue' to residue) irrelevant, by virtue of the obvious and global importance of the 'Expensive' Discovery at Hand.
