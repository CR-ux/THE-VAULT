**Callie Rose Petal** (born 17 April 1994) is a Scottish [avant-garde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avant-garde "Avant-garde") [conceptual performance artist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_artist "Conceptual artist"), [composer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composer "Composer"), [software developer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_developer "Software developer"), and language artist.[1] Her work spans [experimental literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_literature "Experimental literature"), [noise composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_music "Noise music"), and [transmedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmedia_storytelling "Transmedia storytelling") ritual.[2] She is known for her work as a "noise alchemist"[3] , fusing [experimental sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_sound "Experimental sound"), [ritual structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritual "Ritual"), and [semiotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotics "Semiotics").[4]

**Early life and creative development**

Petal demonstrated academic aptitude from an early age but experienced delayed diagnosis of [ADHD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder") and [autism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism "Autism"), a manifestation of [twice-exceptionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twice_exceptional "Twice exceptional").[3] Her initial creative output was [poetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetry "Poetry"),[5] later expanding into [music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music "Music") and [visual art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_arts "Visual arts"), particularly through her album cover designs.[6] Her background in [bioinformatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics "Bioinformatics") and [scientific research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_research "Scientific research") into [virology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology "Virology")[7] eventually integrated into her [interdisciplinary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity "Interdisciplinarity") [transtextual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transtextuality "Transtextuality")narrative framework, _Lexicomythography_[8], which leverages these diverse specialisms into a research methodology for characters within her [multiverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_universe "Fictional universe").[9]

Her creative practice initially served as a shield against the difficulties of growing up [trans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender "Transgender") in the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom "United Kingdom"),[10][11] later evolving from a protective outlet to an expressive tool — shifting from insular, [contemplative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemplation "Contemplation") solitary work to anger-infused "performance-as-purge"[12], and ultimately reaching a balance through [integration of these opposites.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemical_marriage "Alchemical marriage")[3]

Petal also hosts and curates the radio show “the medium is the wreckage” on [EHFM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EHFM "EHFM")[13], where she "explores the many forms that abrasion takes"; showcasing original noise works, abrasive soundscapes, [spoken word poetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoken_word "Spoken word") fragments and her writings and personal reflections, which [merge fiction and nonfiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autofiction "Autofiction") — a [literary method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_method "Literary method") reminiscent of [Borges'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Luis_Borges "Jorge Luis Borges") work.[14]

**Career**

Petal’s practice involves the design of [fictional languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_language "Fictional language"), hybrid systems blending [constructed linguistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language "Constructed language") elements[15] with [esoteric programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language "Esoteric programming language") features[16], used and/or written by characters and entities within her narrative universe, along with the [compilation of conceptual dictionaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicography "Lexicography").[17] She interlaces [programming logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_in_computer_science "Logic in computer science") with [mythopoetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythopoeia "Mythopoeia") frameworks to create complex [symbolic meanings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language "Formal language"). She was a [Creative Informatics](https://creativeinformatics.org/) Resident Entrepreneur[18] in Edinburgh, exploring [transmedia narrative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmedia_storytelling "Transmedia storytelling") [platforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_platform_\(infrastructure\) "Digital platform (infrastructure)") integrating audio, [computational statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_statistics "Computational statistics"), and digital storytelling.

She holds a published academic background in virology and [bioinformatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics "Bioinformatics"), contributing notably to research on [avian influenza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza "Avian influenza") during her time as a Researcher at [The Roslin Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roslin_Institute "Roslin Institute").[7] While at Roslin, she received the Outstanding Student Experience Award for her [extracurricular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracurricular_activity "Extracurricular activity") work, introducing [inclusive bathrooms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unisex_public_toilet "Unisex public toilet") on all floors of the Institute and organising its first [queer/ally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_ally "Straight ally") social events.[19] Petal has stated that this scientific foundation underpins her creative work, drawing influence from intersecting [biological and computational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_biology "Computational biology") methodologies.[9][11]

She [composed the score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Score_composer "Score composer") and starred in the [short documentary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_documentary_film "Short documentary film") ‘‘What It Means to Be’’[20] by [Lea Luiz de Oliveira](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm9878780/?ref_=tt_ov_dr_1), which won [Best Short Documentary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_award "Film award") at the [KASHISH Pride Film Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KASHISH_Pride_Film_Festival "KASHISH Pride Film Festival").[21] The film follows three years of Petal’s life as an [artist-activist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artivism "Artivism") navigating [medical transition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_transition "Medical transition") and [chronic illness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_illness "Chronic illness"). It was screened in [Edinburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh "Edinburgh")[22], [Glasgow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow "Glasgow")[11], and [Brussels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels "Brussels")[23], where Petal also featured in post-screening live Q&As.

As a [performance artist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_artist "Performance artist"), she was commissioned by the international queer art showcase [Homografía Festival](https://homografia.com/) in Brussels, presenting hybrid works of live performance, noise composition, and ritual. Her commissioned performance work at Homografía 2023, ‘‘IF ONLY HANDS COULD SPEAK’’[2], was a multidisciplinary ritual, drawing from the [myth of Philomela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philomela "Philomela") as [catharsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catharsis "Catharsis") for her own experience of [sexual trauma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse "Sexual abuse").[2] The piece involved "staged [self-mutilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-mutilation "Self-mutilation") with [theatrical blood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatrical_blood "Theatrical blood"), a [prosthetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis "Prosthesis") tongue, [live painting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_painting "Live painting"), and ended with [aggressive extended vocal technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screaming_\(music\) "Screaming (music)") in an open, industrial venue, addressing themes of forced vulnerability and biological essentialism imposed on trans women".[4] The performance piece was first premiered in a [gallery installation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_installation "Art installation") in Edinburgh at [LTD Ink Corporation](https://ltdinkcorporation.com/).[24] Petal delivered a hybrid live art performance with electric double bass and keyboards, mixing field recordings, noise and queer industrial music at Edinburgh's Sneaky Pete's[25], a venue which won the Music Week Award for Best Small Venue in 2019,[26] and has been shortlisted for Best Venue in the UK and Europe as part of BBC Radio 1 Dance Awards, 2025.[27]

Her 2020 [one-woman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-woman_show "One-woman show") [durational performance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endurance_art "Endurance art") ‘‘HOW MUCH DO I HAVE TO BLEED’’[4], explored embodied exhaustion, [censorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship "Censorship"), and audience proximity, performed bound and gagged, drenched in blood, and marked with the names of [trans people killed in acts of violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence_against_transgender_people "Violence against transgender people") that year, an act of [endurance art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endurance_art "Endurance art") amplifying themes of silenced grief and bodily vulnerability during the COVID-19 pandemic.[4] The piece was documented and accompanied by her 2020 orchestral release, _GAUDIA,_ in _What It Means to Be._[20]

She is also a software developer, incorporating technical expertise into [interactive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_art "Interactive art"), [narrative-driven systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative_art "Narrative art") and [digital artworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_art "Digital art").[28]

Petal releases music under the moniker [ⁿᵒᵗBorges](https://notborges.bandcamp.com/). Prior to this, she released music as [lonely carp](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0n7d5KiQLCVSD2WsdTn9sF?si=7u-XjMLIRPWlEaTiAiO7GQ) and [CARPVS MORTVVM](https://carpvs.bandcamp.com/album/the-woman-in-the-ward-chapels-wallpaper-working-title-lonely-carp-final-release-under-this-moniker-final-title-the-woman-locked-in-the-ward-out-of-the-chapels-wallpaper-draft).[28] As lonely carp, she released several works including the album _[KATABASIS](https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/lonely-carp/katabasis-an-underworld-opera/): an underworld opera_,[[1]](https://www.somegreatreward.scot/lonely-carp-katabasis-an-underworld-opera) an [experimental live opera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera "Opera") of noise composition and ritual [theatre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_theatre "Experimental theatre") which developed a significant following.[29] She premiered _KATABASIS_ at [Summerhall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summerhall)'s Anatomy Lecture Theatre, a converted veterinary school space featuring raised wooden horseshoe seating,[30] over a series of two intimate performances in Edinburgh.[4] The concerts involved gradually stripping naked to expose vulnerability, thematically exploring [survival sex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_sex "Survival sex"), a form of sex work prevalent amongst trans women,[31] often rooted in [socio-economic marginalisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_exclusion "Social exclusion").[31] She also performed _KATABASIS_ at the [StagEHd festival](https://stagehdfestival.wordpress.com/) in the [Ross Bandstand](https://rossbandstand.org/), an open-air stadium in [Princes Street Gardens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princes_Street_Gardens "Princes Street Gardens").

She has appeared on the compilation cassette _No Authority Without Corruption, No Power Without Abuse_,[32] released by the label [Venalism](https://venalism.bandcamp.com/), which she is currently signed to.[33] A forthcoming double cassette release on Venalism, titled _Xˡᶦᵇʳᶦˢ_ ,[34] extends her literary practice through a noise-based conceptual framework.[33]

Petal’s first ever musical performance was at age 18, supporting [Diane Cluck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Cluck "Diane Cluck") at the [Tin Music and Arts](https://thetinmusicandarts.org.uk/events/?category=music&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=7626677415&gbraid=0AAAAAC7Su5mpGLckhr9AulPYB9VAh3L-3&gclid=Cj0KCQjwotDBBhCQARIsAG5pinNpiNmqrRTckYMAjYfhezgL1z8DkhuXXDjsktyqQLvWasc2POXmQbMaAloQEALw_wcB) in [Coventry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coventry "Coventry").[35] She has supported the Melbourne duo [Divide and Dissolve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide_and_Dissolve "Divide and Dissolve") at [The Hug and Pint](https://www.thehugandpint.com/) in Glasgow, in 2022.[36] She also supported [Extra Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra_Life_\(band\)) at a Venalism-organised show at The Banshee Labyrinth in Edinburgh.[12][37] That same year, Petal performed in the full [Edinburgh Fringe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_Festival_Fringe) run of _SHE/HER_, produced by [Brian Cox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Cox_\(actor\) "Brian Cox (actor)") and Actor Rising Productions.[38] Her musical performance, combining an original vocal and accordion composition with interpretive dance, earned standout reviews[39][40] for its emotional intensity and storytelling.[41]

**Style and influences**

Petal’s multidisciplinary practice integrates experimental literature,[4] abrasive music production[47] (often accompanying visceral ritual performance)[2], and digitally innovative [alternate reality game (ARG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_reality_game "Alternate reality game") creation.[48] These elements coalesce in her broader framework of _Lexicomythography_, an interwoven system of symbolic expression grounded in mythopoesis and semiotic design. She employs a “noise alchemist” approach,[3] integrating ritual structure and semiotics within an "artifact-as-artefact"[1] framework.[49] Her sonic practice treats breakdown and distortion not as flaws but as compositional forces.[22] Loss, grief, and otherness emerge as structural catalysts of affect and form within her broader conceptual themes.[50]

Her trans identity and lived experience inform much of her work’s thematic exploration.[18][49][31]

Her literary practice employs fragmentation, redaction, and intentional illegibility,[28] aligning with principles of contemporary noise literature, paralleling her sonic work.[51] Her "page-as-performance"[1] work engages with [self-reflexive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-reference "Self-reference") [narrative techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative_techniques "Narrative techniques"),[52] exploring textual instability and reader positioning. This [metafictional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metafiction "Metafiction") methodology employs [intertextuality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertextuality "Intertextuality") by embedding fictional publications[53] as [fractalised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal "Fractal") texts within the overarching narrative.[54]

ⁿᵒᵗBorges is both her musical [moniker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moniker "Moniker")[55] and an umbrella [pseudonym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonym "Pseudonym") for her large-scale literary projects[56], the latter encompassing over one million words,[57] structured as a layered, [recursive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion "Recursion") universe, composed of cryptic fragments and multimedia forms.[8] According to Petal’s own conceptual framing, ⁿᵒᵗBorges functions as an inversion of Borges’ literary approach: rather than merely referencing fictional works, it actively creates[58] the fictional, nested sources,[59] deepening the labyrinthine dialogue between the story and its own references.[60] This approach embodies a self-described “neophilological”[61] practice, synthesising chaotic, hypergraphic and compulsive art[28] with stillness and structure, likened to genetic material dissolved and rebound as triple strands[62] — an [alchemical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemy "Alchemy") metaphor for the project’s self-replicating, interwoven layers.[63]

**Immersive Storytelling and Metanarrative Work**

Petal’s durational narrative project incorporates fictional languages,[15][16] mythopoeic systems,[53] and interlinked documents[17] distributed across textual, sonic, visual, performative, and digital forms. Petal has described her narrative work as “a durational literary project that will undoubtedly last the rest of [her] life”, stating that she aims “to frame the conditions of marginalisation [she], and so many others have been dealt, not as absences, but as generative states of meaning.”[9]

Petal coined _Lexicomythography_,[1] a [pseudo-academic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-academic "Pseudo-academic") field that centres mythopoesis through [etymology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymology "Etymology") and dissection of The Word, as both a creative schema and a critical commentary on the exclusionary politics of traditional academia,[1] particularly from the perspective of a queer, disabled woman in STEM.[19] Through _Lexicomythography_ and the compilation of a Dictionary, the ever-evolving _lexDict_,[17] Petal explores the spiritual resonance of language, recursive meaning-making, and the generative power of myth as a counterpoint to rigid scientific structures, challenging conventional boundaries between science, art, and identity.[9] It forms the basis of her multiyear project, _The Children’s Gospel Music Songbook_,[64] one of the narrative fictional canons within the wider ⁿᵒᵗBorges multiverse. She presents _ARIA|DNE_, the Society of _Lexicomythographers_, as a secretive group,[8] compiling dictionaries[17] and creating intentionally obfuscated, recursive texts[65] as a form of transmedia ritual and creative resistance.[66]

She maintains multiple independently-produced, continuously updated digital platforms as part of the _Lexicomythography_ project,[4] along with a regularly updated GitHub profile[67] of multiple in-universe repositories,[68] featuring narrative threads encoded within pull requests and commit messages.[69] These repositories serve not only as technical infrastructure, but as canonical extensions of the _Lexicomythography_ multiverse, embedding recursive narrative logic and symbolic lexicons into the very architecture of their version control.[70] Many serve as Trailheads (ARG entry points,[4] the first of which was introduced via post linking to the initiation video[71] by the artist on the subreddit r/ARG),[72] including:

An interactive [command-line interface (CLI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface "Command-line interface") (and in-universe entity)[48], the _Children’s Gospel Music Songbook'_s 'Choose Your Own Adventure' applet[73] and digitised manuscript portal[64], a podcast integrating AI-generated segments,[66] along with the _‘Journals of ARIA|DNE_ pseudo-academic repository[74], which frames the narrative universe through layers of '[institutional access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_publishing "Academic publishing")'. These sites function both as [art objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_objects "Art objects") and as active interfaces for the immersive ARG-like narrative she creates, blending [magick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceremonial_magic "Ceremonial magic"), software development, scientific method, and trans [mysticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysticism "Mysticism") into the [secret society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_society "Secret society") lens that permeates her fictional multiverse.[71][9]

**Personal life**

Petal lives and works in Scotland. She has publicly discussed her experiences living with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome,[22] a connective tissue disorder that impacts her mobility and energy levels, shaping many aspects of her daily life and creative practice. The condition posed challenges to her medical transition.[20] She has written about undergoing gender-affirming surgeries in personal essays scattered across her website.[93] She continues hormone replacement therapy, as documented in the short film ‘‘What It Means to Be’’.[11]

Petal has openly described experiencing psychotic episodes, including symptoms such as [hypergraphia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergraphia "Hypergraphia") and [clanging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clanging "Clanging"), which she integrates into her creative methodology.[94] These experiences are narrativised by the pseudonymous persona ‘The Woman in the Wallpaper’,[95] credited as the author of _The Children’s Gospel Music Songbook_[64]—a central text in the recursively layered universe of _Lexicomythography_.[28]

The project was initiated during a psychiatric hospitalisation in late 2024,[64] and its core text, _RED_RING_PARALLEL_,[96] encodes these events within deeply layered [metatext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatextuality "Metatextuality"),[8] accessible only through oblique traversal of her site’s symbolic architecture.[97]

Petal is also neurodivergent, and has spoken about being autistic and having ADHD,[3] and experiencing traits associated with schizotypal perception and cognition.[98] Her creative practice is informed by considerations of access,[99] disability justice,[18] and the temporal demands of chronic illness[20] and neurodivergence.[11] Petal has spoken about her experiences as a survivor,[100] which inform the themes of grief and resilience across her work. Her advocacy for trauma-informed creative spaces[28] stems in part from these experiences, shaping both her artistic and community engagement.[18] These experiences influence her approaches to pacing, ritual, and the thematic exploration of pain, embodiment, and altered perception across her work.[18]
