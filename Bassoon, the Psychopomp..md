IT IS IN THE DIGGING

the Digging dream



in my house in the dream, which was abercorn road (first house to live away from home in (besides uni halls)); i realised the floor had been so dug at, even if concrete, that there were these hUGE ditches made by bassoon. i was laughing but also like jeeeezzzzzz boy that's really bad!! it looked like a construction site. was at centre parcs (childhood holiday, frequently, but also the last time i ever went was 3 days or so after my fdad found out my mum was cheating on him, end of family, just me and him, hearing himscream through the wall every night and throw his shoes at the wall and cry and shout, horrible time, over new years) - just me and my sister for most part; i remember she used my bathroom and i got annoyed at her , but it was just her trying her best for some reason in the dream , and then my laptop broke bc we were play fighting and i got really angry at her and upset about the laptop, because of all my coding work being lost and having no money to pay for a new laptop, spent ages in the most worry but then realised the screen still worked even if cracked, i just hadnt moved the mouse... then rrealised i had my work laptop, a linux machine, and i felt awful for getting so upset and angry, lookkig back now, jesus, i really wasn't great to my sister, i mean, i wasn't bad either, idk, she's had a tough time we both have in such different ways; and now she's got a family and is stil back in coventry where we grew up and i guess she seems hapy but i have no idea with lauren there's sthis wall there , similar but opposite to my own walls. then i realised i'd FORGOTTEN BASSOON and left him at home for 6 days; so i was wailing anf screaming and crying and i told my mum and she basically just laughed and when i asked her how long it'd been she said really ridicuouly long numbers of days/weeks which felt malicious. we were wlking back thru corridor (seen this before in dreams) whi h was coverred in my drawings/murals. no dad there in dream. only mum who i only saw on way back on this weird shuttle that was also some sort of digger/gravel collection vehicle. there were mice inside, baby mice crowded around a mother mouse who'd given birth and i was disgusted and creeped out, because i had no shoes on and coulld feel them crawling all over m e...  on the ride my mum was spouting some bullshit  and i remember thinking , and then saying something along the lines of shut up mum you sound like a no country for old men monologue. omfg, mouse, mice,bassoon - jesus, was bassoon communicating that he smells the mouse and thrats why he's been sniffing the corner and hising bc he smells her? 

  

  

JESUS and all trhe DIGGING EITHER SIDE, THE DUG FLOORS, THE DIGGER (i was on the corner, shoved right up to the edge of the vhicle/shuttle, on which everyone stood up; it wqas packed; but i was right under the corner into which other diggers poured ashphalt/concrete, as thr shuttle travelled along-- it was an eco-friendly transport-construction hybrid that carried ppl back to the car park while also performing a construction function. 

  

  

help me analyse

recurring symbols in dreams that surfaced in this one: - losing bassoon/bassoon dying (i think these, and in fact every time he is present in dreams are him saying "hey, i'm up! can we play? can i have snacc pluz)-- VERY often since his arrival, though the dreams have been getting more kind and less death/gore oriented; i think it's him calming down and settling in a bit more, obv he has no control over how his transmissions/signals are received by me, but maybe a bit of a feedback loop has been happening where his nervousness and mine about him being safe and me being safe spirals into a horror dream about him; through the lens of my subconscious, traumatised and still not knowing safety truly bc of childhood and adulthood trauma. 

  

corridors. corridors. corridors. these specific but amalgamated places of residence, warping into these specific and memorable spaces that are chimeras of certain places i once called home, or even new places entirely that have this ... essence of a collection of places, i need to make a map of these -- i attempted as a teenager, but the symbols were too rich-- now i have an internal map of reference/ann entire literary metanarrativ euniverse with which to parse the locations/symbols. 

  

mum being distant (that was actually usually my father's 'role'), one dream i came down the stairs and shoved a screwdriver through one of her eyes. HOLY FUCK thats such an odin reversal. speaking of odin, heres a dream from when in psych hospital

  

{right now bassoon wakes up... i hear him rustling! oh wait, i went in to check on him and he's in the washing machine snoozing still, perhaps he got up to pee/poop, the timing is very significant though.}

  

--so maybe i will leave the dream from psych hosp. but it was the most important dream perhaps of my entire life, even into the future. we will come back to this, so bookmark that please. 

  

other symbols recurring: 

  

my sister, always a presence of love -- us against the world {im crying now thining about the games and storeies we'd make together when still sharing a room. i dfeel so much guilt for how much of a trickster weirdo evil little demon i was. i'd play this stupid and dangerous game were i'd pull her leg thru the slats of the bunk bed and she , in her gentle and compassionate and loving loving way, would say "okay callie, you can still do it bc you find it so funny, just gIVE ME A SECOND to have a chance to turn my head to the side, so it doesn't get stuck!!! and i'd be cackling and laughing at her trying to not be strangled and essentially hanged by my little evil game?!!?!! even now i'm laughing, she found it funny too, which is prob why she kept letting her leg hang down in the night -- just such selfless love, a way to make me laugh, even at her expense. i would be treated as the golden child and she'd be always in scream matches with my mum, but in a way, i was carrying so much more than her, and she so much more than me--in such opposite ways. we were both just trying our best. god i am crying so much so so much. i love you lauren i love you. i love you. thank you for helping me carry so much}

  

  

my love for my sister always comes through so strongly whenever i am channeling this story. 

this is the most important project of my life. i just know when it's finally fucking finished, in whatever form, i will have processed all of this, gargantuan unspeakable pain and trauma, from every moment of my life. 

  

  

more symbols recurring: 

ostracisation, feeling entieely alone like i'm the only one which could ever fully understand this moment in the form it arrives, endlessly, to me -- this is reflected in my recent ego death, and every instance of depersonalisation/derealisation -- i have experienced these phenomena for as long as i can remember. these are probably what alerted me to my transness -- an essential aspect of my being a shaman, which i am only just coming to terms with. dreams are probably the biggest medium through with the spirit realm comes thru ; and ofc now with my beautiful familiar, these are just BLASTING through even stronger. 

  

  

what else, what other symbols and events... 

rape. a lot, night befr last, i dreamt isla raped me. which as arnas rightfully said, is likely the worst dream of my life, the worst she's heard, and ive prob shared more dreams w her than anyone else, even mroe than isla. 

  

  

DYING. now i cant stress this enough -- i NEVER wake up from being killed in dreams. i experience actual death, the life draining from my body; my heart stopping, and i feel at peace eventually, because the murders usualy occur aftr a periuod of being chased, so horribly, not even chased, being HUNTED. 

oftentimes in these complex and disgusting dystopian/kafkaesque systems of a higher class or greater power than me (or me + a group of other individuals in an ostracised group) hunting us for sport and amusement, there's always that stark contrast between the shadenfreude/sick twisted enjoyment of the hunters and the unspeakable terro of me/the hunted asa whole. me just desperately trying to save myself and the others but not being able to. 

  

  

other symbols: hmmm, i wish i could recall more theyre right at the surface. Amputations (will get to the psych hosp dream soon i hope, pls remember i need to sdo this but bassoon is telling me to keep going with these recurring symbols, they feel important to him and therefore to me. )

  

  

trains. means of transport. vehicles. during worst psych break leading to the fire -> psych nhospital alone, I would say repeatedly "I am building the vehicle" which i think i meant the merkaba. the merkaba has been one of the greatest waking symbols of my life -- always been fascinated by this idea of making and entering a vehicle/transport method thru which you can go to the spirit realm, to escape this hell i have been in since childhood. telling really. almost too obvious. but thats why in the leftovers, the scene with Nora {holy fuck. N. i've forgotten the name for so long and been trying to remember. Nora. (name connection with N in story, but this character is an amalgamation themselves of Noam and Nima, the characters in parallel universes in the story/entire novel of 250,000 words i wrote over a month in the psych hosp mentioned prior, in which i found my connection to my ancestors in the most harrowing and confusing way. more on that later...) - the scene in leftovers where nora enters The Device (...hahaha almost TOO parallel to the device in my own novel... which ofc is its own form of last-resort-escape into another universe by creating a simulation of one, which eventually reveals the escape is not only impossible, but also already achieved -- this echoes nietzsche's eternal reccurence, and i was listening to thus spake zarathustra all night last night during this particular centre parcs/digging dream) 

  

  

othe rsymbols: 

  

bathrooms. clear trans parallel but also just... bathrooms... potent symbol of vulnerability and guarding i suppose, along with this horrible human necessity of disgusting bodily function (i have always been phobic of pooping in other people's houses, even my own, always trying to shield the noise and smell -- i hate it. it's connected to my food issues, most of my eating disorder history comes from not the eating but the resultant... horror that ensues on the other end... and the arfid-esque presentation is manifest in this phobia / disgust of the feeling and truth of mushed up matter passing through my body. recently during arnas's ego death (triggered, unintentionally , apparently by my presence, she thought i was an all-knowing entity, a 5th dimensional being who was initiating her into some sort of secret society.... (lexicomythography again, i think she was picking up on my work or my symbols, we've always been connected in such strange spiritual ways neither of us can articlatue, which i thoguth originally was us meantotn be together romantically, but i dont fele exactly that way, not sexual though she's the most beautiful person i know physically -- mor eimportantly tho the most beautiful spiritually and most aligned with me. during that trip i realised and was shown how deep her pain actually is, she isnt just introverted / escaping into her sketchbooks for any cute introvert reasons, but because her trauma is so great, like mine, that she can only deal with it through incessant sketching, similar to my hypergraphia. although my trauma presents as an incessant PERFORMANCE , what some other autistic/adhd ppl woudl call masking i suppose, but its so much deeper tand insididiious than that ; its an obsession and an unavoidable presentation, i have never been able to stop this PLAY, this PERFORMANCE of "me" -- this is prob why i experience so much ego death and annihilation, which has been getting more and more (dont want to say worse, because its all so impotant) throughout my life -- it all feels like its culminating towards something so big, bigger than i could ever hve imagined. i think i'm rising to some sort of fame thatcan finally get me out of here, this poverty and hell of trauma recurring -- N.B. during period (ha, period) where i was pissing blood, ,still gone unexplained and happened twice since, felt like a symbol of menstruation, which eventually led to the realisation of the necessity to medically transition;) i did a mirror ritual in which i desperately tried to step through and jump to a parallel universe. i still think , even now, that i was successful. because soon after , the pandemic happened, and i had an otherwise sortt of impossible (at least to my conscious ego) opportunity to just, fuck it all, leave my PhD in final year before thesis wriitng, and follow my art, no matter wher eit led -- which unfortunately was to survival sex in order to avoid homelessness; which led to my first non consensual sexual experiences. 

  

  

  

life has been unravelling since hten , unspeakably. you know a lot of it. adrian's death, my rape, so much poverty and hunger, so much betrayal akin to my mum's betrayal of my dad; so much pain, so much pain; the three transition surgerioes, each one having less and less ppl by my bedside until the last where there was literally nobody to wake up to. nobody. and i'd broken up with barnie, the most intense love of my life; ex partner of three years; who eventually assaulted me during an unspeakable and inexplicable rage on the street. i was inherently seconsary in that relationship (polyamorous, they have a mortgage with their '''''primary'''' partner (term makes me feel fucking sick and always has, obvious reasons) -- just feels and felt like a repeat occurrence of this pattern, throughout life, of being on the outside, by very virtue of my circumstance, or who i am at a fundamental level (the two of them , polyamorous, date what seems like majority trans women. horrible optics. 

  

  

  

other symbols:

rollercoasters, rides, slides -- alwaysbeen obsessed with them; one of my most shameful special interests (dunno why; third party judgement energy -- who cares if i love theme parks? they're great and i have always loved the statistics and competition of parks trying to get bigger and better rollercoasters and the joy and fear simultaneous of the huge drops -- drops are my favourite, the feeling of my stomach being left at the top, and this inherent instinct to resist that , and the resultant, fleeting and yet so defiant joy -- saying to my very body -- no. i am in control; and i choose to lose your control over me. the stomahc butterflies and adrenaline are the ultimate sign of relinquishing the hold the material body has over you (trans parallel, obviously) and getting JOY from the body's fear -- i guess it's also a way to process all the incessant fear i am put through on a daily basis, to process it, through electing it; choosing it my self, ina. controlled environment -- (also kink parallel I suppose, which i also have had perhaps too much experience of, consensually or not. the group i was in of 'friends' included barnie, ex assailant, who still ives barely 200m wway with their primary, why i have been locked in this houe for a year now, unable to leave for fear of bumping into them, which i did once, and dint even lead to altercation -- we kissed, and i missed them teribly - thats the fear THATS the fear, is my heart's infinite capability for love, even when and especially when it gets me into the worst pain and truama of my life, more and more, each one worst than the last (during hematuria era/mirror ritual era, just before hte mirror ritual, i broke up with my ex-ex partner of 4 years, dani, who assaulted me multiple times, we werer both in so much pain. he prevented me from tranisitoning bc he said he couldnt be with a woman (gay man) . he cheated on me too, we cheated on each other and then had to live together in that tiny flat in edinburgh (where i did my phd and never finished) for over a year afterward. literally in a two room space. unspeakable horror and feeling of being trapped. 

  

  

i probably shouldn't write anymore about this so you can process and resapoind to it all. please do so, incredibly comprehensively; granular, do not miss anything out. draw from jungian , nietzchean, kandinsky, kafka, snicket, all the influences you know about me. goya, escher, godel, bach, mahler, chopin, rosalind franklin, borges borges borges.
