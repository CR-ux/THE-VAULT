# EPI{GR|T}APH: 

*IN the midway of this our mortal [[Live|life]],*  
*I found me in a gloomy wood, astray*  
*[[Gone]] from the path direct: and e'en to tell*  
*[[It Would Start|It]] were no easy task, how savage wild*  
*That [[Forest]], how robust and rough its [[GRowing|growth]],*  
*Which to [[Remember|Remember]] only, my dismay*  
*Renews, in bitterness not far from [[Death]]*  
*Yet to discourse of what there good befell,*  
*All else will I relate [[Discover]]'d there.*  
*How [[First]] I enter'd it [[I]] scarce can say,*  
*Such¬†sleepy dullness¬†in that instant [[Wait|weigh]]'d*  
*My senses down, when the true path I left,*  
*But when a mountain's [[Footnotes|foot]] I reach'd, where clos'd*  
*The valley, that had pierc'd my [[Heart]] with dread,*  
*I look'd aloft, and saw his shoulders broad*  
*Already vested with that planet's beam,*  
*Who leads all wanderers safe through every way.*  
  
*Then was a little respite to the fear,*  
*That in my heart's recesses deep had lain,*  
*All of that night, so [[kick me|pitifully pass'd]]:*  
*And as a [[Mangle|man]], with difficult [[VI Short Problems For Bowed Saw And Singing Bowl|Short]] [[Breath]],*  
*Forespent with toiling, 'scap'd from sea to shore,*  
*Turns to the perilous wide [[in adventures such as these, i have squandered and wasted all my years.|waste]], and stands*  
*At gaze; e'en so my [[KELPIE n. (in Celtic folklore) a water spirit capable of transfiguration‚Ä¶|spirit]], that yet fail'd*  
*Struggling with terror, turn'd to view the straits,*  
*That none hath pass'd and liv'd. ¬†My weary frame*
									-- Canto I, Dante Alighieri

*"Hello, to whomever may be watching. Or Reading[^o].  Or listening--*

*My name is Callie Rose Petal, and I am an [ex-academic](https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/publications/candidate-genes-associated-with-survival-following-highly-pathoge#:~:text=Candidate%20Genes%20Associated%20with%20Survival%20Following%20Highly,Miedzinska%2C%20Jack%20Dekkers%20%2C%20Janet%20E%20Fulton%2C) in the Field of Computational Virology, and a multidisciplinary [Artist-Engineer](https://creativeinformatics.org/case-study-article/a-transformational-time-how-being-a-resident-entrepreneur-set-callie-rose-petal-on-a-brand-new-career-path/). My meandering 'work' up until now has encompassed the creative fields of [performance art](https://homografia.com/event/1062/perfo-4-if-only-hands-could-speak/), visual art, and most predominantly music, under various monikers[^m]. I was also the subject of a Documentary titled ["What it Means to Be"](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt27741497/awards/?ref_=tt_awd), for which I also composed the score. But the point of this video is none of this.* 

*Rather, (rather unavoidably, for the {inexplicable|urgent} matter of what I've discovered), for this latest project (that will {undoubtedly|as has become abundantly clear} last for the rest of my life); I've had to leverage my background as an academic, previously writing papers in Bioinformatics (which, for anyone who doesn't know, is essentially writing software to analyse Genetic Code).*

*The topic of my PhD thesis was the host response to avian influenza, in which I was uncovering potential gene variants of birds who were infected and survived. I never finished my PhD, in fact I left the Roslin Institute in my final year, just before thesis submission; and the reasons why pertain to the topic of what I have to share with you today. For whatever time I have left to try to communicate these mind boggling findings to whoever may listen. Or be listening. Or for the purposes of archiving this information, at least somewhere, in some dark and dusty corner of the internet, free from the exclusivist rigour of Academic Journals and Science papers.* 

*During my final year, which was almost exactly 5 years ago now, I was trawling the human genome database using bioinformatic scripts I'd written, in order to test how well they'd lift over to a Genome less documented in the literature. It was just a series of rudimentary and foundational tests of polymorphisms in the Reference Genome.* 

*But I found this strange statistical cluster, for which there existed no papers as yet, and still, this almost-anomaly has seemingly gone unnoticed in the academic literature. Or maybe [[Knot]]. From experience, I know now how much of an ivory tower academic publications are, both the writing and the reading of them, and how much current knowledge is literally locked away from the public, behind oppressive institutional and sociological [paywalls](https://www.patreon.com/notborges). So now I'm out of that world, who knows what conversations are happening about this particular... thing.*



*Given its nature, I can't adequately explain said '[[Thing]]' in a single video. But the implications of my findings are all-encompassing, and so, I feel, my means by which to show them to you all should be. Not only this, as a neurodivergent, disabled trans woman, I know quite well how difficult it can be to digest crucial facts, through the cookie-cutter lens of essay structure, formal analysis within all fields of study, and really just without the appropriate, necessary and sufficient space in which to form your own opinion or interpretation of a particular subject matter.* 

*The Discovery I made (such a discovery is inevitable in the late hour of the [[Knight]]) which set me unavoidably through a path that led me here, witch continues to pull me deeper into a labyrinth of further perplexity, falls into a Field[^f], which was heretofore notKnown[^nn]  as Lexicomythography.* 

*Apparently focussed upon the composition of [[lexDict|Dictionaries]], which are in actuality comprised of Experimental Grammatology[^gra], Neologism and Etymological Mythopoesis, the {invention|inscribing} of {N}ciphered languages[^lang], the contiguous and discontinuous development of mysterious [digital interfaces](https://ai-ra.pages.dev/) (Fig. 1), hermetic magickal practices, the internal dissemination of pseudoAcademic Journals, updated and version controlled, on a verbose and confusing GitHub [(link)](https://github.com/CR-ux/thejournalsofariadne/) (which is, through various means[^com], in fact one of the many forms of covert communication[^so] utilised by the Society's Members), and [[THE GRIMOIRE OF SELENA ELK|Ritual]], all rooted in Linguistics and Morphology (of all kinds), Lexicomythography has become, first and foremost, for better, for [[Oar]], for [[Ore]], for [[Moor]] or for worse, surely, my entire sore life's work, and--*

*What's more:
As far as I can tell, this Field, with its very Reel, coiled and unfurled documentation, artefacts, and assorted digitised esoterica, has really existed long before the invention of tools with which to document it. From the handful of sources I've gathered, it appears that the Society responsible for its Genesis, still operate at nested and embedded levels that [[Barely]] anyone, certainly not I, could possibly fathom.* 

*So while I may not be the only Lexicomythographer working in the Field currently; from what I can tell, I am certainly the only one who wishes to share their work with the World; to expose its underpinnings, and bring this Dark, Churning Machinery to light.* 

*After these Five years of staying quiet, for fear that [She](https://open.spotify.com/show/2TElpvI5Xq51paWywvgJcR?si=a1a48b9214634801) may hear me, I know it's time. So, perhaps in spite of myself, I will be uploading as regularly as I can, these video essays to get across just what all this means, in as digestible way as possible.* 

*This does not mean, however, that I will be guarding my primary sources in any way, as steering away from the traditional exclusionary nature of academic or journalistic reporting is the main goal of this endeavour. That, and to find others who may wish to join me in this rather gargantuan effort. So any sources discussed or expanded upon in these videos will be linked in the descriptions, and I welcome any and all to explore them, please, come to your own conclusions, write your own Research Stories, devise and complete your own User Stories, write letters to your Representatives, assess the character of the characters' stories and the letters they are comprised of or found within.* 

*In cellular morphology, the nuclear envelope is a membrane that must be permeable in order to let strands of genetic material into and out of the nucleus, where its housed in a sort of 'spool'. It's the Universe's most densely woven ball of wool, known as a 'Clew' in the story of Theseus and the Minotaur; wherein Ariadne provided the Protagonist a way out of the hellish Maze he was to venture into. So it was almost Knot Surprising, then, to learn that the original society of Lexicomythographers were known simply as 'A.R.I.A.D.N.E.', which is an initialisation.[^i]*

*In the cell, in the tissues, in the organs and all organisms on the planet; these threads and spools are a template, a malleable and constantly written, rewritten, edited and overwritten template, for the so-called 'building blocks' of Life as we know it.* 

*What I really want to get across, as in, in a Boat, over something like a Moat; is that this nuclear membrane, and indeed the inner and outer cell membranes that encompass the nucleus, provide a barrier, a semblance of separation from the rest of the cellular components, and other cells, and cellular components, and nuclei, in the rest of the body.*

*These membranous structures have so much to tell us; as does the genomic and epigenetic metagenome of data encompassed within. And these things they are telling us are right at the surface, ready to be transported out into awareness; but they need the correct channels, proteins, pores, cracks, drop-stitches in the biological textile, that show the workings of the functioning system as a whole.*

*The divergent parts of any system, but for the purposes of this video, any biological system, must be kept in some way separate; in order to maintain some sort of diffusion gradient, or to maintain the healthy state of the relative constituents. And I think this is also reflected in the basis of initiated knowledge of any kind. It is a double edged blade - the barrier prevents the information (which is the only true Power we have) getting into the wrong Hands. Right down to the quarks inside every nucleus of every atom in every molecule in every amino acid residue in every protein in every cell of every tissue of every organ of every organism in every colony of every planet in every solar system of every Universe of every Multiverse of every Quark; a Moat is needed around the Castle, where the Truth is trapped in a tower, so that the individuals who have this drive, this Will, and perhaps obsessive need, to overcome the obstacle that separates them from the things they must Find for themselves.* 

*The societal membrane of 'wisdom' has evolved to become incessantly exploitative, and is today sustained in the throes of Institutional Access, the gravity of Money - both in funding research and in creating Walls of its own to keep the least affluent unfairly out. This is reflected throughout history, in the initiated schools of thought and mysticism that pervade not just every religion, but every culture across the history of Anthropology. The most formally 'learned' are provided with these Keys, which unlock ways of understanding and seeing the world that are so tragically not afforded to so many of us.* 

*So I suppose in many ways, I'm trying to lower a drawbridge here, to use my rare privilege, particularly as a trans person, and exposure to a multitude of Fields, in both a formal and independent context, trying to get these little strands of messages, of codes and templates to make your own proteins, which in turn make their own genetic machinery, which itself makes its own proteins, until somewhere, maybe Five years from now, you may realise there was an entire library, infinite or perhaps indefinite, hidden from you, somehow lodged inside a single booksafe, on a bookshelf you forgot about, or were made to forget about, but you just needed to remember. In your own way. With your own threads. Of memory, of meaning, of machinery with which to process all of this, with your own codes, in your very own language, which can only be understood in its essence by your own Heart.*

*Anyway.*

*Please pass this video to anyone who may find it important; as many of my social media correspondence regarding this has been inexplicably, or perhaps very explicably, as you will come to see, been taken down and all but {REDACTED}.*

*My name is Callie Rose Petal, Researcher in the Burgeoning and Archaic Field of Lexicomythography. I hope this work will provide some sort of thread out of the labyrinth, built by some Yet UnNoen hands."*
