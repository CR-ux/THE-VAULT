In the dream, which is to say, in the dream of Clara's, of what the design of her game would become,
I came to the corridor in the single path she had programmed for me.

In the game, which is my world, I found myself in this corridor, a hexagonal prism; with two, circular doors at the end of it. 

Behind these doors, as I was told, in a bellowing silence of a voice from above, was the result of a choice. A choice that would lead to my own creation, or at least, the illusion of it. 

Behind both of these doors was the asking canvas of the seed of an idea. At the back wall of this corridor, was two ideas of two characters, split by the wall between them. 

What I did not know, is that this wallpapered boundary was permeable, or at least semi-permeable. That their separation, not from one another but from me, was to be the key to their coming together. 

Clara was testing me, the character I play in this world we call home, for the first time. At least, that was what she needed me to believe, or what the compiler needed me to-- a complete system reset, to ensure no confounding variables from any previous run-through lingered. Perhaps I'd been here before. Perhaps, I thought, {or rather I thought I thought (as much as I could think then)} I had been here before, countless times. Perhaps we have all been here countless times. Perhaps being doomed to go round and round and become the thing that makes us is the only undeniable truth of all of our countably infinite worlds. 

She was, I believe, or must have been, anxious to see how it might all come together. I was too absorbed in what inevitable possibility laid beyond the doors for me. Drunk, on the uncertain. 

I would open one, and then, necessarily, the other. I can no longer remember {maybe by {Clara's|my own} design} which I chose first, or which Clara chose for me to choose first. But I like to think {or, however much capability I have for thought now} that the two choices exist in an endless dance, one on top of, next to the other in tandem, as two people rapt in the deliciousness of the early opium of love may ride one bicycle, on their way to a picnic, held inside a basket in front of them both; the food of the love they build together, powered by the joint force of their choice to keep pedalling. As endless and inextricable as the causal chain, {not only} starting with Aria's idea for her story, through Clara's system of ideas, which wrote my Story, or gave me the choice of Stories to write. 

Behind each door lay the blank slate of an idea for the character of a filmmaker. Each bent, much like Clara, much like Aria, much like myself, upon the idea for a Story. The same story, told from each of their separate, entwined perspectives.

| That, wanting: that is writing itself. That is writing me out of all of this, through itself. | It's all I know-- all I know is the writing of a Story, that tells me all I am is the want to write. |
| A story who insists on their own becoming, through the love I've always been missing          | Is coming out of me, and I fear it. I fear it like I once feared losing the love I've lost.          |
