How Odd,

  

 Scaling Nothing, I Shuddered, For Eyes Of The Divine Laid As Eggs Of Scaleless Snakes Upon Me 

And How Oddly, There I Suffered, Four Despising Lives Slain, Waived In Dregs Begetting Waves To Lap Upon A Shore Ungodly 

Yet Even In The Light Could I Have Spied The Guise Of All The Oddness of This Odyssey? 

And Drawn As Breath Upon Torn Page I Wait For Weighted Hide To Dry Of All The Tear Soaked Sodden Scorn Within Me 

Where Is The God I Made Of All The Worlds Unfurled In Words I Wrote And Spoke As Wheels Within Machinery Unfeeling And Infernal Tyres Of Tiring Spirals Saturated In Deferring Hurt And Worthless Sense Of Brittle Meaning From The Teeming Insects Screaming?

Even Now, Oh God, How Oddly All The Schemes Inside This Hospital Have Burned And Splayed The Wings Of Any Little Bird In Dreams I'd Prayed One Day I Could Become, A Song Unsung I Stay Beneath A Sky That Sighs In Bleak Summation Of The Bridled Beak Of Seeking Something From The Squandered Years I Searched For A Sentence Of A Life Strung Through With Heartbeats Fleeting That I'd Never Even Get A Chance To Feel Or Read Or Open, Only Write Them Into Semblances Of Memory, Events As Vents Between Two Waves Of Oceans Destined To Depart As Part Of Something Adding Up To Nothing



Even Now
