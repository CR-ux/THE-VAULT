**SYMPHONY NO. 8 in e flat, made yer** 

"Symphony of Ten Thousand" or "Things"

---


The heavy, heavy, mahogany double doors open.
You enter.
The air of the room is just cold enough to be uncomfortable. Just cold enough for you to see your shivering breath stretch out in front of you, like a silver cord suggesting a path you might take, but probably shouldn't have. 

The dancing strands of your breath unfurl into a thick, inescapably odious Field of disinfectant that hangs like an innocent woman suspected of being a Witch- which you unconsciously identify as Iodine[^lexDef_io_1]; whether from your own personal experience of Surgeries, or the olfactory trauma of association, passed down through generations in your epigenome. This sensory element is a detail you aren't aware was intentionally placed in the room by the artist. 

Before you there are are two paths. Forged in the not-white, yellowed tile. Holding secrets of its own, the stains, locked within the grout, hold countless screams, machined hums, poorly overwritten blood splatter, and silent anaesthetic sighs. 

The paths are symmetrical, but not identical. Not to the keen observer. Not to you. 
Both of them together form two switchback-ramp serpents; two halves of an infernal ribcage- garlanding the central spinal column of an Old Operating Theatre, where the Beating Heart of the performance promises to take place. 

You've never seen one quite like this, for they don't exist anymore, and yet, in the marrow of your soul, you feel its unsettling familiarity. 

There is something nailed violently into a wide, thin tile, directly in front of you as you enter. The tile's fragility a windowsill surrogate, just beneath an oily-fingerprint-smudged-glass screen. This panel, this impermeable membrane of melted sand separates you, as Thisbe from Pyramus, or as a foetus from the incompatibility of her mother's blood. Between you and the hiding tile is a single, unshaven shred, of what appears to be goat hide. The sheer force of the nail's driving into the ceramic has left a large crack, running from left to right, or perhaps equally, from right to left; a broken, nameless Usher, welcoming you, from whichever side you wish--

Every Trial-- 
whether by Fire's Uproar,
or Flood's Outpour, 
by Half-Seeing Disc, or Scalpel's Sword--
Has a Sentence it must fall before. 

A Sentence is an arrow, Lettered, 
No matter to which tongue it's fettered, 
It reads from one Beginning Side, 
to another's Ending, with the Tide.
Every End's Direction depends 
Upon the Hand that it perpends.
And every Written Word is birthed
From mortar’s womb within the Earth.
Post-letters, where our fullness stops;
The Bodies of our Life's Work crops.


Other audience members who have entered the space are already beginning to make their 'choice'. (You are not the first. Nor will you be the last).

Mahler’s SYMPHONY NO. 9 is in _D major_ and is often seen as a farewell or a statement on life, death, and transcendence, reflecting Mahler’s own struggles with mortality. The symphony is emotionally complex, featuring a mixture of defiance, resignation, and ultimate peace. It is sometimes called a “reconciliation with death” or the “final summation.”

And so, you are presented with the illusion of your own:

⧖eno, Now, One-Eyed, forever stuck in the Revolving door of the Indefinite Library of Fable, performed their function, as an insect carries ten times its body weight, headed to an endpoint unknown, only felt, by deeply embedded code, with no thought of Why; as Z terminates the Alphabet, with no thought of Y.

The Prayers of the World below, or within, cycled in the reflections of those Four doors in the shape of an X, as in, the spot ⧖eno was forever Marked within. The Prayers of the Souls Of The World Are Held In Their Dreams. And given the incomplete dissolution of their form {thanks (or no-thanks), to the Endivean Corneal Implant (placed into their Missing Eye \[which now lay rotting|buzzing with drosophila upon that surgical theatre-turned-hellish-performance space, following the final descent of the Curtain]} they were bound, captured in this web, stuck for eternity at this particular boundary, not made of burgundy velvet, but a sickly, yellowish glass, their Sacred, or Infernal task, was to record and analyse them. 


DREAM INPUT:

![[VI. THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO THE LUSTING CANDLE]]

{REDACTED}

The Cruel Irony of utilising her parents final, unfinished, collaborative paper as the main source of reference for the most recent dream, of one dreamer named {REDACTED}, was not lost on them. But, as would be the case for any Entity trapped within that ever-turning Door, rapt in revolving motion that half-remembered Gate, was wrapped in a certain emotionlessness. ⧖eno had, in the Realm of 'Reæl' Forms, been reduced to a single, non-functioning eye, and here, in the 'Reæl' of 'What For's, reduced to a single, sightless function -- our performer, doomed to perform it, forevermore.
