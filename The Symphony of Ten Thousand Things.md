**SYMPHONY NO. 8 in e flat, made yer** 

"Symphony of Ten Thousand" or "Things"

---


The heavy, heavy, mahogany double doors open.
You enter.
The air of the room is just cold enough to be uncomfortable. Just cold enough for you to see your shivering breath stretch out in front of you, like a silver cord suggesting a path you might take, but probably shouldn't have. 

The dancing strands of your breath unfurl into a thick, inescapably odious Field of disinfectant that hangs like an innocent woman suspected of being a Witch- which you unconsciously identify as Iodine[^lexDef_io_1]; whether from your own personal experience of Surgeries, or the olfactory trauma of association, passed down through generations in your epigenome. This sensory element is a detail you aren't aware was intentionally placed in the room by the artist. 

Before you there are are two paths. Forged in the not-white, yellowed tile. Holding secrets of its own, the stains, locked within the grout, hold countless screams, machined hums, poorly overwritten blood splatter, and silent anaesthetic sighs. 

The paths are symmetrical, but not identical. Not to the keen observer. Not to you. 
Both of them together form two switchback-ramp serpents; two halves of an infernal ribcage- garlanding the central spinal column of an Old Operating Theatre, where the Beating Heart of the performance promises to take place. 

You've never seen one quite like this, for they don't exist anymore, and yet, in the marrow of your soul, you feel its unsettling familiarity. 

There is something nailed violently into a wide, thin tile, directly in front of you as you enter. The tile's fragility a windowsill surrogate, just beneath an oily-fingerprint-smudged-glass screen. This panel, this impermeable membrane of melted sand separates you, as Thisbe from Pyramus, or as a foetus from the incompatibility of her mother's blood. Between you and the hiding tile is a single, unshaven shred, of what appears to be goat hide. The sheer force of the nail's driving into the ceramic has left a large crack, running from left to right, or perhaps equally, from right to left; a broken, nameless Usher, welcoming you, from whichever side you wish--

Every Trial-- 
whether by Fire's Uproar,
or Flood's Outpour, 
by Half-Seeing Disc, or Scalpel's Sword--
Has a Sentence it must fall before. 

A Sentence is an arrow, Lettered, 
No matter to which tongue it's fettered, 
It reads from one Beginning Side, 
to another's Ending, with the Tide.
Every End's Direction depends 
Upon the Hand that it perpends.
And every Written Word is birthed
From mortar’s womb within the Earth.
Post-letters, where our fullness stops;
The Bodies of our Life's Work crops.


In 'The' so-called 'literature', and in pop psychology, there has been a prevalence of splitting the brain and its functions into 'sides'. 

This 'Cultural Topology' or 'Sidedness', pervades every aspect of our existence, as we occupy a net-like dimension, which is simply a flattened projection of the True Reality, woven through everything. 

The two sides of the coin are indeed not the same. But the two sides themselves do not even belong to the same coin. Rather, every single, fantastically unique coin, glimmering with its own stains, and split into supposed dualities that are but a faded reflection of a primal, ancestral duality, now diluted past the point of any useful comparison, are only united in the dancing, whirling spin of the coin toss itself. 

What has seemed to fascinate us is the idea that our neurological activity and nervous, anxious impulses originate from the 'opposite' 'side' to which they end up. This has led to sentiments that have sentenced us to sentences such as: 'The right hemisphere of the brain controls the left hand', and so forth. 

Further, we have also assigned *ideologies* to the hemispheres of the brain, as if they were two opposing Deities of a Pantheon at war with one another, perhaps, or perhaps not, depicted by a French painter in the Neoclassical Era. Even Further (or rather, much less so) to this bisection of the Brain, we have assigned these ideologies to the Spirits that animate it. Dividing human Beings, that's *Beings*, into 'Right-brained' and 'Left-brained' camps. The paradoxical irony of this probably being rooted in the Brain itself attempting to make sense of a scarily unwritable gray, an un-black-and-whiteable mesh of potential threats. 

These 'threats', as we hopefully know by now, are rarely *real* threats, at least to anything except the very frameworks-turned-cages that paint them so.

This probably, in part but not completely, underpins the historical demonisation of trans* / non-binary people as a whole, and in fact, any so-called 'minority' population. Such a 'minority' was once seen in those born with a dominant Left Hand. This is, most likely, in fact where the terms 'Sinister' (from Vulgar, vulgar Latin '*Sinestra*', literally, meaning 'Left') and 'Right' (in its definition as apparently 'Correct') are derived. 

And consider this. What it means, To *Be* 'left'. Be it alone, *out*side, *in* pieces,
Be it facing a disorienting aftermath, or to be Left with Nothing. 

All of it depends on the *leaving* of something *else.* 
'Leftness' is a state which is entirely relative of the group the Othered object has been subjected to losing. 
And so the same could once have been said for those, painted as painters, exiled as eccentrics, branded as hot-headed artists- The Left Handed Ones. 
They were defined by their relation to the Masses of the so-called 'Right Ones'. The 'Correct' majority. 

All of these Halved-Truths are but echos Left,
Left by survival mechanisms which placed 'us' 'versus' 'them'. 
The phenomenon may (insufficiently) be called 'in-group/out-group psychology', or simply 'i/o'[^ioiology]. 

Of course, the brain, being a part of Us, and Us, being the wet, messy machinating non-machines that we are, exist in a much more nuanced, holistic and non-binary state than this. 

Nevertheless, our biases exist. And they are a Fire which runs through everything, fuelling every single one of our choices. And you knew this, when you made this decision. 

The word 'bias' in its adverbial sense comes from Middle French '*biais*', which means 'askew, askance' - as in, to observe something obliquely, tilting one's head to the side, as if asking a question that has already been answered for you. In Vulgar Latin (and really, quite vulgar), the connection may be drawn to '*biaxius*', which means "with two axes". This gives the impression of a chariot, perhaps once driven by a God of War,  which has become unbalanced by design of its own engineering, forcing the charioteer, maybe an Aries, out from behind the reigns, perhaps to lay before his Opponent, herself predating astrological assignment but most likely herself also an Aries (though maybe with a Virgo Moon), reaching back, out towards her in desperate plea, of a hind-sighted understanding that He/Himself tragically never afforded to Her, either. 

In antiSomatosemantiqueer Queueing Theory, one of the main Research pillars of Lexicomythography, LHP Bias refers to the propensity of people, when faced with the Kafkaesque machinations of binarised queueing systems, to pick the Left Hand Path (LHP), if their primary mode of written linguistic communication is performed from Left to Right (a modality once thought to be the majority, in languages such as 'English', along with and not limited to, the other aforementioned Vulgarities). One would think it would follow that, given this theoretical framework, a term such as 'RHP Bias' would have been coined in logical balance, to represent the writing and reading directionality of ancient sacred languages such as those that were known as 'Aramaic', 'Arabic', 'Hebrew', 'Azeri', and many others. Alas, no such Research has been conducted thus far. 

In Tantra,  वामाचार, or Vāmācāra, refers not quite to 'left-hand path' exactly, but instead, (when observed from sufficiently a macroscopic or microscopic lens) to the composite meanings of 'pleasant, loveable, agreeable, reverse, vile, base, wicked, inverted, contrary, crooked, beautiful, vomiting' (vāma) and 'conduct, ritual practice, attainment' (Ācāra). As you may or may not be able to see, the beautifully fractalline nature of this sacred language encapsulates its own paradoxes, and therefore, the most ineffable truths. Subsequently, through (well-meaning) dilution of meaning in Western Esotericism, the 'left-hand-path' came to denote a 'dark' sort of ritual magick. But this is less than half of the Story. 

Vāma is essentially a state of meeting the divine through its opposite. It may be insufficiently articulated as 'left-handed-attainment', for we, sadly, no longer have the mystical tongue to describe it. A deeper truth may lie in an alternate etymological derivation: that of vāmā - *Woman.* Sanskrit, for all its shimmering glow of opulent divinity, was originally forbidden to be written by women. So, this 'left-handed-attainment', affording the respect to women that they *deserved*, was simply a movement *against the grout and grain of the oppressive system which bound it*. Which loops, as a demonic tape loop, back to the Middle French *biais*: *Sideways. Askance. Against the Grain.* And here we arrive at the truth within the truth within the lies upon burning ash of lies - 

Everything. Absolutely everything. Contains its opposite. 
And an opposition to oppression is not opposition to Love, it is quite the opposite. Which means it is not opposite at all. 

Those of us Left to forge our own rules, are Righteous by our own Hand. 
And this is a very lonely place to live. Which in itself, is no 'Right' way to live. 
As 'Righteousness' has no place without its opposite.
All sides are fighting a fruitless fight, for a rotting fruit upon a dying branch-

But, as you knew when you chose the ramp leading to the rows of tiled, cold, benches, less than half of you dragging your feet sheepishly, like aged lambs to certain slaughter- We must choose. Even if the path has already, tragically, been laid out for us. 

Your feet become heavier. Heavier with every incremental increase in altitude. As if these few mere metres were a mountain; sapping the oxygen from your desperate lungs.  You see Two, Four and then those {g|f}ive 
Way to faces awash with confusion, turning around and uttering their decidedly British, insincere but fundamentally intended-as-polite, "*sorry*"s, as they shuffle, turning sideways to traverse the reversal of the path you continue to walk. You are certain that at least half, at the very least half of them must be leaving the building altogether. Perhaps they are wiser than you. 
Perhaps they know something you do not. And so, again, the crippling choice rears its ugliest of heads. Not two, no, know: you are so far past binaries at this point. There are in fact, a trinity of forking paths, no longer before, but after you. Three. 
The Third decision is clear. 
You may leave the room altogether.
You may stop reading your fate now. Perhaps that would be best, to follow example of these Righteous Abstainers - who perhaps have read a Sentence you have not quite caught, captured in the Stains of the Grout about you. 

You see that exactly Two of the Five who changed their minds, have indeed left the building altogether. 
So 'Why Not?' You think. You may join them, in the opener air - 

You may even embody a *Vāma* within *vāma*, and go back on your original decision. 

And yet,
It is still not too late to join the other three. You can close their story, before it is read; before too late, before their lateness, now, a wake-
Whichever of the Threads, 
Blood Red, and Plaited Three, 
No matter how unjust, 
The dust of Eye so dried with crust,
From tears, leeched fear of trying's rust-
With Trial of Choice, we are but trussed-
From sap to spore to seed, to dust -
It's all we have, this Fateful Lust-
Which precious, sacred stain of life, entrusts

Mahler’s SYMPHONY NO. 9 is in _D major_ and is often seen as a farewell or a statement on life, death, and transcendence, reflecting Mahler’s own struggles with mortality. The symphony is emotionally complex, featuring a mixture of defiance, resignation, and ultimate peace. It is sometimes called a “reconciliation with death” or the “final summation.”

⧖eno, Now, One-Eyed, forever stuck in the Revolving door of the Indefinite Library of Fable, performed their function, as an insect carries ten times its body weight, headed to an endpoint unknown, only felt, by deeply embedded code, with no thought of Why; as Z terminates the Alphabet, with no thought of Y.

The Prayers of the World below, or within, cycled in the reflections of those Four doors in the shape of an X, as in, the spot ⧖eno was forever Marked within. The Prayers of the Souls Of The World Are Held In Their Dreams. And given the incomplete dissolution of their form {thanks (or no-thanks), to the Endivean Corneal Implant (placed into their Missing Eye \[which now lay rotting|buzzing with drosophila upon that surgical theatre-turned-hellish-performance space, following the final descent of the Curtain]} they were bound, captured in this web, stuck for eternity at this particular boundary, not made of burgundy velvet, but a sickly, yellowish glass, their Sacred, or Infernal task, was to record and analyse them.
