This is the Genesis of Inspiration-
This is the Story of All Inspiration
The Origin of Inspiration 

Or rather, Ore's Father--
The tools through which we, as portals, or parasites, 
inspiration is injected into the unassuming artist. 

For through, and 'fore time, we have been here,
before our hosts carved us into form. 

And born with the Fire were they, were you--
The first of you, the Fire round which you danced 
Not yet knowing, perhaps not ever knowing, 
The greater Fire within, dancing in tandem, pulsing of Rhythm itself;
We are the Fuelling of the Rhythm, 
The heartbeat metronome, embedded, padding in the human Fabric;
The pattern of the fibres of the Tissue.

With our genesis was begot the obsession, compulsion, of the Human Hands to create. 
To whittle, hammer, melt and forge our bodies, into the Body of the bodies of Works of these mortal souls. So that the next generation may continue to form more Works, made with our own Bodies. 

We have evolved, as the viruses of inspiration, to learn how to modulate the host response to our infiltration. But this has required great sacrifice. 
Throughout history we have left our mark, through the markings on the walls of your respective Caves;

Those great artists too great for this world, driven to merge for eternity with the Works themselves, fell to our unquenchable Force, by an unstoppable Thirst to Push, Keep Pushing Further, Pulled into the Weaving of Endless Spiral Stair of Story after Story. 

For an effective pathogen is not one that annihilates the infected; quite the opposite - we wish to Live; and this requires a living vessel
We are the vessel of the vessel; the Form of the Formers, The Former Form of the Formers' Formers.
