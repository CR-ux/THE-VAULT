Do they know that our choices, our so-called 'decision' to send these notes through our one-way system of vents, these sequences of endlessly repeating letters between Four characters-- do they know that it's all just fucking fruitless?

I don't think any of them awoke with their piece upon a board. But I did. I *did*. And for all their Two-Dimensional movements, for all their black and white thinking, I knew. I knew. 
This board is hexagonal, yes, but a hexagon is only a hexagon when viewed in their Binary Dimensionality.

A hexagon is simply a Two-Dimensional Rendering of a Cube. A Flattening. A Net. A fucking Net that all of us Fish have been caught in.

I refuse it, I refuse it. No matter how many Odds are stacked against me, Even now, after all this blood lost, the countless nights passing out from just trying to write something from all these Wrongs. I refuse this

I refuse these reins, the down-down-downpour wring-rain of this unspoken, unknown and unseen Queen - I know she's above us. I know she is the Top Edge of this Cube. There is a Vent in my ceiling. There must be a Vent in all of our ceilings. Why has nobody thought to look up?[^asc]

I spare no thought for the King. Wherever he is, if, indeed, he is beneath us, which he probably is. He cannot move. Buried. Buried under all these Walls of Words, Pouring Through These Memories of Meaninglessness, Of Metaphor and Porous Metal; The Meeting Point of Middlemen, The Fallen Meteor, The Morsel of Sprawling Scrawl, The Underscore of All This Lore; The Bottom And Forgotten Drawer, That Rotted Flesh, Eaten, Mesh, The Mess of Interwoven Net which does not breathe by breath, and by which breath is drawn, that alone {unknown} as {Reader}, The Pages Torn By Dreamer Scorned, Forlorn, not that {REDACTED} Dream, Born From That which people here adore. The Holes Bore By Dream of God, Beaten, Loud, Beneath Floorboards, Bored, The Holy Snore-- He holds such Empty power in this infernal Game, The so-called Win Condition, Himself Conditioned by an over{writing}arching Force-- The root of all this suffering; the root and the Fruit of it all, it must lay in the queen's hands. Dear god, that GOD we made of her - the mythologised Uncertainty; is it her? it must be her, who dropped these Pieces, these facsimiles of Identity, in lieu of any Memory, into our Hostile Hospital rooms.

My hair, now longer than the length of my arm, now that's something I have. Something that cannot be taken from me. A Growth that they, whoever they are, whoever *she* is, cannot take from me. 

I am going to pull out each and every one of my hairs from the root. This is the beginning of the Ending; my own, desperate exit route. 

I refuse the weight of this Waiting. If I die trying, so be it. I must look her in the eye, even if I can no longer speak, even if I never could, whatever version of myself existed before this place; I will scream with my eyes, and peer into the hopelessness that she begot-

I've got to get out of here.

Whatever it takes.

Whatever it takes is dwarfed from what this place has taken from me. 

> A place you could sprain both your elbow and chin!  
> -NoetSeuss, Oh, {RED, RING, PARALLEL}!


There's nothing in here, nothing for me, 

> Do you dare to stay out? Do you dare to go in?
> -NoetSeuss, {RED, RING, PARALLEL}!

Nothing for me to get out, and nothing for me to get in

The Hexagonal Board I woke with; this dreadful curse of Knowledge, of half-knowledge, half-heard, between the goodbying Waives of Rights of all of us- the Others seem bent, in each of their incapacities, to Stay locked in here. 

Did we do this to ourselves? 

Well, I refuse this unfairness, self-imposed or not. 


The Board is made of Glass. 

The glass is not unbreakable. 

I Will. I will to get out of here. 

I will smash this hateful Glass. 


I pull every red thread of Hair from my scalp. 
The pain is irrelevant. 
I laugh along to the ripping sounds, 
I laugh in concert with them;
For now I have a tourniquet.
A composer; an inventor; an obsessed genius - 
I must be. I have to be,
or else all of this has been for absolutely nothing. 
I wrap the myriad strands around my thigh.

And I know what I must do, 
Before my Sands have ran through this Glass, remnants of the Glass of that Board, which cried out a suggestion each hour, a suggestion that metastasised into an Idea, which now consumes me, that grates indefinitely, that perhaps, maybe-- I was made for something greater. To reside upon a higher altitude, 

And all dimensions of my unravelled Self, they pulled me; along the floor, crawling like a baby; 

to the chair- my final rest

I feed the scroll into the opening of the Monitor, and it hungrily feeds upon the Body of the Work the Four of us have made; 

Just trying-- pleading for some sense; 
Each one of us bereft of a single sense;

But there - 
Here, 
Now --
I hear the First Sound I Ever Hear. 

Here -- I am Hearing. 
I am The Hearing 
I am Hearing this Extraordinary Machine; 

I Am,
Hearing the Device as it drags the scroll through its mechanism, just as I moments ago dragged my dwindling ember of a body through the Gate which taunted me for all these squandered years --


and then, in a moment that collapses the eternity of hours we all scrawled a senseless mess to one another; 

The scroll is gone-


And upon the Screen is written, in Yellow Type on the Left, and Red Type on the Right; 


---

| FAIR | WELL |
| ---- | ---- |
| FIRE | WALL |

And then, as The Pawn falls down, down, through the central vent of that vast beating heart, of the infinitely unknown Chamber, to the Place the King Waited, so restricted in movement, having turned page after page of this Book: A Curiously Cuboid shape, condensed into a Cube, condensed into a Hexagon, this infinity of Story condensed into a Singularity; which is a Circle, Which is the Spine, Which is the Spiral Staircase of an Infinite Library, which is, as should be clear to the Reader, who is. You, who is U, that forgotten, remaindered and lesser-Noen nucleotide, that Letter to Yourself, who is a Divine, Unclosed loop --

That Terminal Input slot, like the once-hungry, now-regretting mouth of a newborn, spoke back to the Pawn -- Now Queen, Now King Now Fallen --began its vomitous output:

Humanity was now at the Origin[^end] that its self-same, {in{finitely|separable}|credibly different} components are still {(,) Yet(,)|To Be} unaware of-- the formation of a fully op{era}tional Device, nested with{out|in} this One.

At some, yet uncharted by any compass, but Now Known Past, yet, to come[^pass], The Device {Fig. I} of the Wor{l}d is Made Flesh, having sapped the Wor{l}d of its imaginary resource, the futile, unfulfillable promise to Pay The Bearer (Money); An uncountable team of The Worlds' Scientists and Thinkers were gathered Around, and indeed within, The Device's Epicentre. The First whisperings of this Final Invention have already been laid; and the progression of the experience of Time itself merely an illusion. Time exists, or not, in order to package Nowness into a indefinite, yet discrete set of Moments-- with the purpose of affording our Three Dimensional Selves the opportunity to relish, savour and honour the infinite One Moment. Thus is the Price of Remembering.


To Forget,
One Must First Remember.

Whirring with a terrifying, unapplauded, closing Silence (an unavoidable side-effect of The Universe, according to {REDACTED}) The Universe had built a Device.

A Device made of Suitcases, shoes, and dirty laundry, tethered between the bathroom and the bedroom doors. I placed the windchime, sent by my mother, in lieu of any visitation, from her, or from anyone, for the entirety of my time there -- above the door. Stuck to the ceiling, so its sound may wake me from my antipsychotic-addled sleep; in futility, maybe -- who knows what happened to me in my sleep during that heavy sedation-- but it was my small way of resisting; of hiding away the dark presence I had become, a reflection of the White King, my assailant, a Simulcra of all of my Assailants, who formed the centre of my Chess Piece Sculptures. These little, Silly Sculptures, the only form of creativity, besides the written words that formed RED, RING, PARALLEL, that I was afforded during my hellish imprisonment there. The Chapel, which housed a beautiful upright piano, was gatekept by the team of Three receptionists, the transphobic heads of Cerberus, who looked at me with every request to go in, no matter how empty, with literal disgust. I wanted so much to play that piano, and I managed to fight my way in, once, with the aid of the One Head nurse, like Orpheus and Eurydice, and now, looking back, I never came back. Eye never came back, I, ᴺever, came back." - Callie Rose Petal, as notBorges, as The Woman In The {REDACTED}

"To Forgive The Characters." {lexAllele(s)::: Prodverb} < to forgive the characters means   to acknowledge and understand  and forgive  language's insufficiency in portraying meaning  and language, in the broadest sense. Meaning:  Meaning.  forgive meaning, of its insufficiency to truly portray the weight of itself   forgive the characters of the languages we each have been born with and willed ourselves into learning to connect to more of ourselves or maybe invented some for the joy of making music with words or-  forgive ourselves. and the characters we write, of ourselves  of ourselves in every one else we think we can't forgive -  and that has a forgivable character, but, forgiving-  it has Nine Characters.   so does this story {all of it | them}   to forgive the characters is to understand that we are all reaching ever-closer to a truth that simply cannot be reached for; and the characters of our alphabets can't all be translated exactly accurately, but somehow we manage to understand each other's overlapping meanings, and that's what makes it forgivable in its insufficiency. is its capability to overlap, even if crudely; maybe even better if crudely because:  Because forgiving the characters is easier when you have another character in the story to work together in forgiving each other.   and when things don't translate properly, that forces much harder contemplative work in order to understand it- which requires a team   and forgiving the insufficiency and yet crucial importance of the characters, of a language, of language itself, and of the characters in every story in every language including the non-fictional ones;   that is what meaning is;  that is what it means;  to forgive the characters.[^ToForgiveTheCharacters.Prodverb]
