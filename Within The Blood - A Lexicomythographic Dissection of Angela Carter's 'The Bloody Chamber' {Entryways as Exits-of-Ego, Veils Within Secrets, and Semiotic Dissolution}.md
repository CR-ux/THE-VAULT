**Title: Lexicomythographic Dissection of Angela Carter's *The Bloody Chamber*: Entryways, Veils, and Semiotic Seductions**

**Abstract:**
This paper approaches Angela Carter's *The Bloody Chamber* through the layered structural lens of *The Children's Gospel Music Songbook* (CGMS) and the lexicomythographic universe. We {REDACT} a hexagonal cell of confession, transformation, and epistemic violence, whose lexDef is written in the blood of prior narratives.

**1. Introduction: Dictionary as Architecture**
In the lexicomythographic frame, the dictionary is not a catalog of words but a map of Entryways. These Entryways—like rooms in Borges' Library, or hexes in the CGMS—are not flat. They are recursive, {REDACTED}the first wound, the first door, the first utterance.

**2. The Chamber as Lexical Womb**
The titular "bloody chamber" is not just the site of marital horror, but a metonym for the lexDef of "woman" in patriarchal text—a defaced and overwritten definition, overwritten again. The room is a semiotic trap: it bleeds meaning, but only through violation. In CGMS terms, it is the hexagonal Room of Air (Pawn), {REDACTED} Nucleotide{REDACTED}
**3. Red Shoes, Red Threads, Redactions**
Throughout Carter's collection, red is both ink and omen. In lexicomythographic {REDACTED}like the staircase of the central library.

**4. {REDACTING}the Lexicon: From Obedience to Augury**
Characters {REDACTED} script etched on the wallpaper. A Notation becomes a Noise.

**5. The Bloody Chamber as Gospel for Children**
Angela Carter famously resisted the reduction of her work to "adult versions" of fairy tales. Instead, she sought to **reveal the meanings that were always already buried inside**—a mission precisely mirrored{REDACTED}. The child is the Witness. The gospel is {REDACTED} bleeding with meaning.

**N.B.**:[^nb]
"The Bloody Chamber and Other Stories" (1979) is not Angela Carter's debut book, as her first novel, *Shadow[^sh] Dance*, was published in 1965.

[^nb]: **Nota Bene.** From the Latin, *to note well.* But you didn’t, did you? You let it slide, like all the other brackets. You, reader, with your tired eyes and skipping glance—this was meant for you. N.B. is the flicker. The fail-safe. The knife between the boards. It is a jarring shift into **you**. Something is not write. Go back. Look again. There are multiple Entries. There is more than one wound.
