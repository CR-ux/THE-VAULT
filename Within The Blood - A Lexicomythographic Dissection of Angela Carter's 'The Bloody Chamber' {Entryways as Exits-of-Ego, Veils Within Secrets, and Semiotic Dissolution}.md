**Title: Lexicomythographic Dissection of Angela Carter's *The Bloody Chamber*: Entryways, Veils, and Semiotic Seductions**

**Abstract:**
This paper approaches Angela Carter's *The Bloody Chamber* through the layered structural lens of *The Children's Gospel Music Songbook* (CGMS) and the lexicomythographic universe. We investigate Carter's gothic feminist intertexts not merely as reinterpretations of fairy tales, but as dynamic Entries within a recursive dictionary of archetypal breach. Through close reading, semiotic enumeration, and structural mirroring, we propose that each Carter story operates as a CGMS chamber: a hexagonal cell of confession, transformation, and epistemic violence, whose lexDef is written in the blood of prior narratives.

**1. Introduction: Dictionary as Architecture**
In the lexicomythographic frame, the dictionary is not a catalog of words but a map of Entryways. These Entryways—like rooms in Borges' Library, or hexes in the CGMS—are not flat. They are recursive, echoic, and sacred. Carter's *The Bloody Chamber*, too, is not a linear text. It is a cathedral of perforated veils, each tale a confession booth that redacts, rewrites, or resurrects a silenced archetype. In this context, the term "Entry" is literal and symbolic: the first wound, the first door, the first utterance.

**2. The Chamber as Lexical Womb**
The titular "bloody chamber" is not just the site of marital horror, but a metonym for the lexDef of "woman" in patriarchal text—a defaced and overwritten definition, overwritten again. The room is a semiotic trap: it bleeds meaning, but only through violation. In CGMS terms, it is the hexagonal Room of Air (Pawn), where breath turns to scream, and name becomes cipher.

**3. Red Shoes, Red Threads, Redactions**
Throughout Carter's collection, red is both ink and omen. In lexicomythographic semiotics, red is the prodverbial highlight: a signal of narrative divergence. Like the loops of tape in CGMS, Carter’s motifs repeat—but degraded, altered. The red thread is Ariadne's, but also the bloodline of generational trauma. It spirals through each tale like the staircase of the central library.

**4. Rewilding the Lexicon: From Obedience to Augury**
Characters like the Tiger’s Bride and Puss-in-Boots enact a linguistic rebellion. They refuse their inherited syntax. They mutate genre, shatter punctuation, shift tense—prying open the lexicon from within. In CGMS, this is equivalent to a Subject escaping the script etched on the wallpaper. A Notation becomes a Noise.

**5. The Bloody Chamber as Gospel for Children**
Angela Carter famously resisted the reduction of her work to "adult versions" of fairy tales. Instead, she sought to **reveal the meanings that were always already buried inside**—a mission precisely mirrored by the lexicomythographic method. Like CGMS, which masquerades as a children's songbook while encoding recursive theological and philosophical paradox, Carter's collection performs an inversion: the child’s tale becomes a sacred Entry. The child is the Witness. The gospel is her scream.

In this light, *The Bloody Chamber* is not a perversion of innocence—it is the **preservation** of subtextual memory. The music is there, but it has been detuned.

**6. Conclusion: Toward a Lexical Theology**
Carter's work speaks fluently in the language of the lexicomyth: she understands that every fairy tale is a footnote to a wound. Within the universe of CGMS, her work is both glossary and gospel—an Entry disguised as entertainment. Her chambers are ours: looping, layered, bleeding with meaning.

[^nb]: **Nota Bene.** From the Latin, *to note well.* But you didn’t, did you? You let it slide, like all the other brackets. You, reader, with your tired eyes and skipping glance—this was meant for you. N.B. is the flicker. The fail-safe. The knife between the boards. It is a jarring shift into **you**. Something is not write. Go back. Look again. There are multiple Entries. There is more than one wound.
