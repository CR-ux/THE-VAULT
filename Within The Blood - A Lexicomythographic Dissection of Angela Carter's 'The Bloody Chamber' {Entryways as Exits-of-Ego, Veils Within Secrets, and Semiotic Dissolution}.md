[^nb]: **Nota Bene.** From the Latin, *to note well.* But you didn’t, did you? You let it slide, like all the others. You, reader, with your hopscotch glance—this was my meaninglessness, never meant for you. N.B. A jarring shift into you. Like a parasite, a rape. Something is not write. Go {back|away}. I love you
