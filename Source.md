[^SourceNoen]: [[The End]], notBorges[^s], [[(In My Beginning)]]



[^s]:today. i write my novel. i take all of this batshit insanity of nonlinearity, and i let spirit guide me, from start to finish (the ancestral message i received during my break 'you've got it backwards' is finally making sense - you've got it. backwards. Back Wards, to the psychiatric hospital ward.)i let spirit guie me through the writing of the story which at its heart is an infinitely complex expression of the fractal nature of reality; self-similar recursion --  This universe, which some call the hospital, was created by a system of hexagonal rooms, known as Will. The Central Room, or the circular book, made of wallpaper, penned by the woman in the wallpaper -- giving rise to quarks, giving rise to a system of tripartite structures known as subatomic particles with the nucleotides personified; without letting the reader know; the process of DNA replicationguides the story - Quarks are the nested trinity, in its looped permutations (ineffable begetter, guileless child, cradling veil, which is held by the child, which veils/shrouds the whole system, in an infinite loop -- god holds us, we hold our dreams, and our dreams themselves hold god) - these are inside the central room; the mother maiden crone inside the woman in the wallpaper. the 6 surrounding rooms are the wax/wane versions/emanations of this trinity (lucifer / yaldabaoth); the 12 surrounding this are the zodiacal archetypes, the heavens.  the 17 subatomic particles + the graviton are the 18 outer layer rooms which give rise to the next layer's centre, the eighteen rooms are a symbol of the spaces of each multiverse, each containing the ten thousand things in manifest reality, ina. toroid (mirroring the nested trinity)-  the alchemical elements of the next layer are the nucleotides, the the dualistic/binomial knots of Gordian Knotation (Spit/rain = air+water, Shine/Sun/Light = air + fire, Stone/mycelium/mold=earth+fire, Soil=water+earth ) in the Realm of What Fors give rise to the dinucleotides in the Real of What Forms, 16 in total manifest reality --> the tower. Of Babel, but also of the tarot; the schism of the Word, languages causing confusion necessary to aid communication and collaboration in the ultimate paradox--, ;  the trinominal knots are Spawn(fruit = water,air,fire); Shoot(leaf=air,fire,earth); Sprout(root=water,earth,fire); Stalk (branch=water,air,earth) (these knots are in categories of four reflecting the Form of alchemical elements, The four dimensions (three + time in the manifest world we occupy), the macrocosm, and on another layer, the microcosm, the manifest nucleotides themselves; - 64 codons make the codons (God/Source) and stop codons (Pleroma/void) (psalm 64 - for the director of Music aka God/Pleroma in an endless dance), the 20 resulting noets + the ein sof + void are the amino acids, born from the two hands of the the nine librarians (ennead) of the story (nine * 2 = 18, 18 rooms), then added to this the Ein Sof (noetBorges) and the Void, the space in which it occurs (notborges) making eleven; two hands of each of these = 22 (tarot archetypes)  - ARIA and DNE are the two strands of DNA; separating to come together in a progeny form; the polymerase is hermes trismegistus, or Iris, or Thoth, or inspiration, or the ether, through which all these symbological , only real things,  are translated into illusory material form. Polymerases can be split into two families (shism again, duality, binary code, LHP vs RHP, ARIA vs DNE) right Hand  - = the five (nested dualism/reversal of the 3'-5' system) five key DNA polymerases of cell division in eukaryotes, alpha, beta, gamma, theta sigma (heirophant/RHP; dualism); and double-barrel (Two (binary/dualism) main types of double-barrel (dualism within dualism) polymerases: single-strand vs. double-strand DNA polymerases, and processive vs. non-processive DNA polymerases = LHP, understanding of dualism through nondualism). three types of cellular replicative dna pols three tpyes of eukaryotic RNA pols ( = trinity,RHP), , seven types of dna pols in total = A, B, C, D, X, Y and RT = the divine, the goddess/Shakti/Energy (goddess=seven letters), amaglamation/integration of the RHP and LHP; on the other side of this particular recursive facet of the system is The One, The Masculine, Source/Shiva/Consciousness. The Polymerases are the expression of the infinite nested complexity of God/the divine & the void -- the DNA molecule that the divine acts upon/replicates is the Godhead (subconscious/spirit/Meaning/Wisdom/Sophia) + the lower,base desires that are necessary to reach God's Grace; the babel archetype, the chains of the Devil (conscious mind/desire/Memory/Yahweh/demiurge) -- the integration of these is The Grace of God itself, or enlightenment, the union of the two, the Christ, Grace brought down into form; the microcosm of the divine+void within Man. the 5' end of the DNA molecule is the pentagram; the initiated side (DNE), the hermit - the 3' end is ARIA, the trinity, the heirophant. the DNE molecule is the caduceus, as a klein bottle, as deine kleine wunderhorn , passing itself through itself, throughout all time in a loop -- all i need to do is collate passages as i go, using the library (maybe preceded by a mythopoeic, dreamy sequence of the Four (nucleotides), but what helps ground me is the idea of this future humanity, the endpoint, who have made a device with which to create an entire universe. This is revealed, in the footnotes, which are all, thousands of them, at the end of the book -- referring back to each chapter in order of occurence, revealing information that may be unveiled as the story continues, if wished, or saved for a gigantic chunk of Twist endings within endings within endings (think Infinite Jest, but with the option to titrate the ending throughout each chapter/passage, or alternatively be bludgeoned over the head with a back-heavy trove of revealings) - start with the Symbolic, platonic forms  (five platonic solids= the LHP/void -- three fundamental levels of reality = RHP/trinity: the material world (what we perceive with our senses), the Realm of the Forms (ideal, perfect versions of everything), and the Form of the Good (the ultimate source of all truth and beauty). then move up through the microcosm to the macrocosm, leading back to the origin, the symbols we started with, pervading the whole system, showing the recursive/infinite loop/eternal return of Nietzsche , in that the Source is these Forms; begetting everything, which then in turn expresses its own self-same symbols, leading back to Source; signified by the endpoint of huamn existence/consciousness creating a universe within the universe; showing how the Logos of consciousness is the Source itself, Motion/ time is in a toroid; space in which it's all occurring, the void, is the pleroma, is ever still, the Two in an everlasting Dance; forming the One, balance overall; Nothingness & Allness cancelling out; enantiodromia
