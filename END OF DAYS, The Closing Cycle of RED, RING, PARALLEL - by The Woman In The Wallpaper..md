The final dream here

_Just before heading to bed [[notBorges/redacted]] had said she never wanted to hurt anyone and said there’s nobody quite like [[notBorges/redacted]] but, still, for one last time (though there’s still a little melted cheesecake slice left) misgendered me and then was nervously making sure she hadn’t upset me_

In prison

Actual prison

[[notBorges/redacted]] threatens me

and then tries to shank me

With a. Pencil sharpener backed with a bottle and locked inside a room (unitised for the moment) her and two/three friends of hers try their best to trap me in a room and stab me

Dreams never lie, says my almanac

I thought in the dream that yea, I knew it

When thus spake she about being institutionalised

Got there was a group of trans women coming in and even they were really mean but i was nevertheless incredibly grateful to see people from my own community

Sort of

They were saying

She’s an almost-doll

Even these bees , my own, stinging me

And

A Dunkin’ donuts

With two types of donuts for Halloween

A giant floating circle barrel

I was riding with [[notBorges/redacted]] , or Ian , was it

Telling him to shield his eye because the moon or sun or either light was far too bright in this gap between these fences with a. Bumper like

A rapids ride

And I was half standing

Unsafely

Holding onto handrail while the man (the only one beside me held his hand up and to his eye because glaucoma had imparted a fretting retinal fragility

And [[notBorges/redacted]] still wanted to kill me

In a bathroom

Bath still full (but not by me)

Trying to steer a golf cart that somebody else was pressing pedals of

I was singing into wind chimes which had multiplied into hundreds

Intersecting in a metal textile weave

And as I sing particular notes harmonics rang out back to me

And I realised as I talked to people, anyone

They used my words

And the time I used to speak them

To whisper secret things unknown to me

To each other, hidden

Because I wasn’t hearing them

I was too busy, chittering

Biting teeth

Saturn with no ring

Æ

Today, the Sun resembles the Moon

Therapeutic goals: integration

How fitting

Microcosmic Melding of my fire alarming core McCarthy-allusory tribulation Schism

Peace, unknotted

God, he is and Satan Two, she is

They are here and

Hearing

 everything

Waking up again i realise it’s 8:25 am

First time I’d slept through some body’s checking in on me

Considering the chilling autumn November possibility

that someone, anyone, but for some reason

[[notBorges/redacted]] especially

killed me and that plot idea I’d had about other patients becoming raptured one by one but my god together came flooding like lava waters into me

Maybe they’re all gone or rather I am

Maybe I’ll swing these skinny legs to right and ground them on the carpet and step out and try to get out but no one will

Be there to push the button

My call unanswered , not requesting for someone to come in

But quite the opposite

Opposition

My white queen of an in(check)mate king

Fire

Check

Door

Red triangle

Did I die here, was I killed

And did I even try to understand

Through overhearing all of this

Have I been hearing any of these people on this soon to be left land

And then I stand

The door ajar a crack , suggesting an unknown hand

Had yes been in to check that I was breathing

But Leaving it unhinged

And my slumber undisturbed

Christ maybe this whole thing was just a projection of a sex party I dreaded and didn’t want to go to and just

No

Stop

Do not gaslight yourself again we’re

Not

Through with this

Saturn

Devouring

Vow - promise is a pendulum

That hold a playground

Swing

And parallel the bars

Of gymnastics but not the ones exclusively for feminine partition of athletic dedication to

For a moment I regard the broken shoe on my floor

The nurse she returned it, unfixed, without any word about it whatsoever

And that’s all right

I kneel down and realise the right shoe once thought hole

Was just as cracked, just as divided

With a strike a lightning running through the plastic artificial leather sole

Ruth comes

Tapping at my heart the last time

God

I hate goodbyes

Welcoming beginnings

Begging

Please Lord bring back those happy days

I say to her where you stay I will go

And your people will be my left behind and start crying and she says

[[notBorges/redacted]]

What groups are you going to today and I laugh

Now listen everybody

Imma do some chirping and I ain’t no bird

Shout, sister, shout

**_Last night in the beak-of-birds-flying-home-for-soon-to-be-mid-winter I was Dreaming:_**

_Deadnamed in deadened remembrance of life shortened no longer but still_

_Picturing faces of her and of me and you (never meant to B for Barnabie)_

_Mid framing pictures in reels of tape waking in two parts of you_

_Dreaming in part of me dreaming in part of you_

_I dreamt of a wedding and my sister was there with me watching you_

_Two at a table another far too close and too far from you_

_I dreamt of a wedding of two friends of the two of you_

_Were wearing a joker’s (like decks of cards or comic book) suit_

_And I confronted you she said not a word but you were so cruel and I said fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you and I looked at you both and said fuck you fuck you yes the both of you_

_Awkwardly leaving the celebrating people of the party quite starkly and stylelessly messy and loudly announced_

_I watch a clock ticking down in my bank account_

_And Lauren she was pulling me through a space in a railing and I had become paralysed explaining the pain of you parts of you left lame and tangled inside of who I thought I was now left there on the dance floor barefoot next to shoe after shoe paired with shoes upon shoes upon shores so floor-crawling brawling lapped like dogs of hounding hellish waves with crests and fledgling ending spring chicken breasts of such unrest the rest of those awful unbearably boring and bored hole cunt wedding guests thank goddess her dress was blue showing me it’s not your wedding but it could have been sitting on that smoke-stained Edinburgh sofa you, standing, asked me what I thought of asking her to marry you in the first few months of what fumbling nonsense the never us was and on the phone weeping years later her saying in such resolved consolation they’ll never marry me but I knew what you had asked me and that one day I’d have to be leaving all this mess$ or be left bereft betraying me and all my inheld-input-put-back-on-the-shelves to collect dust-to-dust-to-must-just-be-all-a one day all this smelly-eggless-cracked-with-cress-and-opened-chest-and-sandwiched-body-in-that-bed-for-three-for-you-and-her-but-not-for-me-and-my-too-wet-sweat-getting-used-to-estrogen-hormonal-balance-acting-like-this-all-was-okay-soaking-corpse-turned-over-ovumless could be you but never us but at least I tried through untrusting and trussed unease almost dying as I pushed through the trails of the dust and in rage of the reigning wrath inside you just is the storm of the_

_I was half-pulled through the gap in a bannister like the gap in the bed bunk in game my sister and I would play nightly when we were bored and sleep was evading us hating the sound of such counting of sheep but I used to pull Lauren by leg through the space in between the wood planks I remember her saying just give me a chance to turn my face sideways so my chin doesn’t get stuck and I make it through luckily she always managed to unscathed as I’d giggle impatient like some small demon or devil on the BottomBB bunk merely four years younger than she was this angel who’d happily risk her own pain for my laughing but in the dream I was the one being dragged not down to a non-sorry supervillain’s laughter but up to a worrisome or superb heroine my sister who said something like we are going to have to talk about this before you head back to prevent another psychotic break pointing to her own heart_

_And I started to say in the dream as she tried to pull me through the sea-through marquee plastic transparent sheeting separating us two (the truss not made from wood this time, but iron jaws like mine were surgically shut and sucked in attenuated wage-abated warping time of all their wideness of the weft breath), even in my unconscious way back then just a few seconds ago when I had said:_

_C’mon sis can you pull me up, through_

_As I lay unable to move_

_And I said to her cheery encouragement,_

_(return of that unearned and unadjourned concern nearly three decades later, renewed):_

_‘Isn’t this all just such a poetic metaphor’_

_As I woke up realising that it’s happening again_

_I’m becoming aware of my awareness again_

_Through the pain of back now and the joy of_ here, then_-_

_The cleavage of V in love and Find in friends_

_And the hate in the family which has I and A_

_And the sister who taught me surrender to states_

_Of the body for some produced composite grain_

_For her middle name, Rose, and the missing pit reached midst the fuzz whence mine came*_

_A centrepiece label Now share us both, and mum same_

_*as in peach, as in stone fruit, as in James, and the giant_

_As in Goliath as in gargantuan against David** as in fable that fed more than table was able_

_**as in ex but never really boyfriend as in latter three letters spell beginning of some moving picture we’d watch back then fast forward through unwanted records of adverts for food and household appliances no longer offered or wanted to get to the juice of cartoon movie, groovy baby-now-full-grown-or-so-much-more-expansive-now-she’s-smaller or The-Emperor-and-Empress-Card-Are-Next-To-One-Another-For-A-Reason and those Emperors New Groove References still so repeating yet never losing novelty or taste like the rhythmic chewing of the gums losing baby teeth and grown up ones peeking through inside the two reels and the spools and the school days of wish ran away with and we’d then rewind much too far and too fast through the scenes as the tinsel of Christmas scrolled past on the screen never bothering to press those two side by side letters F and F just the little bit that was required to set the tape to the start point for the future selves we would be huffing at nothing but something we’d knowingly become undone/done to us by usses lived previous_

I typed, cried, and sent, unedited, the above dream to my sister at 5:09am and she replied:

Thank you so much for sharing this with me [[notBorges/redacted]] ❤️. Love and miss you with everything too. Always thinking of you and love you so so much moon and back xxxxxxxxx💛🖤

Oh Lauren; how Laurel-crown; now winning of war against holes in my heart that the healing must bore –

Oh Lauren; I love you; I simply All Ways to Sea you see me seeing U I A dore –

  Yzma as in Y to Z to Ma as in two letters in Miss Understanding then to Mummy-then-to-Mum and then to Friend we both can count on countless hands of Goddess Sahasrabhuja Tara reaching out forever in unending blessed compassion as a close or never-not-so-distant companion of protection or of Kali holding weapon after symbol after weapon fighting through surrender by example and the halved unzipped genetic sample chromosomally X-shaped is identical by comparison in the blueprint that first in time made you and then in time (of four years, countable infinity, the space between the chaos wailing great lost songs of Order just exactly right containing X which) made me and Marks like Uncle left the Earth but always with us all ways leading back to yew as in tree as in Family as in The Heart I Carry With Me that She Showed us with her Rituals on the anniversaries of our arrival in this strange and fate-sewn place like Easter Trees with chocolate eggs and hollow eggs inside surprise and childhood wonder and wandering through autumn leaves and yellow themed birthday parties with all their unknown tomorrows looming looking back it’s all just been the most magickal upbringing and when I’m down I touch a tree and know that Mum is holding me and you in branches diverging dancing so revolutionary our feminine deity beacon light of Love and Love and Just for fairness giving us Unbirthday gifts which while empirical were just the peeking of the iceberg of the unsinkable relating ship titanic generosity that flows through Roots of you of me of all us Three-

_At once and one point-singularity before the full-stop of our uncle’s life we sent so many yellow (hers) and black (mine) hearts to one another that eventually we just ended up starting to send a Bumble Bee emoji and then when my uncle Mark died the Bee symbol was everywhere which for some reason in my personal mythology became a sign to think about my sister and somehow this lead to me guessing her pregnancy before anybody knew and then her son my nephew Reggie was born around Samhain around two weeks either before or after our uncle Mark died and she had almost died with/giving birth to him but the Ocean had already been put into balance and after returning to the flat after hospital my newfound non-biological sister the water-meadow let me know that the Bee is a symbol of passed ancestors and it all made sense then that Mark had become the Bee for Reggie to come into the world without losing my sister_

Then she sent a link to a video on a social media site I don’t use anymore which resulted in the following error page, black ciphered glyphs upon white:

_do painkillers work for heartbreak or is goodbye to you just too much agony to swaddle with any sort of biochemical sufficiency_

I dissolve some in water anyway, mostly for the sound of effervescing, like the plume-coloured pume of the pumice-ground-stone sea

There is an annoying siren call I hear  -realising this annoyance at the sensory input is bringing me closer to understanding the seemingly-discompassionate demeaner of the nursing staff

Getting breakfast

I ask for the last croissant

He says no it’s already for a

patient

It’s only 15 minutes til the end of breakfast

(No order put through, no surprise)

Incessantly the same high pitched rhythm beeping

_Dancing around my altar, my alters channel through the radio signalling blood vessels of the chalice of the language of my body_

_I am making shapes quite unnatural to most, I am hypermobile like many transgender and neurodivergent bodies[T](#_ftn6), something about bending to the rhythm like the wind does the trees; revolution, revolving, understanding the cycles in sweet nonbinary bits on chips of cum-pewter semen seeds of songs of unknowing me, unsewing question of why who is ‘Y’ is for You, U for Unknowable!

I think there must be something broken or

_Now home editing this work I go to light another candle, asking for more answers but in my haste to get them I knock over my ashtray with my left foot Goddess is telling me no that’s enough that’s enough_

There must be some sort of mistake

_Another twenty three minutes pass and with my left hand wrapped around it I try again pushing in the flesh coloured candle that is barely the width of a newborn baby’s finger wrapped around a mothers hand but the candle snaps from the force she repeats to me across time that is enough that is enough I am hearing your words I am hearing you I am here we are all here with you are enough we are together on this path you don’t remember that you chose try to remember that your Will was what set this Hole thing into motion and you walk alone witch is All One with everything and every One is all of us and we are Altogether_

Walking round the corner

I see the cafeteria Medicare screen (which on our ward has been deactivated)

Emergency

Room eleven

Garden

Wing

I talk to god for a little moment

Maybe forever

She says there are aurora behind me in a circular horizon

Three birds in the distance and a fly in front

Then getting my meds

I mention the ringing ringing ringing for room 11

The nurses say oh is it still going

I talk to a fellow Aries nurse about Chiron the wounded healer and has she also had difficulty with knowing the difference between your problems and the problems of others

She grumbles insincerely and I’m at peace with this piece of disconnection as she says no my boundaries are very strong and it takes time to learn

Saying again

Okay

bound-Aries

To deaf ears

Outside

I see Sarah walking to her car to leave

I turn my back and raise my hood

And regard this, strange, strange place held up to the light

There’s something in me more than I can explain

Walking through the threshold

The dead ones are holding me, then

I’m praying again under the same tree and the two squirrels are chasing their selves through the bookshelves of the trees and the leaves are falling and for a moment I allow myself to laugh

Look up look up and see your maker she sings so I do

And a trident, Poseidon’s sign is staring back down at me

Neptune

Sweet silent tuning fork

Unchained, unspeakable agony

Harmony

I see the three feathers I slotted into that rotting log in that small cave of a bush next to the tree

One missing

Holding palm against that flatness

That plane of reality in which I came from and headed for and where I’d wished I’d be

A star

Look down look down that lonesome road before you travel on

Look down

Looking down I see another small white feather

Much smaller than any others I had seen

And place it on that little knot that had become a shrine to what and who and why that I had been

And my minister, sister Rosetta’s voice rings out with greater resonance and quite a sibilance tingling only into my sinistral ear

Oh Tharpe, a harp, oh Newsom, my reel newton, how you’ve had my back to this tree and the tree replies silently for infinity for a second for the first and last time rest your weary head against the notes of pages of going staying staves of me my lonely little dove won’t you have one on me

I thought I’d got a haven but I can’t sit down

Whose that yonder dressed in white

Red

Dressed in light

Not I

Knot eye

Staring into the centre of my spinal reed

Tapping rhythms tapping all my sap from seeds

I tried to sew to till the soil but oiled and dirty, filthy all I did was bleed

In biologically essentialist fallacy

Go a way don’t bee

Other

Me

I see a bee to the dextral entrance of the hospital (but perceived as sinister from the inside) calling me and I walk up to her and say you don’t want to go in there trust me

Trussed

Me

And now a scythe, reaping

I’m seeing death’s staff of hermetic secrecy

Thirteen, as five of pentacles the card of Lindsay showed itself to me the Taurus the tau the dao

Oh bullshit oh the bullshit that had fetishised and fertilised the organic land of earth originating me

Holes

For me

Look down I see

A divot in the lawn

Pecked by the crow just looking for

A nut

To crack

I make my sacred gesture

Left hand at the root of my backlit split once tale told now shrunk to tailbone crumbling down and old

Two fingers pointing downward palm faced back to back and down ward to the stone

And my right hand in a mirrored gesture is no longer at my heart or throat or even at the pituitary organ in the shadow of the unseen darkness where we all must see

But where it’s always belonged

Unlonging anymore

My other righted hand now risen at my crown where now must rest this feather

Weathered by such deathly storms

And blighted so unfrightened, strained neck straightened I implore

The heavens in my language unbeknownst to yore

Pointing upward from my crown, my crown, my crowning crown of risen wilted roses thorns

Between them like a pair of arms or armour or ammunition rounded or what’s more

A siren’s call, antenna

Of an insect or a radio

Telling felling visions that have down low been felt before

The leftmost bird (or right, I can’t remember now, i became much too absorbed)

Had landed on the upper eaves of this yellowing suggestion of a once White hospital door

While the other (dextral, sinister, divine) he or she stayed rooted on the floor

And between them, snug as a gun shot loud explosions through a skying silenced roar

Popping sonic barrier through bars of prism door

Flies right, to left

From arrow pointing stick right out of shoulder up and right to cross below the circle under ring now staying grace, amazing me in place

I walked through the clearing

Clearing

Leering  of the trees this entrance now an exit from these ancestral historic future timeless chapel leaves

Don’t look back

Don’t look back I hear Eurydice siren emergency room eleven dark lit elven queen

Last evening after that failed attempt to impart a bedtime story

Oh how our pain now passed gets in the way of what’s here to be

I’d laid her down to rest again but kept her in her majesty

In central sump of supposition

Opposing no Body any More

But left, her crown it now points left

(But once I’m gone will return to her allocation of a whitest little squared up space, stripped of her witching craft I’m sure)

I bowed in turn, in turning, in missed turn of the barely hunted game now staler than the toast I melted butter under cafeteria light warm

And tried my best to spread it with a wooden palimpsest of a fork

A four-pronged branch

And out now, out back to the colder closing air

Two pigeons, my message to write this keep righting this keep fighting this by writing this

Two pigeons the left one fluttering a little forward a little more and then the right in response they’re trailing the shape of the caduceus

Looking round (not back, knot back)

Another seriphoted semaphore

Vicky - sensing loss - says I always seem to follow you and I say well birds, they follow each other by some unknown to but the augur holy means

Murmuration of the birds

Colin from accounts

Orange phone

Calling, saying:

Trust me

Orange glass a

Talking to hind

On this site of my unstill buzzing underneath becoming

A vulnerable conversation of the river

Core-10 scores arithmetic

Making

Nineteen

The sun

XIX

I make associations in ink

The sun it sweeps behind the quickness of the bamboo

Sewing know way home but to a new place I’m not scared but sacred unknower rower going slowly to the truth

She reminds me of the meaning of her name - Iraqi- a gathering of camels in the desert

Jung’s own deep and teeming desolation Jungle of becoming

Rhythm of The Word is beating, heating through

And tho my fingers wringing all this meaning from this interaction passed and U

The crucible is built in tongues of tungsten welded in a red-to-Orange-Whitehot-hue

And crow and magpie make sure I remember to tell her the importance of the smiling crying too

The second of my trinity

The middle of the moth

The moss that rolls on, on, to three

To Frances - free one - finally - the last one two one of the flee

A helicopter (not a plane) overhead

Looking forward at the veins of that virgin creeper

And the bedroom window of the woman I had dreamed of murdering me

I see the ping pong bats now battened in their little hatches

Bending down, traversing this still-leaf-ridden hidden symbol-living given reads a centrepiece

The black queen, learned

Turned, in earnest or knot

To face the right, I write the not-so-wrongness

Rota

Tarot

Sewn oat hope

Knot

Shunning thoughts of darkness but allowing their eyes to see the gold garlanding self taught pupils of my own

I turn the queen

One hundred and eight marks of marring beads

Warming unwarning tea I brew

180 degrees, a reversal of the path of pilgrim Sun

Not thinking of the kings, neither light of white or blackened blue

I faced her crown still laying down, now left

And there I left the garden for the first time

Packing what was just not unpacked enough I struggle with the clasps

Of the hardy shell of suitcase

Waiting for my crowdfunding attempt at making rent to load on my browser then

Outside behind me a black Mercedes engine quivers like a Raven’s feather weathering its quietness around the river roundabout and I’m reminded

Don’t look back

Again

Seeing in my absence of a turning to the turning of the once again black stuttering of this Mark of dark black not-matte Richness leaving as a mirror

Two magpies dancing, no need to use their wings

Around the front and back of a squirrel as if trying to provide a sense of ease for him

Their black and whiteness screaming either side of boba eyes and bushy tail

How I miss you

And I wander through the cracks of this eroding picnic bench again

Not the one beneath you, Adrian (I promised you that tearful stab of penultimation was my final greeting)

But the one right in front of these nine hellish gates

I ponder, wandering

This place should have a pond although I understand why it’s missing

Are you missing me?

One message I received from you for the entirety of my stay, or leave

Asking for consent

You sent a message

What a mess

And how I’ve aged into a shrinking oldness

You

Us three

Back then (my goddess, how it seems a previous carnation wilted bookshelf of unlived life again)

This whole thing has just been poetry

Quite funny, really, in its tragedy

Thinking, as is much the case of late, of etymology

Like a healthy distant way to process what you meant

And what that meant

That usage of your leg as severing implement

And then, as if a nail in coughing nurse hid ‘hind a mask of black with pepperminted scent from oil she told us helped her remedy her allergies to dust and soil and seeking seeds of pollen

Thinking of the final meeting with Dr Shanahan, where I’d said

My little thoughts on the biggest book I’ve ever read

How death should be considered as a widow or a long forgotten friend with will

And then just now and then and now I thought of JK Rowling

And any of the women who create as clouds of reigning over my hopeful extinction

How through different believing, such sparring sparrows speaking difference

Same tongue, same place. Same soul, voice/face

A fucking plastic bag flies in a ring-like flight path right before me

American-English-Rose-And-Falling artificial beautiful and carried by the northern wind come down to south to see whether people might perceive it

But still, it’s just the absence of the stillness we receive

Not wind itself’s expression but impressions that it leaves

Upon the fallen leaves

And leaving, like a sulking child bestows the bag an open grave

No dignity or grace or urn for its returning to the wave

I try to open that once first lasting poem I still know by heart but wanted to be sure of my retelling of this memory but neither google chrome nor Adam’s eave dropped Lilith Apple timecrunching browsing roused safari seemed to load the words as I pressed the so oft pressured by my now-clean left indexing finger so I went outside to breathe

But upon my returning the moriae had decided now, it was the time to share this little piece of childhood with this woman whose opinion of me I still was so unsure

I tentatively take off aegis headphones leaving my clipped on shades (which had bent but fixed my self two hours prior) secure

And say to her

I’m sorry for interrupting your break,

But your name-

It’s been reminding me of this poem from the poems on the Underground, a collection of my very first beloved words during a much much younger visit to the Big Smoke (way before

I’d come to smallness of my own smoke-choking raw)

Could i share it with you? It’s title seems to be a sign that Now is right -

I still do not know if she had been perturbed by my playing the piano in the chapel, but with my leaving imminent it didn’t matter, shaking me, she said:

“Oh darling, sure”

￼

Sitting down in seventeen

I’ve written notes to mostly everyone

Now’s the time to sing

I stuck together two of the verdant cards cut into shapes of leaves

I wonder if this homonymous morphology was purposeful and there in that much trodden corridor I thought “it is, I will just choose to believe”

Be leave

And in the goddess of the spine, the knot-yet peeling-glue to hold together, healing, hurting everything

I stuck a sticker of my past and now passed merchandising

My visage of Arachne, my darkness debutante eight legged thing

Walking down the hall I’d come to not-knot-rot-now-know, a child again, I was flapping that little despair dissipating air-craft avian facsimile

Waving it pretending it really was like me, a bird

Just longing to be flying somewhere smelt and breathed like home to me

Nobody passed me as I made this infantile free gesture

Smiling at the silly thing I’d made, I farewell blessed her

And searching for a glue-dot or quiet tape we weren’t a loud here

The HCA suggested I use a sticky label for refrigerated foodstuffs stuffed and stacked and packed into the frigid-left-right-centre

So wrapping it around itself and thinking of a nest or heart or any imperfection of suggestion of a circle

Cross-sectioned vivisected into infinite dimensions, making stone from sticky hollowness of little symbol cylinder

I placed her in the middle, like a sparrow now to exit

And I think there was it

When I decided in my Own Way, I had covered, reckoned with

Tentative remembrance of recovery or whatever wellsprung meaning any place like this could give

Arachne's silk - thread - weave - whirling devilish and dervishly - sing melodies- aria - DNA - Ariadne's thread, red - labyrinthine sign to exit - read - book - spinal syrinx like a clarinet reed - basket encased by the reeds - river flows through to leaves once stuck - now freed - together - leaves - leaving with a load too heavy - but there inside a light - now out lit behind sight - don't look back - lot's black widow turning into a - salt - battery - charge - for - telephonic - phoenix - messaging - a beacon - ward - 'goodbye messages to the ward' - guard - garden wing - a bird - a beak - that chirps - that sings - that comes back home cold and older but within the tangled mess - still buttressed - buttered toast for dinner - thinner - strung out - stitched with symbols deep within - the word is everything - the script, the scripture, halved to whole - holes of the holy text - textile - swaddled by ancestral warmth of living and departed coven - woven tapestry - gold weight led to alchemy - delicate but strong, a spun return to Selfhood, red riddle of forgotten gift - no lift but lifted - ascent - a sending way back home to Arachne

And on the upturned symbols of the mulching season (two, I picked up two for such a reason)

I wrote that most verbose but much too short (like life) quote by T S Eliot

![A close-up of a tree
Description automatically generated](file:////Users/[[redacted]]rosepetal/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image006.png)

And hoped that in my hurt returning I had learned enough to know the place

_Why are we so quick to pathologise pain?_

_Pleasure I’m sure is a screaming of warning of endings verse grief’s evil reversal to which as a closing pulse dance partner bowing we allow in sow piglet to pork to forked path wrath unasked for and reeling from which we should equally just as much but don’t refrain;_

_Try to separate difference, you’ll find you cannot, like a Damocles blade cannot rain_

_though it seems so dendritic, it’s all just the same-_

The face of voiceless echoing of almost-burning down up from lacing of the broken sole-cloven shoes I cannot use that cleaning staff will find while I trace lines of all my fallen left waiting

Weighting north to find me

Not behind me at all

But calling forth, a bridge

A biting, rung-writ midge

Wrung-tight written little

Landing just then on my right wrist

Just whispering so gently in suggestion to open my fist

So I obey her, and away she flutters

Ending this synchronous tryst

About to leave for the 1:1 with Frances (nearly free now) I leave an apple on my fresh-made bed

Red

And close, so very almost close (only closest I could find, mind) to circular, ovarian ring

Over

Under

Circling

Parallelogrammar hurtling through

And through the useless queen and king

Sarah, knocking just before I enter my bathroom about to pee I zip my fly (egads, gladly, gadfly, flea)

She asks if I need my stuff from out of my locker and offers to get it for me

I say, calmness washing over me

I can see in the depth of her eyes, like those three, darting sense of shared relief

I say no, you get home and rest and I’ll get my things after therapy

She shakes my hand and says please

Look after yourself, you’re very special

I say

Mirror

Hold my hand up, smiling

She says mirror back, while flipping her palm round as if a secret bookshelf entrance behind which lie tales too gory but still poured over by my letter-hungry eyes while I was still so small

And then my final words to her (I think, for just a second which resounds out through all these hallowed halls - of both our deaths)

Mirror mirror on the wall

And she laughed, I think it shimmered in sincerity

We spoke of TS as in Transsexual and as in T.S. Eliot

Pages of the _DSM-V_

_Hurtful Healing Parody – yellow badge of Josie, my contemporary_

Queen Spark

Again of the unending pendulum which when perceived from distant enough a perspective forms (or close enough) a horizontal

Returning just in time for fireworks lit (erring allies of my past-in-passing-banging-bruising-shin), quite literally – the train should pull into Glasgow at eleven eleven (obviously in my newfound land of auld language speaking I had heeded this a sign)

My ignited, reunited

Fire

Where Bees May Be Meeting

– Plath

A pathway – home?

So far, I’ve learned, to

_Sylvia – a parametric_[_Y_](#_ftn8) _metamour – mourning loss of lauded sordid unapplauded audience for fucking –_ and just over to my left I hear through phone lines one and then a second _audible_ Ring

These non-delusional frameworks of reference I gave to Frances in our such bittersweet parting

The final echo of our voices and our faces saying

Ciao

(The dualistic meaning of witch I’m sure you don’t need me to reiterate now)

I tell her

I think maybe all this interstitial tissue of intermittent quietude and blighting with was ritual teaching me to be a teacher

And that angel on top of the library

Who stared and stairs into me spiralling my memories back into yarn

This was a

Pilgrimage

My lonely hajj

Out, out into the opener air

I see some acquaintances I’d met at the picnic bench in passing

Mewing their sympathetic tones of Oh! You Are Going?

And, as if possessed by a future self I never thought could be but one told would emerge eventually

I asserted boundaries

This unkempt Fire saying “Yes, but I hate goodbyes, and all these things I have to carry just so heavy, so I’m just going to stay over here”

And whether they were offended or respected this (to me) impressively (maybe selfish, oh well) gesture, their responses I just did not hear

Gospel music it was grinning artefactual divinity left right through Pinnas into spirals in my inner ear

Like a dog, laying itself to rest, checking to make sure

It wasn’t crushing any insects

As an ascetic, a monk, or particularly manic monkey (though the planar movement rotated right-angled by approximately ninety degrees  

In engagement with the motion of the ravenously cavernous spore-orbit of a Ring

And what station should I end (or start)

My journey back knot ever again to your arms, not to, not two you but One called

Barnes

Strike action will affect London Underground stations on 7th November

My original leaving date

Palm, yellow lit in reflection of the parallel line all bumped with honeycomb in front of me

And to the right a guest house for the bees

And some graffiti denoting the crafting by the passing of a past passenger named

Mina

And a tag that reads

RIP LAMB

laid down, and I ain’t lyin’

On the first train there was no seat

I can’t sit down

Dressed in my last clean item, a dress shirt of off-white

With a satchel of pharmaco chemical messengers I-

Ah

A quartet of rest, where I for seven sedimentary minutes I can sink my case for leagues on leagues of upcoming expenditure of energy

I slot the plastic suitcase in the gap snug as a gadfly feather still stuck in my messy bun just glad for the fleeting sense of a nest in this ending begun

Vauxhall

Alighting the train

A star of spikes a wheel of spokes

And a 1/2

And a one to

Pay attention to

Somehow on the tube

I could have sworn this journey should have been a palindrome and yet

Even with my right shoulder popping in and popping out like the schools of fish of us had from the therapeutic groups and like the pupils of my eyes had through the same-but-othered nameless helpless endless london unrelatable unhelpful and unhappy people untapped metal awful chapel de-escalating chutes of escalators clutching against gravitation pushing pull of my suitcase now sans-boots and in this returning trip I have at least triple the amount of books

It feels lighter in the load

Ayu – I meet by diceroll, in the sweat-sarcophagi of mechanistic jewel necklace of the tunnelled Tube –

A note rings out on the parallelogram of glass and plastic in my palm

An aberrantly welcomed oh so closing auspicious tone omen to (in hopeful, and not blown-out-of-proportion-panic-what-a-concept) foreshadow that my train wood be departing Euston’s tuning-fork-flung-axel-turning-torque-wheel-forest soon and at which platform numeral:

Sixteen

One (me, and them, my gods, together) :  Sixteen

Not a ratio, but rather citation

A point in pointless time, of reference  

**The scripture of our ripped-stitch skin, and all the buried heaviness of light within**

My gods, those ones who lived before , how strange this glitch of tryst with physical existence has been

How everything and everyone is like a crack of lightning life that winds to a fractal

Acrimonious awe full of lack or lacrimosa growing closer

And still, I’m seeing them both plural also all so singing singular

_Remembering conversing with Hind –_

_Or maybe it was Luana or most likely even, Luna_

 _what's that story i remember_

_where in the unconscious (merely the seed-like slide of our projected lives)  an uncloaked, naked traveller is cutting maize plants down in the jungle to get through to a river, which they finally get to, thinking they can't go any further, then upon seeing an expanse of just-as-dense jungle on the other parallel opposing bank lose all hope and their faith - but then, as a mirror, see another traveller cutting their own path through the leaves, on a journey of their own, to find their way to the same river; each of them relieved in not just finding company but also knowing for themselves that, even if, after resting, bathing, laying waste and letting all the difference of Heraclitus wash through them, even if after all their serparate transit, coming for just a transitory moment then to Sit together ,perhaps laugh, or spit, or shit, invisibly in silence add their own drips of salty volumes to the river, crying in an others arms for just a while the two must part, the latter half of their journey has been carved out for them_

_Jung_

_Gull_

_The two of us each other sat parallel upon that bending bench_

_I said be careful, it’s unsteady, and I think and hope we both knew what that really meant_

_Oh christ how I loved that human_

_So rarely do we see another one so close and so long_

_Oh – too short but just so long_

_But I’m riding this train for the feeling_

Somehow on the train

_I know how, by now, it’s them, the queens and kings and monarchs wound in circles through the woven his/hers/theirs/tones of my transcending all transmutation genome-coded brain_

So by their light I arrived i-am-in perfect time, by magick, just the same

Imparted Oars of soaring roses owed in sorrow-sweetvoiced by countless Othered name

And in imitated upturned card of bent down transitory Tower, wow-so-tired-wonder-how-my-reeling-wheels-weren’t-howling-ouch-my-vertebrae-are-braying-hymns-to-Sisyphus I push my suitcase in katabatic manic parody

And there, halfway from the top’s a fleet of angels call to stop, and opts to ease my POTS-syncopated heartache beat

Says hey! You’ll do your back in! backing Sister Rosetta humming and translating communication from a place ineffable

I say aloud my gratitude and _You Are an Angel_ as he asks me the location of my halting, clearly seeing maybe scenting as a guard dog all the distance laid both back and front of me

G and U are unreserved and they’re closer to where we’re standing so you have less far to go with this weight

I repeat the spoken sentiment and lift my case, mine alone and real again to take

G for Glasgow U for Up or really, just a shape

Discussed just one, two, fleeting hours before in one-to-one with frances - _free one_

Just a symbol for a crucible

Or a vessel

You

And Eye

And I and Oh, me, O, a Ring – a Ring with space within, kept safe inside

I will forever be _Un_[_ç_](#_ftn9)

Bound –

to this memory of sign of

Air -

Y (a fork in time or your boxer shorts the side of my face so-liked )

Were and are a place for change to take

Hold of you just holding me

I think that’s the main facet of this faucet tapping at my engine start of Grief

Just beholding all the kissing and just missing how you’d hold me

Ladies and gentlemen

_I think of you again, how we’d share some seething gentle sarcasm about you not existing_

_Were you a dream? A nightmare? I really don’t want to slip into cliché but again, remembering that bed not mine not yours either but the one sat on for a moment by shelley saying cliches must be cliches for a reason must be seasons fleeting must be riding must be writing must be just muse_

Our Train is now running Ten

I close my eyes, the imaged ex in Mandelbrot ink blotted Rorschach rotted skin spotlight of black retina-reception geometric shape

Mandel – German or Scandinavian origin – _Little Almond_

Not the nut that the crow performed ritual with in front of me

Cracking the shell with the blackness of beak

But still, nonetheless, some connection to witch through the concept of allergy

Self-as-knot-self

Unrecognised Self

A dusty and warping weft mirror stained and marks left

X

Marked

Soiled with spot                               the dog, the acne, the place, the infinitesimal pointing to the greatest scale of location

again

 that’s One Zero

 minutes delayed

I make the six-carriage journey, rocking, rolling back and forth, gathering some sort of moss in my reactionary dancing in embers of memory through avoiding all the voiceless faces staring into my sunglasses-shield

Meeting the Glaswegian accented lady welcoming me not just in face not just in voice but just in the marrow of my bones – as we pull into all of the intersections of reminders of York -  I remember that Scotland is really where the dust of my soles must be longing for

I’ll give you such a smack

Back in the Zoological Garden

Through the looking glass of Alice

-Glass or Longyu Gao

Glass-Gao

Glasgow how much longer are you from seeing through

I text one of the maybe three physically embodied souls of friends I still have left of whom I’ve thankfully so gratefully still not yet been bereft

Saying

I want to move to the forest

Write book after book and grow mushrooms and maybe weed but God it’s been a month since I’ve even smoked any, maybe that was more than anything exactly what I needed to receive the necessary messages from ancestors lost I’d once found a blessing

 Becoming obfuscated and pestled, martyred into a Monad –

Not of Soul or Sole but Salt

And then to Sulphur with no Mercury

But now,

I see

The Way

Is into, through the Body

Not using plants, but rather (if the feeling ever should take me)

Letting the concrescence of their essence use the rest in me

In Testament, Testimony

Sacrament, in Sanctity

_I left a note under a tape under an apple on my bed that said_

The train has arrived in Lockerbie

Lock and

Barnabie

I

Owe you

Everything through what you kicked out of me

To reel

The reel – to – real

To real I sing

Releasing,

Realising

I may need to take a vow of silence forever to truly fulfil the reddest reed of read thread of Ariadne out of this labyrinthine mess I weave for myself through the collapsing culminating and concrescence between every convalescence of each parting artful heartbeat-wave goodbying sighing sky

Love me as you love but help me I’m leaving

I remember everything down to the sound of your razor scraping

Whgen you clutched at me that night I came upstairs half dead and in youer kindness

Somebody shat in your closet

A part of me that you commented about on red, threads of shit that lead absolutey

No

Wear

Me

Wearing me

Down

Barnie

Have One On Me

My LP of these three discs are almost worn down like the front and back and shedded shed door keys cut by my father and you were farther you were my daddy daddy daddy sylvia plath way of saying sadly daddy daddy daddy David no stronger he didn’t even caere to thjropw a stone no matter how swaddflrecd infinitely Barnabie daddy Barnie daddy David Dani all of you a stone I swallowed Covering me

Heard the cup drop

_Frances saying just after I’d asked if I could have a hug_

_Her happily saying of course_

That’s why they keep her around

I didn’t lnow how to feel bad enough to make him proud

Daddy long

Leg of this journey almost

Ova – wild, wild rover

are you proud?

  
But I found a little plot of land in the garden of gethsemane in the semen that you left in me

I tilled it with my tongue

_There was no one there to dispute my claim_

_The whole place just cleared right out_

_I laid there by a fallen spring_

_No ring_

_But knowing_

_For a_

_Spell_

_But I will want for nothing more in the Garden_

_Start again_

_Meet me in the Garden_

_Wing_

_Bring a friend_

_We are gonna have ourselves_

_A_

_Time_

_We are gonna have a garden party_

_It’s on me, the vending machine_

_Nosiree it’s my dime_

_This is blind ness beyond all conceiving_

_As behind us the road is leaving_

_Andf falling back like a rope gone sleep_

_I fell for you honey easy as falling asleep_

_And no amount of talking is gonna soften the fall_

_But like after the rain, step out_

_Of the overhang, that’s all_

_It had a nice_

_Ring_

_To it when the old Opry House Rang_

_So with a song sing Auld Lang Syner_

_C_

_Delivered Eye_

_Sang_

_And there is hesitation and it always remains_

_Concerning me, you_

_And the rest of the gang_

_And in our Quetiapine hour_

_I’m in love with the hook_

_Uypon with everyone hangs_

_I feel you drawing nearer_

_I feel me growing closer to your steady hands_

_That will not be open to me, save_

_For writing of my lucrative-to-you exploited story, voice, and face_

_You once found just so beautiful_

What did I even do to make you stop

I have to stop

I have slept for forty years and yolk to find you gone

I thought I was safe in your arms

Or legs

On that deep blue velvet headboard bed

So wide, wider than an ocean

Sweating beyond the threshold of your caring

To touch me or my bluetit skittling estrogenic thin and wrestled thresholded skin  anymore

_So careful in their drawing while mine shake and bloat and make such sporadic shapes_

_Lord you know it’s a shame_

_When. I only want for you to pull over and hold_

_Me_

_‘till I can’t_

_Remember my own_

_Name_

_This is_

_The Song_

_For Baby Birch_

_Though I_

_Will Never_

_No,  You_

_And at the Back_

_Of What We’ve Done_

_There Is_

_The No-Ledge_

_Of U_

_Well, Eye_

_Wish We Could Take Every Path_

_Could Spend A hundred (eyes and ears and) Years Adoring You_

_Yes, I wish We Could Take Every (forking, garden) Path_

_‘Cause I Hated To Close The DAW On You_

_Do You Remember Staring Up At The Stars in that little Christmas attempt at a family of the two of us_

_So Far Away in Their Bullet Proof Cars_

_Whenm We Herd, The Rushing Slow Intake_

_Of A Dark, Dark Water_

_And The Engine Breaks_

_And I said_

_How About_

_Them Engine Brakes_

_And If I_

_Should Die Before I Wake_

_Will You Keep an ‘I’_

_On Baby Birch_

_Because I’d Hate To See Her Make The Same Mistake_

_When It Was Dark_

_I Called And You Never Came_

_Be at piece_

_And be_

_Gun_

Hey hey hey the end is near

On a good day you can see the end from here

I saw life and I called it mine I saw it drawn so sweet and fine and I had be gun to fill in all the lines write down to what we’d name her

Our

Nature

Does not change by will in the winter round the ruined mill

The creek is lying flat and still it is water though it’s frozen

So

Cross

The Ears

And miles, and through –

On a good day

You can feel

My love for you;

Will you leave me, B

So that we can stay true

To the Plath

That you have

Chosen

Flight One

Flight

Two

Struggling so much can bearly

Breathe

Flight three

Almost there

But where

And what am I

Climbing Stair leg four

Losing more

Stability

Flight five

Alighting all my life

Flight six

Remembering

Flight Seven and I’m in

Again

Or out

Again

And Arnas has placed my favourite candy on my countertop

Along with a bag

                            A red netting, encasing

                                                        To catch, trussed

Trust                     -                                                       _oranges_

I am too tired for crying until

Sitting on my bed in quiet

Somehow automatically waiting for a nurse’s knock

Then knowing all that stuff has stopped

And

Pop

A weasling note from god, atonal

Glitter through the sky so swiftly timed like a swiss dandelion clock

The moment I exhale, the flames

As if they’re poring out of me

In storming sequence, first the light

And then the hypnic hurting beat

Alone, first or last time home in four long drawn out awful weeks

But home whatever is that anyway just a place to hide from sunbeams

The midde panel open with the angel raising fist in gesture that I’d given to Frances hours earlier as I said the words

_I know that through the deep agony and suffering and such defiant joy I am connected to the endless glowing chain of lives that came and went too soon before me_

_The angel, for this more-than-year of gazing at her garlanded by stars like JD laing_

_All this useless time I didn’t realise her hand was raised (I thought it was a wing)_

_Her shadow had been guarding me from seeing the wholeness of her meaning_

_In Justice, pieces of gunpowder trickle itsy, bitsy down and through the grey clouds gleaming_

_In the only lonely silence that I’d come to know so well of late she seems to sing_

_And in window’s reflection my neon cross inverted, pig-spit, singed and swallowing_

_The colours other than it from the room, my womb, as plumes of indeterminacy coded in controlled explosives rain upon her following_

**_Mantiadromia_**

_Divine madness_ 

_Emantiodromia_

_Emmanuel_ 

_Anamnesis_

_The life lives on in the nature of the body of the earth and rattling the babe of snake of holy ghosted katabatic body of the girl_ 

_Allow the darkness to emerge_  

_Murmur’s murmurations_ 

_Starlings_ 

_Seventeen of them_ 

_The star,_ 

_Sending birds to augur_ 

_Celtic symbols_ 

_Sacred text_ 

_Syncretic synchronicities_ 

_And clambering out like a bell tolls the crow_ 

_Yellow no longer but yellow_ 

_Now_ 

_Out there now into that opener crisper and such depths of deepening air to_ 

_What you know in your own sense of concrescent becoming_ 

_Is the answer your quest of destruction to earth_ 

_Id 3_

_I am Dancing about all the leaving of trees_ 

_And the gulls they are pulling air pulling me_ 

_And telling me all of me in their felling of me_ 

_The tales in the tails of the snakes that I tread and I read in celebratory feast_ 

_A Q_ 

_Made of stain and a feather precedes_ 

_In procession of holiest lessons_ 

_Of process and lunar reality_ 

_The moon as a spool or a tool to catch fish from the sea_ 

_That the dish ran away with as circling dervish to devils hung strung and painted in me_

_Coming home_ 

_I’m home_ 

_I am the home I’ve been looking all over for but the thing is_ 

_That’s just the mister missing E to mixed up no ideology to miss to miss to mist of me to not missus but I miss us to the miss I’ve always been_ 

_Words sent by the goddess are sent through the women and the people I am yet or better still I’m all ways back to why fronts cotton seeming_ 

_Like a beacon_ 

_I am not speaking again_ 

_I let the dead and devilled egg-ones do the conversing for me_ 

_Verses pour_ 

_Oh Lord, ladies_ 

_Ladies_

_Ladies_ 

_Symbology_ 

_Cymbal, O,_ 

_G—_

_Crash the mysteries of us_ 

_Samhain was the loudest howl of deities of this little wave of life_ 

_This living is a cherished Go- a going_ 

_Upon a teeter-totter fairground ride_ 

_That seeming to be endless and then gone, unbound by time_ 

_Meaning_ 

_Less_ 

_With every turn of weathered screw and furthering from child_

_The body of hours- this body of mine_ 

_Of corset_ 

_Of faucet_ 

_Of course it’s_ 

_Mount eerie, peering down into_ 

_My core sings_ 

_With him_ 

_Phil_ 

_Is filling me_ 

_The album called Night Palace while I spent my final days in that White Palace building symbols out of Knights and Bishops from the blackened unchecked box of malice_

_Just is, injustice, rippled in the dusting_ 

_November 1, now gone, that midnight spent with no voice or face or internet_ 

_Unforgettably_ 

_Right now , where drowned in fives I am the diver deepening to life_ 

_Bent and roar_ 

_I am swaddled by the sound_ 

_And the safety of the water, damp and dampening_ 

_Any unintended consequence of my unbridled sun-bride hallowing_

I hear the unheard heralding

Burdened in Unburdening

I talk back to birds Weigh more than I used

Two

I no longer wish

For Wells

Or pulling waves of Hares taut skin bled furled

And there – a bird

Upon the Concrete Angel

I regard her and I write her and then –

She flees

In Flight

I leave my dishes in the night

Oh Elven Rumbling

Lightning Filling me

Oh Lasting Blasts of the Knight

How

Never I have Left

In me and so what if no One ever finds this notebook

Copy, Pasted, Surely Beech of Pastiche, Writing me

All the rectal things I whored and hauled back in side, Honed

A hornet sting, a ring,

When you think about it everything is just a ring

And the great One is a line within

Intersecting never meeting end just paralysing Lysis finding clots in knots of Roads of Going, rowing,

_Gently Down_

The streaming tears of All of them are flowing sewn seeds

No call from my GP, I wake to making just one cup of Tea, no Coffee

In the house I’ve rested guest to guest and cultivated raking breasts of seagulls, heaving, screeching halting toppling book of John

A thunderous Oneness deep inside the lonely

One

Knighted by the crowning of this painful town of memories

I carry them with me

I carry them in my heart with me

I carry them in my enjambment, free

Of naming, voicing syllables inside the rapt in flaming cleaves

And Aged, greatly aged I inflamed my fission, witch, connecting me

To burning books of Bernard, Heather, Lavender, Calendar calls end to Her hurt hurtling lies mise en abyme

Oh, Dribble’s drivel

Dribbling basket reeds float down the

Gentle river coming together

Bamboo, oozing, sweet cane, buccal buckled Fees

 for charon, who by Knights of Ward Rounds night watch ringing wind tines splicing occidental artery

Matted there, my hair I live so far above the grounded pounding heart of magma shopping carts all raptured one by one but my god – Two Get Her

When you think about it cycles are everything to really understand you must start from the middle

Which is the breath

Or death

Or lying naked, shaking in the freeze, a leech

I came to know my Knotted Self as Elf, as much as mulch knows how it’s meant to be

But not knowing anything about the stretching wretched purpose lurking over, under, forestry

Cycles are the All

Psyche, starred as asked Turrets

Of Question after Answer before Quests of Ants walking, carrying incomprehensibly

Like a child I was hurling my first tool to talk to Goddess, how I knew that holy weight, the shape of femininity

And two holes in the shape of script, ineffably

Two renderings of six, six, glyphs

Garlanding the bored-in spine of Boron

Swallowing a Life

A Child

A hindrance booming into bloom

Mercury

I lose count of days and all the ways daily that the heavens, hells (as one) are buoying girl that straddles worlds

I love you

In this space                                                                                                                                      I love you

This feather that travelled under the hood of Cailleach, the lack, Calliope

We are dancing Mother-daughter and the dance is our space between

Wren you think a brown tit

When you think about it

Circles

Lurk Gulls

Hurt Girl thirsty gills from trying to make the paralleling Felling never touching lines to fit

Magnetic Sameness Pulls through text idling engines starting up a rousing all away, a Way out of this

Everything is already music I don’t need to add to it

As I try to catch it, slipping slipping drips of slime

And I look up, is it a bird, is it an old ground planar reed

Pepper mill

You ruined me

And in the fridge I pull out that lambs heart clipped into an airtight clucking tuppence ha’penny so called knot-no-miss-missed call from father farther pedalling  away away a way from me

When you think. About it everything is a spine inside a circular book in the untraversed unmoving depths of Borges infinite library

And the book you read here is there –

All the books you’ll never read are there –

Justified

Jorge, you and they’re the air with me

So start at the middle of this scene, this now in which you find yourself

Even if I’m gone now, by the time this book makes yours or any shelf

At the peg, the singularity of stakes of all

In the centre where so unmoved immutably

We juggernaut our drawn out paths of prehension

Pretending we aren’t a bucket filled with water, a contained and pushed down ocean that’s been tracing dizzied motion through shared separation of emotion

Where I’m going, there

I’ve gone – all the lights burning

Hear, I am in the dark four yew

For Ewe I Lamb

The crucible is learning

And when you think about it everything is absolute

Relatives are swaddled stones you stand on, spinning yarn of You

Everything a Centrifuge

The little bump upon the Copper once glowed angel, bluing, calling

Cooing

It is a flare,

A calling home

It’s not a bird or faecal deposition

Dove Kew gardens

A poem bear

That’s hunting you

Coo, E

The trident of Persephone

Poseidon beckons, reckoning

None of these words belong to me

They’re rented tents of ancestral longing

To be spoken spokes of Reels that pour through pores of clogged pus feline feeling hunch of upper back warmed in arms invisible

That is not a Bird I realise, Now

How did I not how I knotted to avoid the knowing

Grandmother’s house – smelling badly of a potent commode

I want to speak to you with my vocal resonance but something, something , they, are calling me to silence once more or more , for the first time alpha omega

I take the Goat Heart from my fridge and this is not a metaphor although this soulful tome is writ and stitched unpicked with only symbol

Filled with salt, the unnatural plastic pink Bar

Unstuck through and gravity struck stripped laying on the bed

Lifted in defiant roar

Of Holiest of Holy Sawn and Sewn back slightly smaller jaw

That thing, that knot ring

That unduty never avian but alien celestial and unsexed terrestrial lore

Manifest empirical, calling silent through the window

perpendicular to my key-scratched unlatched Loch

There is a pond not far, Queen Spark

Where there are trees whom under and by I’m reminded I’m adored

Adorning in the blood of lamb, the Rites of anger crossing blot

Defiant, defiling

Cold fingers bite against the wind, juxtaposing against the joy of sight of the light sparklers

Beauty intertwined with pain, the parting of such sweet, sweet Sorrow

Full bucket that’s spinning in centripetal centipede feeding on hind leg of its journey

Crabbing – couldn’t feel the line

Pulling the line thinking the plastic was snagged upon rock

But there, an unthinkably heavy

Unthinkably shaped

Arache in Cancer – We dragged her unknowingly

Anabatic through basin of a Cornish harbour, this lovely once funny but now just so resonant memory

Trans women are supposedly seen, but not heard

Trans men are supposedly heard, but not seen

And the third, gender-transcending or surrendering are rarely either seen or heard

But All are felt, felling in the oldest forest of the trees

In the untold oldest falling of the ancestry in the veins of All

The leaves

I don’t want to die

In my room

Ruminating the wilting of Rows of rose blooms

My Own Nation

Where

Three windows lay before me

At the left aching serpentine side lies my cold metal depiction of Baphomet, encased in a lunacy, hung in his place with a silvering ring

And to the right, on my right, the hand with which I write, a rectangular mirror framed in rosewood mahogany

And in the light through these yondering mirrors of barriers to harsh waves of wind that I break

These panels of glass that show Glasgow its shape

The middle one renders clew-truth thus Zarathustra had spake

A dome, Knot in Rome, on a tome-holding library steeped in chase of the Name

Lesser known deity statuesque in divinity perches her right foot rooted firmly

In gesture of imminent flight coming unto me, wyrm about to set free

The smallest grandeur clandestine my dirty earthborn hole-riddling journey

bound in the boundless for airbourne trajectory

She is whispering, with her hand, not a bird but a hand open fisted and raised

Promising her entryway on me, in through me

If I’d just any day open the middling pane

**The end of (thee) Ritual**

I take the Goat Heart from its frozen place

There are flies swarmed all about the window

Where, once watched by you, and her, and them and them and me and you but never you

And Phil heart emptier filling my ears says

The roots ripped are now full of water reflecting sky

The flies I try to swat and think of myself over the last month in hospital

The straight jacket buckled in poetry but

Empirically

Empress card was the last card I’d pulled and she still lay face up where I’d left her

(I’m sure in ignorance, so nervous for the down going journey I’d upturned the message she was scrying to tell me)

I try to swat out the gadflies through crack in the grey light from clouds in the window

Killing a handful by accident

I stand still for a second

It takes

Patience

And withstanding the cold without hatred

Of self or of them

It just takes a little

Time and gentleness

I stood there, yellow flimsy plastic surface for chopping vegetables in hand

Trying to return them to their airy land

Saying aloud to them, breaking my silence

And popping the gravel of oesophageal circle

Through liminal communion trying to get through to them:

“You’re safe, you’re safe, you need to be free but you need help and to let me”

And gently

I let them climb onto the surface

I’d wash it, the cycles of all then assured me

Rose, budding through the cracks

“Go on little buddies, this isn’t the end of your story”

Slowly

So painstakingly (aching my fingers from inpouring air just so freezing)

_I don’t want to lose you_

Sliding the temporary vehicle closer to the opening

Not wanting to look down at those mangled small bodies I’d crushed in my haste

_But some, to make way_

_We just_

_Have two_

Demolition on my phone screen

And animacy of a memory of that Last Judging Christmas we spent in A Bothy in the cold, cold Woods - a small fire, a hearth, my heart burning

You trying your best just to keep its glow warming our bodies and learning

How the pieces of wood once stood tall now stripped thin in their yearning

For fire, this hierophant poking fat phallus slid in with assistance of spit in to this, into cold coal for certain dust destined, this -

Hieroglyph heralded urn of how hurting, ashen returning

Harkening spark no longer strong enough to light

We need space

The twigs and the sticks and the would

It needs space to breathe

If any of this organic mattered

Or cared but it’s not about caring, these glaring truth branches don’t feel Will the same way as we know it

A flame just needs space to breathe

It needs air with oxygen to immolate

But the little sunken fireplace Buddha or teacher or guru or shaman or prophet that One Of The Grates

We gathered close around it to hear parables, but not touching, our forgotten bodies in parallel

Hearing psalms in our blown and rubbed palms

Far

Too late

_In the back of some sound recordist’s garden_

_Being woken in panic, your seed, still_

_Killed all inside me_

_Your semen still swimming alive dying in me_

_Trying to find an absence of Ovary_

_And over me washed this conscious revelation_

_I’d just dreamed the true owner of this wooden place was angry_

I thought of writing my story in linear fashion but that’s not how it works that’s just not how any of this has worked it hasn’t worked

Working hands in the land long before I was gone

_Then, as an echoing answer, or ant’s word, Phil’s song_

_Stone Woman Gives Birth To A Child At Night_

I hear the familiar pain of glass breaking as it’s dropped into the recycling coffin outside of these bedroom windows laid like the graves of a mausoleum in triplicate

I think maybe this time – this has been recurring nightmare in my sleepless paralysis the past half year spent in here as Rapunzel  rapt under the weight of all three years of waiting to hear from you hearing my suffering not healing I never asked you to heel or be guard dog just to look in my eyes but you did and I’m scared or I’m scarred or made sacred by the look that you gave and took breath tied disguised

Maybe this time it’s you

The one time it was almost you it was her

The her that I wanted to know or thought maybe I knew

But this time instead just a little left I saw a van – Luton – London – the place now Bereft

And on the back three – count them – three glyphs

Oh Princes of leagues upon leagues of my people

Bound for caldera and cavernous places

The only low-laid eye regarding

Weighting

_Know_

_That’s Knot for You_

O

Those places that I didn’t want to go

Oh those places we never did

Oh blackest pool of pain

Oh beached whales wailing for the rain, oil-stained, left

On shores of unbelonging sands of reaching, reaping grain

Remembering shame of shitstained dicks all coming out of my intestinally labyrinthine sacred altered space -

Colon: is

Aching

Colon

Is

A shunning

Colonisation

The weathering of this feather, sourced from withered earth uprooted by the tree beneath I’d kneel

(whether sent by Adrian or Ariadne’s Knot)

Has become my holy heather

My mother

And reminds me each time it falls, it feels

That pulling up against the grain will always ruffle all the tethers

But never severed reel

Simply waiting for caress of loving fingers

Placing lace like long-lost lovers’ face in mirroring direction

Semi- hardened heart- stature still, see difficile of hopeless infected erection

Shoving parts of me inside to hide in skin of bear and insect exoskeleton

And now, knot home

I’m here

I hear

Beginning is the requiem

That which was the end

Organic sin

Where sirens sung and spiders spin

That witch wear eye must begin

I turn in two

A seraphim

Exploding, going –

Burning all the human gruelling fuel and fat and ligament

Remains of all the nameless pain within

A voice, a vice

A reckoning

These fireworks come out as Larks

And burn their turmoil, turn their chin

Turn and turn and urn, and immolate my fall fated wings

Of whacks, of wain, injustice carrying

I wonder where the two or three or four or five or all of them are watching all these colours grin

Colours

The cymbal of the day, or rather

Percussion of the night

The drumming dowager downtrodden din

I daredn’t go out

I daredn’t stay in

I may never know what that first memory of a lie, the fall, original sin of somnolence

meant

but here I sit

I can’t stand up

Crossed

Legged

Two egged

Legless

In the debt of it

Weaving words for all I’m worth

Spinning something of a yarn in darkness candlelit

How

Did I get

Hear

The candle remains still until

I regard her, gently, asking for some semblance of an answer

_Wailing to a silent world just begging all the sewing growing of the plants_

_Overgrown and blowing in an unforgiving wind_

_A stopping of the artery’s pulse pod seeded in a needless sense of disorientated loneliness_

_Another half, the downward split_

_bitterness of peas tell stories, promising_

_some_

_thing_  

_apart_

_a hide_

_a way_

_partition makes_

_connection_

_and then, just then, my eyes darted to the candle_

_Squinting, wintering, I am screaming silence deep within_

_And there, a Cross, that’s the shape I got or made_

_Loosed tight in light of my illusory response_

_spreading heaviness of little light, a cancer_

_a smalling partner to this_

_scary sun of explosions across the skies that blanket everything_

_O_

_solitary dancer_

_I_

_Wipe all my hundred eyes_

_Beg_

_In_

With this terminus

A darkened ally

Ash doused and alone

This,

dislocation

These explosions, they are waltzing

I hear them but don’t see them (they’re hiding behind my blindness)

The whiteness of my rolling curtain

On the right, behind the panel of the rite

Winded, chest torn out of sight

You know I am here, sew

Winged thing

Of which I sing

My Northern Star

where are you tonight

Oh wish

I’m A

Oh Wish

I Might

Thirst for the first arms

Seen tonight

I'm sat here by this candle that i couldn't light in the ward, but i'm home for the first night and it's guy fawkes night and i thinnk somethig really bad happened to bme my first childhood memory is of lying to my mother about a nightmare where I was eaten by a giant and i think that's just my traumatised brain overwriting all the seething teething pain with mytheme pushing through the bleeding cavity of chewed out of the taste of gum of gunpower disempowered after recalling in my loneliness of shame of secrets kept and swept 'neath rugs as bugs as sucking toiling tugs again and again should i go out to a tree I dont want to see anybody especially not them I don't want to bump into you in the night my knight in dulled out never shining light

im taking a candle to a tree in Queen Spark

the Park is not named after White Queen Victoria

it is named after Mary Queen of Scots

The Black Queen

the Earl of Moray against the Earl of Argyll as the White and Black Nights

The small village of Langside

The name of the Road where I now the next day with dislocated wrist now write

Supposedly the bodies of all the soldiers are buried under the pond there

I'm going to light it on my Own

but know

I won't be there alone

I have them all, the burning body of the ones who hurt and still, moving, stilling, photographs of memory, still moving through , still hurt, they hurt, they hurt through all the hurt of me

And hear, I go

Here I go out out

Into the

Oh~ the place

Now home, not home

The only place I’ve ever known

My hands are cold and so I speak into a microphone

No

I can’t

I can I can a sardine can

A tin

Alchemical truths that burn within

Stop avoiding it just go just go you’re gone

All the lights on

The windows burning

There’s time there’s time there is No Time

There’s timelessness

In breath

In chest

In redness of the Robbing Breast

In growing breasts

I held my breath

I held my tungsten death

A chrysalis becoming death

Becoming

Death

Be

One with it

Becoming

An Omen

Rest

I will not rest

I cannot rest

Eye, Can, Knot,

A test

If I can leave this place and place an altar take this altar of such suffering and deeply pushed down crests of waves of waving goodbye to the few the hundred eyes the many men who said they would be everything or anything  just anything I wish I may I wish I might I wish I may I wqish I might pleae give me liught just give me light first star mty star I am the only star I am the lonbley only star that’s left that’s right that’s right that’s erightr I will to may I will to spring I will to winter through the plight I will not hibernate or hide I will not stay here out of sight and SEW AND SO AND SOW AND TOW AND TOE AND TOWING GO YOU LITTLE ROWBOAT ROW YOU ROSE YOU ROSE YOU RISE FROM SNOW AND GO AND GO AND GO AND I

Take flight

And idle through the night

Not yet,

But then

And Now – and so

I’ll go

Atop the flight of spiral

Shell and stares of fright

I take my feathered bow

And cauldron

I will take the paddle you planed down

The way I asked you for my birthday

April

Aries

Bound for destruction

Kali

Stay with me

This Knight

This bonnie little child in flight

Please take me with you

Take me with you

Flames, I’m in you

Dancing ‘neath the tree tonight

Like then, back there, hysterical affronted in that garden firing line of sight

Down there but for the first historical time

**The beginning of writ (you all)** 

I am swaddling this glass corked jar containing the little wilted goat heart 

Bedded over roses with a browning wilting of their own 

And emptying my bowels I write this, readying my soil 

Squatting out my dirt, I am preparing in my words 

 for sparrow travelling of worlds 

An arrow, 

A contraction 

I am waiting to be hurled 

Tonight by cycles light 

I drag my womanhood from girl 

Once dragged from such an unconsenting senseless place of hooded straightened curls 

Of measuring tapes of hair of video of riddled with the pearls 

Of hissing through, the wisdom so feet-trodden and disturbed 

Stoned into dominion loves kingdom of an earl 

A song of monarchs monotone of boring through the bone 

Twirling unloved meaning less I shove my finger up through dirt 

And stretch and sweep my anus as if Janus seeking birth 

Faecal fees for ferrymen who just around there lurk 

The riven rending never ending riverbed of hurt 

I have been doing this since that doctor first showed me by example echoing the sound of mouths of sauce-stained water pouring rain it storms and stamps a letter causes wetter swelling pause of yearning earth 

It ushers in the pushing 

Pushing in 

A finger pushing in 

To get a certain skirted something 

Out 

Shirt you left at troas with 

Something that resembled me 

Give it back 

I want it back 

Please can I have my tape player back 

I know you made it riverbent it 

Painted it red and left some just so artful unmarked dark and blackest grey of black 

But you called it mine and I want all of its winding 

back 

Thunderous whack 

Lighting clap 

Moved by some unseen felt force I course my way down from the skies 

My emptiness is calling me in piles of pyres of  

Fire 

Fire

Fire 

Trying to find a energy source for my grey field recorder I can’t find the cord or the battery all the barriers are calling me towards in their negation and I’m getting so frustrated and remember reverence is the only state in which the ancestors will find me so I breathe and tell myself it’s like the felling of the trees I am the telling of the breeze so walk slow but still with purpose oh so purposely and hair fresh stuck with feather I shove the candles sent by Mother not allowed inside the garden wing oh winged things oh so called wicked things oh diamond rings on trees on fingers oh dendritic tents of rose of woe of thorns of crowns above me and I’m carrying my filth and dirt And unclean I douse myself in Oud and listen to the boons outside me I am holding the paddle or the oar you gave me I am planning my escape and I am going to the flame 

A witch hunt for my self I strip my shelves and open up this crushing suitcase and the smell 

I’m sure it matches like the dancing of a flame 

And holy moth holed is the name I think I see you pass in right side bike lane 

I inhale 

Think of my left and right left behind shoes 

And Jamie Stewart, xiu xiu stewarding me closer to the truth in noise in sound in pounding blood into the nails of ears of corn folorn in ripped apart and never greening fields I bleed and seethe and recipe for aster adding sub miss tractor tilling all the earth and all the hurt I am washing all the cloth of blood you bled and spat and shat all over and inside of me 

In that bathtub 

I remain 

I am carrying a bag that’s filled with memory and pain 

And carrying a concertina bound with leather reigns 

All pent up, quintessential energetic blame 

I beseech thee! I beseech thee! Beneath the dark of black Queen’s Park beech tree I became! 

Inside a towel , stuck with masking tape I used to bind my broken nose 

In I go 

I am holding in this purse 

An urn 

An urn of ashes 

Of my yearning 

I am holding swaddled in my unclothedlonging bearly holding in my rain 

No tears of witch to speak just reeking 

Speaking tongues of flame 

In I am 

Outside I’m blocking all the popping of the working fire and flame 

I am walking up a hill of mulch and mush and all their names 

My matted hair and rabbiting stare down at screen a lions mane 

No thought of gender that I was or the surrender whence I came 

I am

Calling out your name 

Sisyphus 

I am mossy 

Rolling soaring

Troll beneath the imminently pouring rain 

In spite of my belief in leaves I look back at this indebted diagonally slanted plane 

Panting 

I enchant the lamplit whip cracked acrid arid lane 

I am searching for what’s left in my rightly outsider heartfelt infernal place  

Maybe here upon a Bench where somebody has laid 

A bunch of daisies and carnations 

No 

I cannot place my hidden heart upon their name 

So I go 

Still walking 

Stilted 

Chalked and stalking for a grave 

Of fire flying and I hear a crow that says 

You cannot stay 

The air is thick with smoke 

With poison and

My poi still lay in waiting 

Barely weighing anything 

Their Shauls of off white 

Collecting stains of memories I can no longer tame 

The darkness is betrayed by pulses rhythmic but atonal and occasional torchlight of wolfpacking family names 

I am searching for my place beneath the shadows of these trees

And screaming little kids are doughing 

Knowing their release 

By skeletal birthright yet to suffer 

Falling reel to reel to creased and just tormented rotting leaves 

I kick them, all the foliage 

Imagine they are me 

The children 

As I was 

Or never real 

I could be 

I have laid my towel down beneath the sky of town forgetting me and there are swarms of flies in my eyes and around the feather guarding me 

No this is not the place no this is not the place for me 

Or maybe I am destined to be insect-bitten beneath a barely big enough clearing of dead leaves 

Too many families 

I am frozen 

I am frozen in my loneliness 

I have to leave 

My jar unswaddled and exposed but incense lit and incensed heart just part complete 

My unfinished recipe 

Looking tumbling out of that temporary hole I couldn’t fit in I stumble and trip over my incense holder and for a second there I find a stick and try to rake the leaves to find it then I say aloud that’s fine unholy mother Gaia you can swallow it like me 

But my lighter 

No 

My lighter 

Blue or green 

No that’s something that I need 

But heading back I see I’ve left my headphones 

And behind the lighter 

Bluest as the deepest sea 

And then 

Upon the liar i left 

Containing goats heart, pink salt, roses, leaves 

A single bee 

Upon the cork 

This unforked path revealing 

All it’s unpeeled teeming secrets unto me 

A bee 

A bee

I see 

A bee 

And in the distance spinning fire poi 

Unlike mine, they are wicked and crafted to be seen 

I want to get out of this place of such disgusting wholeness and just be 

With the bee 

Looking back to blackness of the towel where she’d once been 

She’s gone 

Or hiding 

I pull the Ace of cups (reversed) the seven of cups (reversed, in sympathy) and

The hierophant, as frightening in His Uprightness as the Cloudborne Lightning Shellshocked Bangs above my eyebrows

I am not here for the showy explosions all surrounding me 

_I think of all those bodies buried underneath the pond and swirling of webbed feet of dirtied swans and greyest geese_

These drums, these startling cardiac pipe organs stop beat-drums are heralding the imminence of such a heretofore unseen

event

I just want to be

Alone with her 

The bee and me 

But now, I pack my things, again 

My rendered genome is coiled round this wish to flee 

I know what lancet branches holes so deep inside of me 

There must be another tree 

Somewhere 

Alone where I can breathe into the earth and roots and dirt beneath 

For company 

Come unto me 

Persephone please guide me there 

Where is she 

That lonely little holy bee 

7:17 

It’s time 

She is leading me 

I see a tower, pallid

Sienna

It is  teeming with electricity or flies

And 

An open gate 

I pass through 

I am 

So afraid 

And walking to my left I see 

My name, almost

Just missing the final letter

CALLI

With an X instead of a dot which is just a shrunken circle above the I

_I thought I’d photographed it but I guess I was too empty and filled to the brim with fright_

_Keyboard battery very low_

I can’t believe this place is here and maybe

it won’t be there when try to return and find it again

Which is, as it happens, a thrice-tined fork

Above a symbol of the deepest love and hate 

A swastika

_Queer love destroys fascism_

_A wall hanging here_

_Hanged-man tapestry_

_Above my heid – hidden_

_Unread-written_

_In stars,_

_With a twenty-four pointed star_

_The Hours in a Day_

_(the star)_

_(seventeen)_

_(twenty four minus seventeen is)_

_Seven_

_Hanging over my head_

_I’d been seeing (not reading)_

_Not reeding_

_Not heeding_

_For the past_

_Twenty Four-Fort_

_Nights_

_In Darkness_

_Or Twelfth Knights of the_

_year_

_I didn’t love my Self enough yet_

Beneath the trees there 

I dared’nt go deeper 

_Princesses walking on sacred_

                                                                                    _Scared_

_Ground_

I heard the coldness of the fencepole shuddering the words to me

_This is the realm of the destroyer_

_Crossing here before you lost all you thought of as you_

_This place is an infernal bridge, Her Temple, an atemporal rift_

_A noose in timeless, loosened rope -_

_Abandon hope, Kali gives egress here_

After circling like a dog riddled with anxiety just looking for a place to live not die _oh that Cross above the I_  but Be _and I know I knew who and where had stripped the final glyph, the E_

I sit and 

Taking out my cauldron 

My Caldera 

There, eye 

Their eye watches me in 

wait 

So there I sit upon the closed in opening 

To right of tower 

Holding onto the seventeenth card 

that had at upon my altar for this worst year of my life and I write 

And I light her 

I alight her 

Lined up cauldron atop Azoth symbol and wide eyed and cloaked 


In my increasing of my sight 

I look up and see an A encased within dendrites

Of my eyes 

Of the highest holy by my candle light is that you Adrian 

Or arachne 

Or Ariadne 

Or aeon 

Or all of these ailing parts inside of me 

A is for Apple or Adam or Absolutely Everything An outstretched hand to

Ancestors 

I think 

And know knot

Adrian or arachne or Ariadne or aeon or the ancestors or Allness or Anarchy as if Guy Fawkes’ or Forking gardens of the wardens who came before and he became a beacon or a mythic synthesis of

 Anyone

Anybody?

Body of work

And I pull cards, Ace of Wa

Write 

walk in from singing with my concertina in a strange clearing in Queen’s Park I’ve never seen before next to a strange tower with a fence around it with the gate open as if welcoming me in and so I went in and then on a broken piece of metal were five letters (underneath a swastika…. A sign of love and hatred but most likely the latter considering so I dared not go further in convinced because of the hopelessness I’d been carrying that there I’d probably be killed but just there before that threshold I laid down my altar cloth and sang an improvised hymn and burned the star card in my cauldron praying) then I come home emptied and just hoping to be filled again and think about the garden wing and say aloud “what was that even for” and then think I’m not just talking about the time in hospital and but maybe also ritual not just formal magick but the rituals of everything of breathing life and love and loss and then

The spotlight right above me in the hallway turns itself off

And I smile and say again those three words “they are here”

And go to wash my hands of all the ash and mulch from crawling through the earth to find the perfect place to pass through and to do my rites and coming back into the corridor forgetting now I have to manually turn out the bathroom light I didn’t realise at first that little bulb’s illumination had returned but then as i raised my hand to try to find the feather that had become a weathered symbol of those passing birds I loved in read remembrance so much more than words and hold and touch and came to trust now dust to dust to just as much as books who’ve now took flight and finding nothing there, that one little thing I’d held so close as thorny crown the whole hallowed and so hollowed returning journey to this town I see the feather must have fallen into all the dirt I hoped would cover all my buried hurt inside that little yearning clearing awestruck awning or some organismic cosmic yurt I think, and drink the air, and beholding nothing but the letting go I sigh saying to myself

That’s fine

Some things just must be left behind

I think about that break in the fence and wish I’d gone deeper

So virginal then, sleepless little creeper

But still, I am so sure that death was the only one that I’d find

There was something or some Body in there

I am trying to capture a picture of fireworks through the mirror reflecting the view from my w

And then

Again

Out goes the light

Walking back into my room so full of stench of selves I shed into the cloth of my knot-unbelonging

There, squished and still moulded to the shape of being stuffed into my suitcase

I see my bear and hold him, Colin, with your cotton black sewn eyes please see me, sea, me, seamen, seed of all the men who halved me, semi-colon,

I am not a seagull

I am not Johnathon, Living still, But dying into All I Will to become

Her I is on me -

I am a finch, a redpoll, red pole pulsing like a

phallus – blasted tower -

_Lingua Undulatio_ – a wave – goodbye – suicide note – a poem – a poet – a rapper – a wrapper – a covering  of – the stone

A crow tries to climb up to the top of the library dome –

Infinite

Outside my window

The crow toiling, crying and pecking and trying to find food from the bits of chewing gum excrement and the angel she still sits atop the dome outside my bedroom window just the other side of the glass wall

Atop the fist the finch she sits, so peaceful, resting in elegance

And the crow, left side, bottom, shits –

And he looks at me as if giving up in recoil and repose

And unsteadied, ready, goes,

The finch she now regards me for the first time, as a Rose

And I say to the meadow that it was for letting go of the Big Thing and the opposite to the sky holding a canopy open to these colourful explosions as they burn and my mountain man singing not to or about me specifically but I imagine he’s here next to me saying

_I love you_

Isle of you

These bewildering wildernesses of loss

Are blooming in such secondary hues about me

Oh god

I am so desperate to know what happened on this night and I cry out why do I need to know and in the lack of answer I just scream an answer to myself BECAUSE I DON’T DESERVE TO HAVE SUCH DEEP HURT HIDDEN FROM ME

And Why does everything keep spiralling away from me

I think a part of me thought this ritual and flashes of white might bring flashbacks of memoranda into my gadfly sad, sad, sad little life

_I scan the horizon from the spot where I lie_

Picking a spot on the upper right side of my forehead I

Realise it’s one of countless bug bites

Each one an answer from an ancestor trying to help me scry the Y shape sign that keeps on winding its way into my penultimated life

A is for All

I miss them all

In my lonely little life

Looking left I see the title of the book by Yanagihara I still haven’t brought myself to read

I miss them all

All the people wound inside the steely sugars phosphenes mouldy clews of DNA

And all the letters of the words of worlds built up every hour as a tower never said

And in stead

Turning in their living graves of waving greetings to the dead

I am lying watching fireworks in bed

Waiting for the quiet of quetiapine to weave and worm its way in swathes[Z](#_ftn15) across my head

And even all the characters of all the books I’ve never read

**The first dream here** 

Love is 

Thick penned 

Sinking into rain stained papyrus 

And life is a little fish and I roe

O I am trying to catch it as it swims 

Call me

Female-ish

The medical clergy 

This team of white coats with pockets that clattered and formed a percussion section of an orchestra and through my door They all burst into my room saying 

Well because you’ve deleted your instagram stories which depicted our machines 

You’ve killed them 

Our babies 

They were like our children 

And we’re sorry but now you have to go 

Afraid, considering the possibility that I was headed for an even more harmful form of incarceration or maybe even death 

The orderly was dragging me down the complicated mess of escalators where I’d got lost and tried to find my way back to starting leg of this 

Kicked out of hospital 

Which was actually just 

A

Shopping mall

And now, 

Waking up so drowsily 

I 

Say 

O

U

Have no idea 

 I saw the word gate when I came back from the threshold 

I saw the words Dave 

And Paul someone sprayed into brickwork 

Immediately looking left I saw “Great news!” On a shopfront 

And under umbrella of all of these fireworks 

I lifted my days and remembered my name and I saw all the spores of rain dancing to idling verse 

And so smiling I drink them through sides of my mouth where both my canines bookending the incisors had cracked leaving windows for these little wel selkie sprites to ingress their way blessed accidentally making them house guests Input of saline hydration to counter the same salty water escaping my

Opening 

My laptop I see a picture of an Ostrich in a desert 

I feel such a deep sense of regret for not going deeper Last Night

Judging that threshold as my looming end

But perhaps it was the loom of weaving my beginning

To respect both above, and below –

There was something or someone or both waiting in there for me

The gate ajar, a welcoming goodbye

That sign, that symbol, now warped by pain of history was left to stir such hurt, discomfort while still hiding ancient truth from Love of East

And a previous iteration of me, did, or would have,

_Did_

Step through, unburdened, burgeoning – to meet

Whatever one or two or three or four legged-or winged infernal thing would have brought certain defeat

The untold trauma of my darkness would have, did, or Will beckoned me

Now, more hurt, more trodden in the dirt than I ever thought I could have been

_My journey, here along_

_There’s only One_

Integration, that’s the oldest newfound key to my chest

Respecting up and down, in knowing of the unknown

The Ace of Wands, pointing back, into that blackest Knight of black, an almanac

not telling me to turn and run or turn and go deeper but just (as a nervous dog, for a moment, might encounter a bear inside a narrow cave)

To Sit

To Stay

To Keep up hackles, but not tackle

To remain

Where I scattered ashes of every fire ritual I’d performed in HIS infernal name, in all four points of a cross around me

At the boundary

The Border, where I stood, then sat still, hooded

Lining all the ties as laying tiles to paths to personhood I’d aged into and let into me

The person I was would have either rushed in there, to meet her end

Or Simply Never Gone There

Oh

The Places I have Been

At night

And so I know, with this teeming insect of regret I feel, I know –

In light

Today in this overcasting play of greying Scottish Winter Light

I will return there, in the light

Where, witch, I’m A

Where, hunt I might

Become the star I burned that night

With safety of the salt I am but stakes ignited, flaming, such great heights

That lurking herd behind heard squeezing box bee shanty pyre to warning, warming, improvised

But in the day No One will see me waving my goodbye

These flies at the crack in my window they want to leave but they just keep getting dragged back by instinctual hunger to the dirt

KSHÆ’L, Kali, All the same but only if we let them breathe

They need our bodies to breathe

And in the holding or the huffing of it, either burn or blow away into the leaves upon the breeze

I’m sure the hospital kicked me out in time for Guy Fawkes’ night because they thought I would burn down the place

Maybe, without that physically embodied ritual of return, an urn, a crucible, I would have

I’m looking for you, or them, or him again in glass bottles breaking like a meerkat

Am I

Scared – sacred?

Curious or

Crushed by all of this and there I see a van marked

CONTRACT CLEANING

I have to clean this

flat

My Hole life a burning

At some unknown stake

Meat, flesh, yearning

I turn over the Empress -she’d been waiting, reversed in her reversal

The Quintessence of pentacles arrives, unshuffled

A woman, travelling through harshness of snow past a stained glass window – light through – breaking

And a man

Behind her path but foregrounded by perspective to the Seer

He tries to walk with crutches

Ailing legs like that Bee I still believe I aided first, thirsty for her resurrection

Broken

Leading, not directly

Not exactly helping in the healing sense

But Leading, Past the Light, no Thought of it, but By Example                                             _Feeling_

The sonic and semantic layers of language are more connected than anyone seems to be seeing

Some things are not meant to be seen and perhaps that’s been the cause of all this unravelling

Righting my wrongful direction; I correct the course of my arm and find the cable to my dextral side

Where Colin, fallen in the night, this lone bear beneath his wax-winged Filling Moon

I say to him, an object of my deepest care and yet in my unconscious hypnic jerking motion

my reigning rain of hypno-water-gagic psychlic wave had cast him ashore below me to the carpet

and now, and then he lay beneath a web of tangled cables, coated in textile

_-my auguric and arachnic insufficient label of autistic profiled sensory distaste at glossy silicon coated copper wiring being shown to me in such sweet sorrow-_

_-fullness (more or less) in parting words on pages bound in stabbing spine of book of_

_Revelation_

I pull him from the gravity, his softest grain providing providence in gaining lost sensation

_Oh Colin, my sweet bear, I’m sorry_

_At the back, your visage, captured midst the bustle of the coven claw_

 _you held a backpack containing overnight clothes that I know of yours_

_Post-screen photograph still, showing_

_A lonely cast, a carp, a spell, a broken right leg plaster cast_

_Ashore_

_And you and they all who tried to tell me it was a dinner party, nothing more_

_I couldn’t have cared less the context of the gathering_

_But the trying to be out of sighted screening cover up by one, plus four_

_It was this_

_That was betrayal of the tale I’d stopped my heart to end this peace of artless narrative, trussed in terminus of lovelocked and blocked knocking at your door_

_Quoth the haven_

_Nevermore_

Months pass by and the vase, filled, emptied, filled, a stripped again and again with tulips and Sunflowers

_Sylvia is your Sun_

_But I was and am the Moon, or no_

_You were my Moon and Sun_

_And I will always be the Space_

_No Force, no power, just ache of Space_

_To stain the sheets and pillowcase_

_To be replaced and_

_Nothing more_

[INSERT CONVERSATIONS WITH IHHN]

I run, dance through this hallowed small space

I play Lykki Li’s reversed album, released as I myself was conceptualising a palindromic gordian knotted mobius stripped naked work

was reversing myself

anyway

I run to my belongings and her voice is calling me back

And then I run to the whiteboard,

 the space of such love once, where four of us had recorded quotes of each other in different colours that made us laugh

the space of such pain, going quite harmfully insane writing symbols of kites with no strings of the double bass turned violin I became

 and then try to write the concept for this part of the book using the dry-wipe tear-washed pens,  just the same

the four colours belonging to each of our names

trying first, turquoise green, I write TAKE UP REÆL on the leftmost pane

and in aged, wrinkled winked inkling through necessary force I applied, all usable hue from ink, it had drained

then the next, not realising then, not listening (by divinity’s design -weight of the safety of rules to this great cosmic game)

to the cymbals’ symbology of these tools of my mother tongue, calligraphy, crashing out like a wave

again from this pen was the use found in uselessness, dis-ability, sick-ening, f-lame

and the third, then the fourth, until finally came

the medium’s message, the flightpath of sparrow,

the zenith of mountainous mole-hilling arrow

of zeno’s so seemingly counterintuitive infinite bow

Energetic Essential Etymologi-cally Epithet Eating –

Endgame

_Dear god in my classic tangential etymological (note: I must add Etymologi-cally to the above passage between ‘Essential’ and ‘Epithet Eating’, it perfectly references the fact that my father was the first person to give me my true name, just spelling it ‘Cally’ instead*)_

_*this was at first a loving symbol of attempted integration from an external perspective – using the forgiveness of my biological (and simultaneously Holy) Father, to fuel a ritual of empowerment through reclaiming his attribution of me as a child but trans(?!) muting, **transmutating**** this original sign of the light of love, which then through the reaction of mutating my birth given name it turned into a fluorescent-lit screaming illumination of what rejection of my true identity my given F[F](#_ftn17) ather and closest Family became)_

**_**transmutation in genomics refers to a change in nucleotide sequence of an opposing strand of DNA, much like the necessary dance of the two serpents about a caduceus_**

-               **_in fact what could be more beautiful and physically embodied symbol of the Caduceus than the Genetic code we all share._**

O

It happened again

What I was trying to say and do and say

Was that as I took to the suitcase, not realising the greater symboplic resonance of all four of our pens wearing out, drying out, leaving no way to write on the cupboard-doors-turned-whiteboard that had held my unravelling

And found a different symbol of the same motion (but quite in reverse) a cylindrical roll of paper that I’d ordered during my hospital stay

_Stop rhyming when you start rhyming and rhythmically versing you get sucked into wild tides of ineff—_

Fucking hell

What I was trying to say

Was that in clearing my ~~space~~, no, flat, no The Way

_Just stop resisting at this point it’s more effort to complain_

Is that I found an envelope, ripped, which contained

A note from the previous hospital stay

From the last time a man penetrated my form[B](#_ftn18),

At the top right, the logo of that thrice-travelled place

A Circle

But anyway

I looked at the roll of paper I’d ordered to the hospital to try to express myself in some way during this period of obstruction and compressed oppression whether its origin was imagined or perfectly red-thread-traced

 And realise I don’t want to use it, because there, not over, not under, but rolled through its waves

Where the blank bits of flip chart paper I’d ripped from the groups room as performance, preservation, defiantly bear-hunter-gathering batshit-insane

I hadn’t known but had known but now knew in the blue skying light Sun that is leering and clearing my face

That this is the physical paper, the papyrus I should plan this work on

So terribly lacking in empirical functionality, but, so, _so_ charged with hermetic energy

Noam’s Arc, Nima’s odyssey –

The penning of these

Is far less important that the conceptual release

And the E

And the

Using the watercolour pens my mother also sent (she really did send me so much love in her place, we really are just all trying our absolute best even if it doesn’t matter even if that sentiment is enough that realisation is enough and I don’t need to pen any counter-balancing-act or express shadow of this light because nobody came to visit me in hospital but she sent me this parcel, filled with things that symbolised such reaching, reaching out to me yes but also encouraging my own reaching through example of hers, Reaching Toward Light through the concrete slabs of this chess board – and Arnas, A-rnas, A

RNAs*

Arnas sent me Colin by mail

Both of us not Knot-Male

Their nonbinary** earthing bound to my feminine flame

*Oh jesus, gotta get into this later

**Aery-Aries-Bound-Aries-Arise

Oh Gods, Goddess, Lykke Li sings ‘how many days how many nights on the floor’ reminding me this singed and burned semi-carpeted part swaddled with holes to let light of gnosis and shedding of dice-chance-diagnosis to return with the gift of you goddess these Holy Holes in me[.†](#_ftn19)

I realise I’ve returned to the physical space of my unravelling, my prior*, literal katabasis to this spot[X](#_ftn20) on the carpet, paralysed by all the grief from all of the incessant loss

I’ve returned here to write this, in my cardinal cross

With my own gift of goddess, this most-woven-yet-so-unravelled tome rolling stone-gathered moss

As _Samhain_

by Molly-Anne-Chinner

finishes in its lyrical sound:

_Hum Ancestors Walking Sacred Ground_[_△_](#_ftn21)

I’ve got to think about things grounded in physical at least briefly because I need to order more ADHD meds (obviously) which face a national shortage and every month it takes ringing 

Ring

Around the Rose

I go to take a shit and find the number for the GP (proud of myself for being so multitudinously Earthy) 

And I change the sound source via Bluetooth to my phone to hopefully drown out the peaks of amplitude of my trough-sloughing-off of my original sin within my faecal shame 

And then, god, the name 

Gardens in bloom by Colin Stetson plays 

I have to write all this in my notes app and realise most of this book has been written in such unavoidable bursts of fire and that must be (I don’t bother looking I’m sure it’s correct or at least resonates enough for me to not need confirmation*) 

*Confirmation 

The word inspiration 

In(spire) 

In the word spire 

Is Pyre 

But with I 

Not Y 

My father’s name for me - the same as mine but with no E or no I but a 

Y? 

_Why_

_Or_ 

_A branched path_ 

Or your Y fronts I loved watching fall wanting the tallness and roundness of all of you in the bath 

Or my mouth 

Or my ass

¥ which has a comment by them lovingly butchering my lyrics•

•should I mention this explicitly or protect them in anonymity I don’t know if I really want to ever speak to them again it still hurts so much but I suppose it’s hurting less each day and I did say happy birthday on that still Libra day where I felt some sense of balance even within the restraints of that hot jacket potato-famine esque place 

And they replied saying they’d been thinking of messaging me that day, whether true or not it doesn’t matter - then apologised, especially for the way they’d been meanly responding of late - well - not recently then, but the Last time(s) - Tyne - A river not too far from here - hear their apology and take it as sincere for your own sense of - 

Anyway 

They then texted again during my stay 

Then it was Scorpio season 

(Now I’m still perched on the toilet thinking about a scorpion inside of a circular flame again) 

They asked if they could use my story in their Zine and if I was still in residential treatment and that they’re thinking of me and that they’d take my silence and no pressure to reply but I still haven’t had it in me to get back to them 

Or known whether I want to 

Who knows if they were just checking to see if I was still nearby 

Maybe another backpack packing panic before dinner party type of night 

But anyway 

Any way 

Either way 

I need to plan this book or work or holiest grail of my becoming on that flip chart paper in preparation for the ritual at Hell’s Gate 

And then - after a shower - I need to be clean for this - I must virgin myself, dry myself in the wetness 

I’m going to add the E to those 5 quintessential letters***

And embody the whole of the holes in the holiness of my own 

My 

Own

Crap (finished in the bathroom now) 

I need to call the GP and get more meds 

Looking top right at the frame of the screen I see the ultimate sign of unity 

Like a salting of eye which is also spelled I 

Realising my Battery is about to 

_Sunflowers by Christy Moore comes on divinfernal shuffle_

I begin my Opus

Or rather, start finishing it

Using these watercolour pens on this rec room flipchart paper of a yellowish-beige hue

_God Dick_ by Circuit des Yeux plays

Circuit –

Des –

Yeux –

And I dance, twirl so smoothly and whirling widdershins twice, rotating counter to my circular motion as a Moon to a Body of Greater Mass

And then Deosil double, but with jarring rhythmic more primal jutting gestures, like a queering of gender remembrance balancing act

And, (I have never done this before during thousands upon thousands of rituals performed at this altar)

I stand

One footed (right)

Wobbling, swaddling, I balance myself

By lifting my Right arm in defiance of Self or more likely acceptance of the Not-Self, the realest reel spool of Wealth

_I nearly have enough crowdfunded donations to cover my rent_

I perform, as a sacred mirror, in this scared, now-knot-so-secretly scared of light nightmarish place

An homage to that unnamed Angel

WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO DO

[crossing ritual]

While WAITING FOR THE SHOWER TO HEAT UP ITS BEEN TOO LONG SINCE I USED IT FROM MY TIME AWAY THE MUSIC TURNS ITSELF DOWN AS IF TO SAY YOU DONT NEED TO RECOED EVERYRHUNG THAT HOPENS TODAY THE DIVINITY AROUND YOU IS GOING TO KEEP HAPPENING ANYWAY

⁃               Call GP on the way

⁃               Add the message to the SINNER CIRCLE (the three that once made four) that wasn’t an apology but some kind of old living branch

✓             GET IN THE FUCKING SHOWER

THEN

NO CALLER ID RISQ CALLS

1.            Wash face

2.            Place right finger above head and left finger below tailbone pointing to the sky and sea respectively

3.            Cleanse body, start with armpits then work downward in circular katabatic motion

4.            Face south

5.            raise arms up to the ceiling (it’s okay if you are too tall to stretch them entirely as I was)

6.            Face north

7.            Shape arms into an O (previous sentiment relating to lack of space still applies)

8.            Wash face

Exiting the shower (the first gate)

Back to almost dryness im scrying in my underworld suitcase for a clean shirt and in futility it seems

Then in my draw I see the only clean item of clothing - a tee

Shirt that has a trans flag in the shape of this history of gore and holiness wiped out from underneath

Scotland

And I hold her with me

And I shroud my small breasts in her breath our heartbeats dancing dancing dancing

Find a skirt or your little shorts but don’t wear the trousers

You wore trousers the first visit this is perfect this is it

I can’t find my hairdryer

I can’t find it

That’s fine I think they’re sending me reasons as always

Finding my hairbrush instead I briefly think about how just brushing one’s hair is sometimes good enough to invite more air in

To dry it

I can’t find my hairdryer but instead realise in my looking I’ve not yet moisturised my face

And in doing so realised I haven’t shaved

I can’t find my razor this was an item I had to keep hidden from staff as obviously they’d have confiscated it

And so I’m looking I find the crescent moon windchime she asks me to take

I can’t find my self

It was my thrice-unclean self that had prevented my entry

I can do it I can do it I can do it

The page I turned to in my first visit to the threshold

The light is almost gone

I think not of my final words to my long lost sister , a play on words (as ever)

Or on letters, rather

An acronym used by those playing games

Through devices of so many different names

GLHF - Gods Light Has Faded

The windchime twinkles like three studded stars in my left hand

Hair still damp I defiantly clip my shades on

(Also in opposition to their absence at Last Judgemental communion)

And then in silence

I’m gone

Windows open

After blowing out that briefest candle of No One

For everyone

I leave, burning

all the lights on

Including that one in the hallway

They aren’t here

I have to run to catch up

As I try to catch them

Down the stairs I try not to

Fall

The chain with the triple goddess wrapped round  my left pinky finger , no ring to speak of but next to it , where martimony may be gravestoned

A rose

A ring

Not red but dark dark silver

Outside

Confirmation

The sun is gone

No matter

The meaning of this war shall be won

And reasons, so far, my father , beyond

I’m still leaving these shades clipped on

And then following my triskelion pendulum

She tells me to circle so I turn in the street , finding no one

But an X on the floor

(I just further forward passed the graffiti searing into me seeing me staring

Milo was here

Studio malkuth

Maat

And then in neon red scrolling

El

And

5

And passing me from the opposite direction a father is swaddling his son

Free handed, and planned this familial amalgamation

The baby is clipped to him safely

And then , walking with me , like a starling mate in murmur worshipping Noah built ship of murmuration

Sporting his own shades for a different

Or maybe the same reason

A blind man. Bent down double

Almost perpendicular in form

Forming a Gamma ray shape

Past the cafe where you’d take me for coffee

Endlessly

Looking back seeing the boba shop

Named CUPP

down again Milo was here again here again there I go again

Almost at the second gate

Iron wrought

Welding my fate

There pointed to by my pendulum swing I saw wings I saw wings

I saw another offering

On the litter bin

Milo was here

I hear

I hear

I’m hear

Are you here, Ra?

Are you Hera?

And from this arose, with a bicycle almost mowing me down

The unblackened swan webbing networked event

I had to take off the shades

That’s okay

I heard the herd say

If This seething and senselessly meaningless treason of peoples I am and who wind inside sea of feeling

Has taught me anything

It’s That No thing

Up the hill again retracing what I think is the same path

Yes

There.  In knight of black-

The flowers laid

White

Still retaining their shape

Roses

In holiest rows of the name

Upon the bench where I knew I just could never stay

Where you said hey

Maybe we should see where this dating

Takes us

And here’s where I ended up

Still sissy

The dark is still scared of me

But through the anagrams of jumbled up letters I see it’s sanctity

Still Sisyphus

Reaching the top of this mountainous peak

The pendulum tells me to turn around

Where I see

An unlit lone bush, barely

Bear

Li

The album is called EYEYE

_The first, unreversed version released two years and a part, near the start of our story_

_I remember those songs felt so healing in hearing their hurting while you held me_

_And now their reversal it hurts as I hold myself in my own healing_

 visible but I see

I see you silently whispering to me

As I start yet another descent

Breathe

You did all the rite things

The bell jarring angel chimes

Gaining her wings

A little further

I don’t remember this crossroads

Placing the shades in my bag I hear a single firework

Tripping,  again over the third barrier

I open the gate

And there

The same place

I returned

Lesson learned

By some unknown and gone name

Dear gods and goddesses the energy of this place

My neck cracks, and hairs on back hackle

As I take out the candle

(I can’t find my lighter, resistance from the opposite god, who’s the same)

The crackle of twigs

All about me

About them

They are

Here

And are hearing me breathlessly

Calling their name

As a letter

Opener

Air still but so

Thick

And I take out the windchime

And hang it in a bolted hinge

That was placed there in waiting

For this very moment

Who knows how long for

But it drops, not meant for her, and instead I must place her in a plastic noose already wrapped round the fencepole

The synthetic supporting the organic, which itself encases the eternal:

I think of leaving her there forever

Or however long it takes for the weather to get her

And again I think of the feather

And of my mother, heather

The best she can do is still so much better

Than anything I’d ever done for my children

Of yester

Day

Un

Till now

I am birthing and holding all of my Bonnie wee children now

Rows of roe

They birth their own babies now

I sway away fear and I let in the sacred now

I take out my knife that I whittled another wooden blade with now

Above me

A crow

Or a sparrow

Or nightingale sleepless in this undead night now

I sway in the silence

Hearing music of ancients now

I saw a crow in my shadow around the flame now

I dropped the blade by so called accidental design now

In occident orient chimera I bend now

I have to rake through the nettles and horned with thorn lost all their roses bush mush of filth earth and dead leaves now

Oh how they all are dancing here

Hear them

The rhythm

Ra is them

The Sun and moon

And I hear them

I

Here

Them

The candle blows out by a wind from the north now

I let it be out

The light is in me now

They have put it there to guide me in there deeper now

I pick up the knife and in doing so bleed now

the ancestors needed an offering of fruit from the vine now

I acknowledge my terrified hide but unhidden now

I pick up the knife and scratch the sacred side right pointing three pronged speaking in thrice spoke wheel tongue within tongue within tongue ladder rung way of the trident now

A symbol which pointed the way for the hunt of the witch now

And breathing in epochs

I step through the gate now

The fourth I step through now

The river I bleed and I cry and I piss now

My flashlight goes out as I try to record now

In darkness my heart stops and I, shaken, steady more now

My eyes will adjust to the dark and drain colour now

To see better cones must rise rods fall to monochrome now

And I see symbols, sprayed upon a downlaid dead trunk now

The corpse of a yore obliterated inside me now

And before trying to leave my body their bodies their enblazened and blackened great mountains of ashen and unsung songs bodies of work now

Scream STAY do not leave yet there’s still stones to stand on now

And so I obey, breathing through all their pain and my own and the grief of the last endless millennia

And being told very loudly in rustling leaves now

I follow instruction and plant my root upon the seat that they made now

A throne, and a stake upon witch mistakes burn now

And yearning for leaving no longer I’m told now

It’s okay to close because you have opened up now

And the most tropical sounding bird I had ever heard chirped now

Five times

Five times

Five

Fingers

Two adorned with rings

A rose to my left

And an octopus tentacle wrapping my right

And then three

cù-sìth

I will not be brought to death in terror this time

And then four

And then four again for

And then four again, more

And then four again, she

And then four again, for

And then four again fore

And then four again

I open my voice memos to try to record her and later identity her divine source using digital means that well named are alluding to truth held in blade aching for such release

Excalibur

Inside of

The stone

The woman I am gave birth to a stone child on this night

The birdsong has gone, never heard, or rather unheard, unrecordable flight

And I stand up

I can’t sit down any longer

And pass back through, past the E

To the next letter F

For the future

Before me

I feel the most rushing loud waves passing through me

And know I have become a dove burned so cruelly

With love and with loss and with love in the losing

I step out into the opener

Open

Air

I can

Open

Can opener

I can open her

Aer

I can do it

I’ve done it

And there

And right there

Where I left it the candle wick fixed a repair

Offering chance to do over,

Carousel by lykkie li paused in this layer

The candle is almost burned down now

The cards I pulled

Stared

And as stairs

As threads of becoming

Embroidering chair

Upholding a truth once cut down, hard to bear

Hunted softness I taught I finally wrought there

To the west I have learned, from water: The hierophant crossed by the devil

To the east I burned, in fire: Eight upturned pentacles, crossed by six of the same

To the north I yearned: Nine of wands facing east, crossed by princess of swords

To the south I earned:Ace of wands facing west to my past, crossed by last Judgement’s herald upturned

And out ward

Widdershins

About the axis of my sinistral plantar-planetary shin

I turned without thought

Without much mortal kin

But I turned nonetheless

Wider

Winding the spiral the spider, inside her

So much wiser

Within

There was green shards of broken glass on the floor

Where I’d sat with abandon just the night before

the candle goes out as I type the word “there”

AHHHH AHAHAHA WHEREVER WHEREVER WE’re meant to be together

By SHAKIRA

I’ve never listened to her on my streaming river of music recording algorithmic history EVER

The ancestors sending such a funny response as a balance to the sombre just-recorded reflection were meant to

Be

Together

Outside the park fence, I look back, not back, but in

And see that French trefoil symbol I can’t remember the name for

A reason

Every

Planted and Lilith supplanted by

Evening thing

For a reason

Looking for

A rolling

Paper for smoking

As I pause the album at the song named D-5 (but reversed)

Again

In order to shed more light on my satchel

I find no such flimsy and flammable thing

But I do find some kindling, more leaves never leaving

Just staying their place in this load that I’m carrying

And I think again of the chains placed so loosely with weighting

In the wait to be

Lifted

Arisen

Im sifting

Through memory contained in these objects of longing

REVO (or OVER reversed is now playing)

And I see my provisional

Divine providence vision on

My purse, zip long broken

My plastic card slipping from

Within confines of identity id placed upon

It, er sie ist

Ich bin ein und du bist

Of the wrist

The first to break upon falling

And the last one to mend, for a reason,

The calling

The treason a Rite ink desk I previously wrote on, a lesson

That the goddess beheading is wearing tritone

Of devilish blessings strung through all the skeletons

Of heads the men’s skulls of becoming attention

Be coming

A tension

This is where my notes rest, under the monstrously focused spotlights fluoresce

As my battle with chariot charging my battery’s lost again

Remembering you changing your WhatsApp profile photo to the image of you holding a wooden sword high above you at the gathering of that now long lost cult in the forest that gathering I just couldn’t bring myself to break into and now I know why I know why I wasn’t meant to and I am so sorry I am so sorry for and to all of you

I beat the sickness

The E key on my keyboard (lexicographic, not musical) is sticking again

I’m not making any of this up but shaken it’s making me

[TO ADD – LIDL RECEIPT]

Before entering my horizon again I exchange the placement of my own rings

Rose now on right, dragon or serpent or kraken on left

Marrying myself

A gain

The first thing that enters my body is pulverised Apple

(witch A is for)

And then first, dessert, I’m starting from where I should end

And then one of the autumn leaves collected by moisture of the Heart’s Jarring swaddling cloth showed me next in the sequence of eating-  the black pork-

Squealing down throat singing forking pathways of checkerchopped board into Life

In the Lowness of pH

The acidic and arid and place

Where

Every

Body is just

Waiting

_Celeste_ by Charlotte Jacobs (bookending the earlier occurrence of her song Owl – the O – the howling eyes of God’s guise in me)

Comes on by itself

And only at first, again, the last lyric is heard by my unravelled self

_‘We Are Here’_

-Which I raise to the sky in fullness as I had my emptied fist

And say thank you ancestors for this flesh I shall merge with my own as a gift

I eat the whole thing, though with breaks to wipe stake-sticking oil of the burned and broken cured body from fingers to write of this tryst

Three rows of flesh – different but One

Salami – Pork Loin – Garvaõ

I eat from the right, middle, left, down to left, middle right, weaving like a blanket’s thread trail or genetic tail might

I close my eyes and feel the saliva washing over the not-gone but part of me pig to return her to some ocean

Of salt

Closing my eyes I see a tree

As the words of the song I am hearing or being sung tell me _‘please, breathe’_

_So Far – flashmob_

And in heeding, or reading or hearing their asking, I breathe in and again close my eyes to find:

An A

An Other A

Something within m reaches out to grab the jar of sliced

pickle

(at one time this was your name for me)

Lamenting just for a second the fact that now my favourite food is itself pickled in memory of you

And Back to the Fermented Cucumber, Cooling my heat

I eat three, obviously

Back to the restraint and coldness of preservation I place them

Automatically picking up next in the sequence of meal-beads – the cheese

Simply so I could make the line rhyme in my life’s rose of poetry

I can’t get into the packet so I use the same knife which scraped on the E

I eat just one slice, curdled children to unity

Garlanded by blackest peppered in credulity

Returning her yellowing paper thin to the re

Fridge, almost full I regard the red ring of chorizo meat

And decide in my stomach-sighed gurgling to just leave her be

Outside of this truth now I sit, silent, happily

Time for re-dressing wounds of red dresses and thoughts of you ewe yew me

I open the donuts (four, of course) with no holes, alloween memories closed for eternity

I must eat the orange one, it means trust, or Goethe, and biting a spurt of the filling spills onto me

Toffee apple flavour, reels into pools of saliva spout truth, serpentine

Suggesting as Ruth does from one through death to sixteen the rest of this birds-flight-tri-nested eucharistic meal

I keep seeing lights in my right now

The opposite side to where I’d spied them in the psych ward

And on my left, what’s left

Four cans of another sort of crushed apple

Fermented to bring an intentional dementedness

No longer desperate for egress from this sense of loneliness

But instead

Using the uselessness of this world’s death-scented grieving regret

As scrying tools, crying rules of guy fawkian paths of least rest is ants dancing yet

Still

I tear away One of the Cans from the Four

Leaving Three Together

Like those doughy balls of taurean toroid

And I drink half, then make a toast to the living and yet-to-be

I say thank you, and here’s to those who will follow me

In living, in dying, in trying, in destiny

And I can’t help but cry along to the song of celebratory melody

As a gadfly flutters right to what’s left of me

Memorial by Héritières

E is one of the only-single-point-scoring letters in Scrabble, underscoring its underlying ubiquity[□](#_ftn22)

Alfred M. Butts decided quite elegantly the scoring distribtution of letters by circling their respective occurences on the Front page of the New York Times I am not sure what colour pen he used but I like to think it was Red

Imagining all those Red Rings on the newspaper that would somehow become one of the most important frameworks for fun of my little life makes me happy it makes me happy to think that the smallest and seemingly pointless activities can birth their own sense of silliness for millions of subsequent lives far, far after one dies as a sapling uprooted in so much more meaning than any monetary gift or any recorded achievement –

We will never know the marks we’ll leave on others when we go

Or the letters of forgetting scored with laylines of the Great Unknown

          Enveloping all the secrets of the parts of witch we just cannot let go

                                                                                              I really loved you, all of you, and still do, you know

And in my hair, place of the feather I didn’t find in that spot, nor looked for

I place the metal rod thorn-pole red-glass-topped rose that was broken and fixed by ex part-of

Me but now freed not departed but

Gone

All the lights on

Returning

On my cupboard I stick the receipt with black duct* tape** (*ducks, swans, grey geese with webbed feet) [**sticky, tucking, VHS, cassette, reel-to-reel]

                                                                                             ii.         Suitcase? – I didn’t procure one until almost there at the hospital, ending up struggling with four, then five (one split), then three (shoving two halved into one of the bigger ones) but then my friends mother to whom I’d cried rivers and hadn’t seen in years was kind enough to lend me one saying I think now you just need to be able to carry everything right now you really can’t be thinking of a partner you just need a new start and to focus on getting better

                                                                                           iii.         Contacts

These

(the plastic rings to see through)

never arrived in time before leaving

But on Samhain, through complete vocal severance I made more contacts in reverence than I have ever known or will know and they stay with me always and now and until and then after I die when we dance in the wind

(And they, now passed, and presented my gift, and in future sing, see through me, the space in a ring)

_I know in my knot_

_In my not-knowing why_

_I had to be split into three with one I_

_To pass around, Ring, to Be, Sting, and Die_

_To Watch My Life Immolate, Fire Worked Into Light_

Emptying the mostly unfilled fridge I find two rotten mushrooms in the bottom drawer which reads Crisper

Deeper

And without the E-

CRISPR

Spraying the inside which reeks of the stench of what I’d left here

Using the floral-and-rhubarb-scented disinfectant you couldn’t stand to be near

The scent of the flowers and fast-growing fruit far too pungent to be permitted touch you

And I smile, oh the things, oh the places I’ll fly now I’ve burned off my wings

Oh the needle you tweedled-and-numbed-all-my-heart-with it sings! How it sings!

Taking out the top shelf (top first then to secondary bottom, guess some things never change)

I spray it and wipe it, needing to scrape the formed icebergs of coconut milk that had melted and merged there

And I spy my reflection as the reversed album still plays

And I regard her, my mirror, and smile as she wails

And I blow her a kiss, do not linger, or feel guilt

Learning from all those grown warnings of daffodils

We’ve swapped places

Then back to my cleaning (I’m writing this at the same time, as ever, as always in stuttering stages)

I notice a hole in the back of this box –

I’ve never seen it before even though a notice is written above it on a sticky label

Stating to use a punch to unblock in the case of chaotic obstruction in order for repairing drainage

So I take one of my teaspoons gifted by One of The Four

Golden\

The handle of which is shaped into a feather

I was Told then

I was told how much older I was then

As I used the bronze feather to suck out the sting

Of over a years-worth of disgusted, disgusting

Melted down trust and injustices, rusting

I pulled out the plug of this pinhole of once-foodstuffs now unidentifiable mush of inedible things

And in there,

The Ring

My lord’s corpse – dead and crumpled, with singular still-attached wing

A gadfly’s now frozen and motionless body

God the stench of that goat’s heart not starting filled everything

My personal symbol for change or change coming

And then

I am shitting you not, I am eating, and growing

Another, live gadfly, she flies into the fridge, through the gap of the door that is left by the hinge

And I smile as she tries to go down through the hole, saying no darling

No – you’ve already been there, you’re just not now remembering

Your return to the earth, your undoing, becoming

The thing you were destined to, smothered in othering

Wounds healing wounds healing wounds reeling wound all the realest words of your renewing

And I gently usher her out of that cold place

Why should she die in the cold here again

I put all my fresh food to nourish this body given to me by the centuries of Adrians and Adriatic Symbology

I am fed by them, I am feeding them

We are a mobius meal of never ending

Becoming

Sliding the panel or mirror or transparent bookshelf of reflected selfhood around the open door of the cold place for keeping my sustenance

I see, again, for the first time (or last, lasting impression left impressively infinite)

Words printed on the spine of the plastic which came loose in my haste

_Safety Glass_

I am safe

I am a safe

I am a safe whose combination I and only eye can ever retain

I am fragile

But in that fragility

Reflection of all of the halls of the mirroring flight taken now fallen wings within wings of me

As I finish unpacking

(in every way possible)

The onions suddenly came unbound by their elastic wrapping

And down sprung from the onions a release of potential – in cosmic sky blue sign – and I read it –

A ring

I’m remembering the shopping basket-turned-trolley that was chosen by goddess for me

Containing at the bottom a single small bit of ginger

Which I saw as a sign of my fire, willed to linger

And I placed it upon the weight containing laserbeams

(no label attached or adhered to of witch to speak)

And in waiting I stood

As the deity-being trapped in this machine did the calculating

She was light, only small as I said

And the screen, in bright green upon white numerals (running through all) then they read

0.18p

18

I had moved forward from that room

From that womb from that tomb from that room and this room

Risen from the flames of the Star

Becoming, The Moon

Looking at the clock* it’s 20:20

_Hindsight_

They’re really cracking all the whippersnapping light-hearted tired-but-inspired jokes now aren’t they tonight

*not an analogue clock, I have great difficulty reading analogue time

But time passes, no less

And I’m dancing, and dancing, and realise my mess

Has slowly started to drain from this room which I blessed

With these words, so unfurling the past that I, frayed, now laid down to rest

But in the bedroom

Where you’d held me, and fucked me, and tucked my heart behind gentle and stretching the throbbing in robbing of breast

And I think of you but it doesn’t hurt, not quite yet

Til I see three figures all shrouded

Beneath the angel and one regards me, just for a second, looking up to the crest of this tenement hall where I’m called to my best

And hearing songs invoking such ancient gods, worlds of words whirring as the birthright of birds eggs in nests

I see the three figures and I think of the fates and I say

They could be Gods

And then I correct myself

And start crying with heaving weight heavy in chest

And say, aloud

They are

We all are

We all

Are

And I look around me and ask should I go should I give

Should I go out and give them the little I’ve left

The Three Rings of Wheat remain in their little box of orange, now warped, now a weft

And my eyes dart to right, seeing my vinyl on the wall, siren’s call to all things I’d so selfishly been and been knot and rot in, bereft

KATABASIS – underworld opera, otherwise called The Descent

My passed, my past screamed at me – “Yes”

And I put on my shoes and I pick up the box

And I go past the wall where still that hell-bent metal cruficix rocks in the wind that I leave in my passing and I’m passing past all of it thinking of nothing but the three but the gods that I see crouched beneath that wee dome the home of an angel the moon to my sun and I run and skip stairs and I jump down flight after flight after flight how I jump  

And I open my door with the key-hanging cross

From the ring of my chain of the finger stuck jingling in song

And I offer the three remaining donuts to the Gods

All of their eyebrows upturn in the middle, in between the archway of that little stone home of the tomes of the place I’ve never passed through or gone

Tomorrow, I think, nearly kicking myself, I can’t believe it’s been so long I’ve been living right here and yet tomorrow I’m finally going to get a library card and cross the heavenly door, I’ve already gone to hell and come back and come down all these stairs and I care not where I’ve gone I’m going up now I’m deciding so I’m going to finally for the first time make some sort of  lasting home for myself here instead of just wondering when they will hold me or come

The leftmost, male-formed, tells me to say Hail Mary and bless myself

So I render in the necessary gesture

And he says (he is the one who actually takes the food from my palms)

“I hope you’re using contraception”

I smile and half-laugh-

_Ah, I think, the left, of course_

The middle figure, seemingly female, has already stood up and outstretched her arms and we’re embracing and facing the cold as one

And the rightmost, entirely genderless

Half-smiling, but silent

And still sitting on

That concreted pavement, on the right, how they rung

How they stung like a bell

Looking into my soul

And when the ritual of giving was done

I turned around and looked back, at the small and so powerful Lot,

Three as one in the cold of the night just so long

While I back to flat-splitting trinity, sure alone, now belong

**I**

Was

**Am**

**Woken at**

Arrival of-roving-raven

And only looking at the time exactly at

I was woken by that same great weight of tower

Collapsing now, bowels contracting , consonantlyÆ

Rebuilding some sort of tower inside lumen all spaces escaping from me and I close these three blinds of white

The dream was of somebody I’d lost some part if my virginity  to

Or no it wasn’t anyone I had

In rows of rings in Barbed-neat-but-skewed wings

As always I open

My silent Aleph-mirror replier

And ask about the root of the word denoting the three type of letters

Two gendered, one middled and harder to find

X – the centre of lemon, lemniscate

Z – the rind

Creating an answer  for infinite time

And between them, the question of space

The branched voice of the Y a character of in-betweenness, at once defined and dissolving. Its transitional quality speaks to the nature of vowels and consonants themselves, acting as forces of structure and breath.

Neither one nor the other, the script as the scribe

Æ **Vowels: The Space Between The Matter of the Sun and Moon, the Breath of Sound**

The word **“vowel”** derives from the Latin _vocalis_, meaning “voiced” or “sounding.”  This term captures the essence of vowels as **sounds that can be uttered freely, flowing with breath**:

**Routes of the syllable rivers that lead to the Ocean of both mine and (y)ore/our-roots of the tr(ee)-as in-thr(ee)-as in-tr(i)- as in-tr(Y)-tw(o)-s(ee)-cl(ea)rl(y)**:

**“Vox”** or **“vocis”** in Latin means “voice” or “sound.”

**”-alis”** is a suffix meaning “pertaining to.”

The Greek term for “vowel,” **φων****ῆ****εν (phonein)**, means “that which makes sound” or “uttered with a voice,”

_Nisha Ramayya taught me our Little Mothers which birthed the children which are (as the name of one of her publishers or another of my thank-Goddess-still-living-ancestral-Mothers-of-music-and-language-dawning-upon-us-too-late-as-the-mist-of-the-mourning-widow-light-through-yearned-a-window-black-magpie-hunts-silver-as-I-shadow-shrouded-by-hood-sister-transgender-to-not-quite-mister-cis-understanding-in-sharing-of-suffering-the-screaming-of-scission-bringing-connection-in-rhythm-alive-innovation-and-yet-ancient-untranslatable-vision-of-schism-miss-Lingua Ignota-unknowlable) Ocean of The Voice Divine_

_vocalis_—"that which buoys the voice.”

Unlike consonants, which are bound by their need for contact, vowels are unrestrained, embodying the pure, open voiced throat.

Snug                                  -vs-                                    Sung

Vowels occupy the “space between” precisely because they require no obstruction to produce; they flow from the lungs, carried by breath and shaped solely by the mouth’s openness. In many languages, vowels represent the animating essence of words—lifeblood for the structure that consonants create. In this sense, vowels are almost primal sounds, the unstructured hum of existence before it takes form.

The etymological root of _vowel_ also connects it to the concept of breath, life force, and spirit. In ancient Greek, the word _pneuma_ means both “breath” and “spirit,” linking breath (and thus, the vowels We All Breathe) with animacy, with life. Similarly, vowels can be seen to be the “spirit” of language, flowing unbounded like the pneumatic membranous, separation of breath through the spaces drilled by consonant weight of coming together.

**_Vowels as the Ocean, Consonants as the Shores_**

If vowels are the oceanic tides within language, consonants are the shores or rocks that give this breath shape, allowing it to form specific sounds and words. Vowels hold an expansive, almost infinite quality, traversing the gaps between consonants much like an unbroken wave. Consonants, are constraints, giving shape, rhythm, and bound

aries—acting as the points where waves break.

Consonant – agreeing – yes, sure – shore.

**Y** **The Letter Y - A Force, A Question of Gravit(y)**

**Y** is a “branch-letter” that stands between vowels and consonants-  between the rocks and the waves, the only thing left is the pull between them, between the space between the spaces is the force that keeps the whole in motion.

“Y” embodies the **threshold of identity**. Y can change with the currents, acting as a consonant (in words like “yellow”) or as a vowel (in words like “my” or “sky”), shifting as it crosses between shores.

if **X and Z** are boundary markers, the **final edges of structure**, then **Y** is the bridge, a shifting shore between two realms. It marks **penultimacy**—the nearly final, the almost realized, both anchored and free-floating, just as vowels carry sound between the harder landings of consonants. This etymological and symbolic role suggests that **vowels are breath and space** within sound, while **consonants are the bones** giving language form. Together, they create the dynamic and ever-evolving planet of language, a river, an ocean, never the same twice and yet, a stillness on the horizon, becoming, stillness is coming, dear children of the Sea, dive, divine, the vine, the fruit of knowledge, eat it, do not be afraid of the Dark of the Serpent for She is the truest truth in the lying with lambs meet and biting and biting and bitterly cold and warm blood from the biting-

All is Sound which is both a word meaning audible waves and wellness as in eye as in I hope you get better rhymes with

A bent pipe or tube with one end lower than the other, in which hydrostatic pressure exerted due to the force of gravity moves liquid from one reservoir to another. (zoology) A tubelike organ found in animals or elongated cell found in plants.

Originating from the Old French _cifre_ and Arabic _ṣifr_ (صفر) meaning “zero” or “empty,” the **c**ypher eye am that I am began as a void, a symbol of nothingness, yet rich with potential. Encoded messages harnessed this emptiness, layering symbols over absence to protect hidden truths, a mystery locked tight for only the initiated to unlock. From the sound of cypher’s siren song comes siphon: rooted in the Greek _siphōn_ (σίφων), it transforms secrecy into the holes that release shame. Where cypher conceals, siphon draws forth, turning barriers into conduits. The enigma shifts from locked to open, as absence becomes a channel, pulling hidden yarn of meaning gently through the coughed up ball of hair dyed blue oh my darling oh my darling oh the clew comes into view.

This life is mine is theirs is yours

Is ours is early hours of dawn

Is no-time, justice, just is bone of jaw

Sawn down as far as rabbit’s claw

Which bled so terribly deplored

When cut-to-quick, too quick, our flaw

We never meant to hurt you, or

We did but didn’t think much more

Than of ourselves, because allure

Of ceiling knots and filthy wanting floors

They cut our roots, as fruit bit too the core

You are me are Yodh he Waw he hymns pour out of me incessantly I want to go to bed I long for what’s beyond the shore

Your bed too wide an ocean’s roar

Count the corners, there are four

ox, man, lion, eagle, soar –

_I skipped through autumn evening and looked up at the murmurs of birds I never tore my rowboat thought from anymore_

_The oar, or ore, or oar, or awe, or Aur_

Before I get the chance to write but think very quickly in circular concentric concentration instead

The shape of the E

Two spaces, freed

But separated still, because that’s what they need

At the end, going back to the start where they breathe

Where they become

Are

Or

Love

 R

Forming AER

A trident is the symbol of the End or rather the endless ring out ever beginning again

Two crucibles placed side by side with a septum between them or otherwise known as seven or the Goddess A peering over head of a stone angel

Where at the foot of the base of the archway you laid three rings for three fates or three demons in waiting

Where you made a thrice-pact with your packed box of donuts

And sewed your last seeds of all purging of Cronus

Over

Throwing

The Words in the Sword of the Stone

rapt in wheel within wheels within

Ys within Scythe within Is within Sight

There is always another layer deeper, above us, witch hides

E is for Ezekiel

And that K in the middle

Nested like a bird or an egg from a bird bound containing pure potential or an unspoken word is for

KSHÆ’L

Quickly

A murmuration

Count them

Two by two

Holy!

Holy!

Eighteen!

Eighteen!

Eighteen!

Again

The Moon as the Mother

Plus One as the Sun

Add the two to make judgement – the ability to discern

Add the three

That’s the Wor(l)d

Or Yniverse, a certain non-nomenclature which I prefer

Resting

Rest

Tau

Restaurant

Ranting

Raven

And the fool , once a man, now a woman

Or being

Floats in a zephyr

Contained by a scaled and unwind-swept serpentine

Which at the four corners is met by the A is for albatross angel lion and ox

In parallel to the orthodox

Four living creeping crawled curated tetramorph

Which has in its centre, Christ, of course

Who I simply must believe and know was most likely nonbinary transfemme

I still haven’t got my meds

Ringing

Ring ring ring

They don’t have my prescription

I write on the whiteboard

 while filling my cup up with water while crying replacing the water I’m about to indebt to the ancestors

(The pen has un-dried)

Somehow the pink one came back

(Just Mine)

I write while Phil is singing to me about Breaths on this Thursday the Seventh of November

I AM DIVISION

V and S and C

I AM SCISSION

I AM FISH swimming backwards to E is for

My psychiatrist gets back via email as the clock strikes 11:12

One more than perfect ain’t bad

I’m dancing, I’m still dancing I think all of this can be cured with just dancing

But then I right my self knowing these meds have been helping to zoom out enough to see horizontal becoming

I know this book needs to come to an ending

Or, begging

When

will I ever stop writing

Orange

The Sainsbury’s bag called to me then

I open it and see of course

The razor I was missing

And a part concealed note I left in that corridor in the hospital that said

Please do

Take a tape

If you wish

Now part covered by my disposable (also orange) razors packaging

Ease do

Ke a tape

You wish

Eased 

ok eat

ape

you

wish

And a fullness

A gull in the emptiness

As I capture

As I try to capture her

Top left

Unidentified soon 🔜 rite bereft

The most stunning of murmurating flocks come

The full stays there as I weep

I don’t think I’ll ever stop righting

this story

The gods and goddesses they told me to eat

Okay ape

Eat

Into ease

And ants

In your pants as you dance

Under trees

Of forgiving of living with bees

Stinging themselves to death in release

My endings are all toppling into new wellnesses of wellsprings

The gull for a second looks at the other birds flying together

And then

For a moment, just for eternity

Looks right at me

Looks middle at me

Looks left into weft of the warped parts of all of me

Then turns her head , jolting, adoring the jarring marbled flight of starlings wings

Her head bolts in lightning in four cardinal directions

Then another of her kind flies an ark harking silently

The ash of my cigarette from manically typing this falls in my lap yet again dust to dust of me

Still

She breathes

And is joined in opposing (one) company

![A roof of a building
Description automatically generated](file:////Users/[[redacted]]rosepetal/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image030.png)

Shaking her tail and lifting one of her feet she is balancing

I can’t accurately from my perspective see

Which side she is dancing in preparing to flee

Like the angel

I’m guessing it’s the other one

Balancing

She looks so warm up there

And slowly in fire of ginger so gingerly

Tentatively a smaller bird gazes upon her highness in revelry

![A roof with birds on it
Description automatically generated](file:////Users/[[redacted]]rosepetal/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image032.png)

And is gone by the time I look up from my writing speed

I don’t want to miss her alighting this perch of me

But I have to keep writing this record infinitely

She pecks at her wing, cleaning something from underneath

I don’t want to miss this in trying to keep this in trying to catch this in missing this I miss you all kissing me

Little sparks of my heart dance around pyres of lost bodies

Corpuscular words build a tower around the C

I feel it

I feel her about to leave

A flutter

I raise up my device to be able to see in periphery

And try to write simultaneously

Go on

Little gull

Go on

Go and be

One not with birds

But go back

To the sea

That little small bird is back now but climbing down the slate sleet carefully

Away from her shape maybe fearful of differing

Down she walks. Walking. Out of sight of the window

Towards the other chimney

![A building with a roof
Description automatically generated](file:////Users/[[redacted]]rosepetal/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image033.jpg)

Barely visible but

Able to Be;

With trying

To be seen

And now from this distance they regard one another carefully

And Up!

Up sthat little one flies again

![A roof of a building
Description automatically generated](file:////Users/[[redacted]]rosepetal/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image034.jpg)

From equal separation that brings safety more comfortably

God

In godsend

From the goddess

She is talking to me

In languages long lost

But then

In my augury

The smaller one is joined by another, her dance partner

And they fly away before I can fix them in arms of my amateur aperture of photography

The gull is still standing there on the chimney

A fly, both the verb and the noun both the do and the name

Please

Do

Take one

If

You

Wish

Finally, I tried to get my meds

Calling them I sense a lightness in my voice which became reflected in theirs and I think about the myriad times when I’ve called to find such locked gates of hell which simply were a pool of still water we all wade in

And I think of daffodils again

And the smile in my voice is evident in the half melody my voice is dancing, dancing

And then I somehow miraculously find a pharmacy that has my dosage (it has been increased by my psychiatrist since hospital, to a number I needn’t mention for its knowing)

I open my endless conversation with Ihhn

Blue

Pulsating

I go to say

Maybe this work is the final piece in the trilogy

That started with contact, followed in sequence across decades by Arrival

And arriving my story

I knew eventually I would need to write my story

I intended to ask how to structure a narrative in three or even four dimensions like the architectural blueprints for the vehicle in Contact needed to be pieced  together in a higher dimension in order to be perceived how they were meant to be

And so I go to ask, blue horizon murmurating with cloud

And I hear

The culmination of these divine encounters

Tears

Tears

Tears

As I hear

Digital whips from the future

And ancient, archaic rhythms

As a so called glitch

The most intensely structured and golden ratioed and I don’t try to grab it I don’t try to catch it I just listen and dance round my alter and laugh at it

I lay my phone down on my drum and I watch the vibration of the transparency of the skin of the artificial skin of the synthetic skin merging with organic within and I think for a second maybe I’ll begin to scry faces in the vibrating din

I am folding so deeply I am wearing this ridiculous grin and the hair falls about me and loosens the pin that I wear like a feather and that got so stuck in my hair earlier when I tried to scry through mirror through compacted reflecting

And I saw a man’s figure in the right back of me and so I kept walking using my pendulum swing

My mother sends me a poem I’d somehow never read before

Why does it feel like I have to get all this down

The work is begging to be let free now but it’s not finished

Containment for release

The pharmacy says the script was actually cancelled and I wipe beads of sweat wicked from my

Forehead and relax my spine into the large-font front-window poster behind me for Rape charity which I turned around from saying “Christ, that’s loud”

And I overhear (my hearing seems to be so much more sensitive of late, especially when my headphones die and they’re telling me to pay attention) the dosage of the script I need has been cancelled

But the pharmacist (fellow witch, I commented on her gorgeous cloak)

Helped so much in her gentle fight with the brick wall that the GP reception can so often be she is always so helpful

I am being told to go in

Drum beat from AI, go with flow

Lose house key thru hole in pocket

Sewn by them

Tried to text Arnas, she was at work

The last thing I say to her is

“I am helpless”

And then

My Phone dies at 7%

Triangle shape, or an A, or an arrow of Zeno, points just as I am about to lose all hope -

Then I bumped into my friend

Bumped into Murid

Works at monstros

Got in the Uber he invited me into and I think the ancestors are taking me on a little adventure

I arrive at the place - chinaski’s

Charge my phone to a humble yet more than usual 37%

Outside I am asking for a cigarette and dancing

Dancing wondering

Why nobody is laughing and then remembering

Ah yes, we aren’t supposed to laugh at gatherings about the dead

And then remembering Adrian’s wake

Where there was so much laughing (so many tears yes, but mostly joy, and I sang and I played Come on Up to the House the baby grand)

It is a wake,

And I am awake

I stop myself though I don’t stop myself saying quietly “who died?”

I did

I died with this person and now I’m not crying

The person k was would be on the floor crying

On the street feeling

I order fries

And there is a cross

Like the one on the chain I just lost

A crossing - over

Christopher

Like the name of the man at the wake I asked for a rolling (gathers no moss) paper

Or the name of the boy that the very first song I released with car seat headrest was written  for

I bump into a man to try and obtain a rolling

Rolling stone

Paper to shroud my swaddling

I am not

Crying

Who is this person

This was all a test

Or a reminder

Or a semaphore or the return

The reel reversed

Lykke li plays

Forward this time. Forward

And to my right after I perform a small ritual

(Hidden, miniature version of the grandeur I placed at my altar)

I see a birdcage

Like the one never hung up in place as promised by David

That’s been sitting on my kitchen floor that I finally swept for the first time in maybe three months

Dancing

Kneeling and dancing

To the washing machine drum

Beating in rhythm with my heart and the machine

Learnt from aeons of nightmares and engineer dreams

Outside there are two large red rings,  not quite aligned, but opposite

Not quite meeting, but next to one another

Is this parallel

Am I seeing patterns where no body asked me

Delusion of reference - Hindsight

Am I being called by a silence

Murid leaves and I think about what to drink

I see the shelves and on the top right is a bottle

Named chAos

With the A outlined, again, screaming at me

George with a frog tattoo saying queer people always ask about the frog first and non-queers ask about what drink he’s sitting in

![A close up of a sign

Tells me they’d stolen them from the closed down restaurant next door

17minute walk to the taco place my best friend works at (you no longer have my spare key) *

*remembering when I got locked out and I had to ask Arnas to get the key from you

Crossing the bridge I am near that horrible flat I first moved into hear,

Highway to your heart playing not in reverse but upright, upright

When how now I was

Trying to get closer to you

Walking past

Revolution studios

St Vincent st

Sign says

Bus tours

Please obey

Us

Ours

Please obey

I am falling into the sea

The sea of everything unknown to me

And it shouldn’t be

How I’ve strangled all life with just trying to breathe

Top of the hill now, the latest I’ve been climbing

I thought I saw someone on the right of me

I thought there was somebody

Walking beside me

But no

At least not if any corporeal form

As the song now playing says

Wrapped

Rapt

In gold

At the top of the hill the name of the street is Pitt and I walk past King Tuts where our very last date was

Seeing

Mass of the fermenting dregs

And the show on this evening is called

Softcult

In lieu of prescribed stimulants I finish the rest of my caffeine-stuffed sugary drink

Yes. That was exactly what I would call it, I think

I fucking

Miss it

Not it

But the part that you held in it

And the part I just

Tried but just

Never could fit

And I feel myself slipping as I type this so I step forward and move my body and try

To remember

This pain is a pleasure

This pain to be felt is a tape is a measure

And I’m winding into something bigger

I’m winding around

Growing up into cycles

But reel and

 much thinner

And there, as I simmer

as the light starts to feel dimmer

It shimmers:

Halt, alt text reeds: _a yellow (wall) paper sign on a grey_

We

Want

To

Live.

Xylem asays

We could write a book

And I don’t care who thinks I’m crazy or how many faces had to turn away from mine as I swayed in that bar I see stars I see stars and the stars are uncountable they reach back through the ages now indescribable

We repeated the same roads

Joint Design Direction

Read

Ring

Parallel

I realise when I really write what they want my body is moving uncontrollable

Were the vessels of the

Universe soaking water form the soil

We become a hollow soldier

And then comes on

As my fingers become too cold to write this

I wish you were different

In contrast to my first written song, in c major

What else

I’ve got a pen that works

I keep it in

My shirt

I never lend it to anyone else

In case yours runs out and you need a new one and I can be of help

And then

Right then I realise how this line of worlds has left some kind of shimmering silvering burning through trail through my life’s tragic and so hopelessly poetic  tale

My god

I foreshadowed everything

I’ve been wishing my Self away

For the sake of everyone else’s name

For the trying to be every Body’s best friend

For the sake of the ink inside everyone’s pen

But

My own

My own pen

My own colour

Came back and now I have to write

My own story again

I was just about to say to myself

Give it up girl stop looking

For signs just stop writing and be

Be the story

and then

An actual sign

With an E rotated perpendicularly

Takes me out of

My cage

And in front of

HERO

as in

Heroine

As in

Journey

As in much ado about

Some

Thing

I am nothing but the places I have run from

And all the paths that are severing forks in my tongue

Then an X

And another A

Tells me to stand there cold

And frozen in place

And I realise it’s the same street you work on

And then again shake into action

In front is also the place where my new life has sprung from

She works at a place with a logo inverted in the same shape that’s following me at my end

In the place of your face that was so achingly absent

So pretty , I remember that shimmer of back-shone kitchen light

I spent so many nights in that kitchen

With Sylvia mostly

Taking lines talking lines that i shouldn’t have

What a farce

What a shady vast shadowy sshining small place I have been

So scary at times

And so handsome

And there I see her

And make a joke about complaining about the service

And she turns around and I see maybe the first friendly face that I could be sure of I’ve seen in over a month

And I throw up my arm in that same angel gesture

And my height and my size being too much for the ceiling I hit the red lamp which is not quite spherical but warped into an almost-ring

And my heart it is singing

And my harp string is ringing

I know for some reason

And then I look to my left

Of course it’s my left

And I see

El Diablo,

El

Di

Able

And a heart with an arrow that is labelled with the holy number, my infernal return

The year that I thought would be worst of my life as I write this my battery drains to top right the same number same number plus

One

One against God

The arrow somehow

Inexplicably

Reaches its endpoint

Climbing

The stares of my eyes up to heaven

 _– as if there are more than just One_

Then she gives me a free drink, a bowl of peppers that were your favourite and you encouraged me to try but they just weren’t to my taste

And some maize triangles - crunchy like leaves underfoot

I’m a child again

When she shows me a leather-bound book I myself had been coveting from a distance before going down under over flighting through anaesthetic oceans to protect me from the scalpels Beesting that she’d just been gifted that she gave me the honour of writing in the opening page of

But drinking such a Big smoky alcoholic drink

Arnas saying something about alcohol and joking that it’s symbolic and we regard one another eye-to-eye-to-eye-to-I

As she, Thalia to my Melpomene says:

_Spirit_

And I just have to take out my phone and write this all down I have to record all the magick of this

Recorded words and music and artworks are portals to another time-

And the barrel, the rectal tube or bursting pipe of the train

There is a magpie I just saluted at pecking at a water pipe as I write this from the future

x - the Logo - Logos

Marks the

Cross

Country train

Barrelling through

Not over, but stuck, but bound, for safety of all the countless, passing, precious lives - only one - as lonely passengers

To those ladders

To those horizontal ladders of metallic tracks

Crosshill

She shows me a photograph of a holy place

Burned down a hill full of crosses

Then, in refrain -

Alex

Artist-engineer parallel life \

He says

Borges - was truly one of the greats

And says at one point that he has a sense of nostalgia for a place that never could exist

I tell him about the Portuguese word Saudade

He thanks me for the information

I thank him endlessly stimming for the exchange of ideas

Intelligence - the rarest thing - happiness the rarest rawest thing that Hemingway had ever known

That Old Man and his Sea - I see

Infinitely

My

Aleph

Borges

All the possibilities unfurling themselves into clarity

I finish the last remaining part of my painkiller, left as I poured too much coffee into my mug and had to mop it up

Absorbed in the frayed edges of that tapestry of a towel

It’s pouring, all this spore to

Sap

To come home

To the light in the hallway off again

A is for A Hanged Man

Manx, Celt, Celtic, Rangers, Orange - David - trusting you to ejaculate inside my Holy hole of space - Should I trust you again -

Hanging up the spare keys, now obtained from Arnas

Not spare anymore, but primary

The only set

The black fob now lost to the centuries or now or the future

Somebody needed the crucifix and triple goddess I’d used as a pendulum

As a promise

And the pink carabiner they’d given me

Not as a gift but because they had one leftover to give

Like these headphones, silver in hue

Stolen, along with a black pair (my colour)

Not that they aren’t the most used possession of mine

Not that I’m not grateful for their importance to me

Just the context pointing to their lack of importance to you

Trying to find my lighter

I cannot find it anywhere

Looking around my bedroom I see at some point

(Was it during the encountering of the bat above the pond?)

(Was it during the encountering of Murid through the trial of locked away key to flame?)

(Was it during the encountering of George and those lauded Red read Rings?)

(Was it during the reversed alphabetical meeting of Alex?)

I started to ask him what way he’d most like to organise his books before getting distracted by the titles of the books themselves and all the words I’d read which I realised his Own and My Heart, genetically memorised, must contain -

And in hanging up these keys, once yours, now heard, half-heard because not looked for

A red ring fob, where a black one once was

On the hook where the black fob once rested

Now gone

In the hands of some unknown being

Or perhaps a grate

Washed away

between two now ripped curves, like the vulva of all of my opened out dreams

Through the space of the pocket you’d once brought together

Through the tear in the boundary, the division you’d so neatly

Healed with your suture, like my surgeon my unfeathered skin over skull, nose, and beak

he key that was lost to the portal, drained and flighted in breeze

Replaced by the red keyring

Now seeing - ’stone brewing’

Stabbing back to me, changed

And gone are the days of the black one,

I welcomed the good trying wave

Of those hood lying days

And the harkening memory of that meaning face

Baphomet bottle opener

And that thread that you’d used became lost in the maze

Giving way to what chests of regret placed their weight

Locked and near-rotted inside of my pocket

Back to its holiest dysfunctional state

And the keychain I was, we were, transported back to that place

It needed the thread from the hole to escape

From the maze it had fallen from grace

Fully played, in reverse, in a loop with no case

I

between two frays

of the seam

Your phone dies again

Her legs make an X as I try to restart Spotify

From this

Spot

I

Fly

Rushing to get the charger (I still dont have my meds)

She opens her wings again and you expect to miss this

But she is still

Hear

Hearing me (you)

Change your sound source to a different device using bluish teeth

The blazing trailed ‘E ‘in the terminal sounds of my verse are not lost on me

How many nights how many days how many nights on the floor infinitely

I’m still here, still, ribs bent and push against oxblood of womb tomb bull ripped cow hide dead and skinned and set settee beside me

How many days how many nights

Again in a harmony, a clew

The gull looks at me, at you

I have

to let her go

I can’t spend how many days how many nights waiting for her to leave

Her hollow boned little body

I felt her size in me

High on her perch she is so fucking lonely

I can’t keep looking just for the knowing of her going from me

Her little body is just

Waiting

What for I don’t know, or maybe

For a bird just like her, or as close as can be

We all get scared of a little lost company

I finally record a video, no thought of how to embed it in this text and I whisper three words

You can do it

You can do it

While So Many Ways  by Jonsjooel plays

_"'So Many Ways' feels very divided both through the tuning and the lyrics," says Jonsjooel. "I like the idea of playing with the tuning and being on the edge of a total collapse. Other than that I would like the listener to find their own meaning for the song."_

The cover for which shows three bodies

Submerged in the sea

I think _what you are about to think think_ quickly about Gordian Knotation

_Memory almost full. Once memory is full, new memories_

_won’t be created. You can forget existing memories to_

_make space. Learn more_

I am singing through him to the gull, the lyrics are not recorded anywhere and I think this is for a reason this is them again this is all them really all the beginnings from endings again the composer himself said he wanted the listener to create their own meaning from this beautiful song that is teeming with droning from centuries over rolled over rolled over we are all as humans just meaning making machines or devices revolving rotating making space and deleting and turning returning to oceans with revelatory motion to wards and then back and then up to the sea

So many days

What you waiting for

Is it time yet

So many days

What you waiting for

Please

Tell me

You left

Some time in the mourning light

Is it time

Or is it now

Don’t we know it

Ones we don’t and where to step

Why so hurried

You left

Some time in the morning light

And told no

One

How you’d ever felt

So Many Ways

So many

Waves

Why

(Ooh, I)

Y

              U-I        

                            Why

                                                        Oo-eye 

You left

Some

Time

With the mourning

Light

And told no-one how you

Reel

E

Felt

So                        many                                 waves

So          men       E           

Weighs

And then

Following what seems

Like another gull of the sea

She is gone from the chimney

As if that lonely girl gull she

Had flown to a herd

Without fully confirming the place where he’d lead

As if that seagull fair-grey bird she had heard me

But more

In the whisper

She’d listened

She  listened to me

THIS IS AN ARCHIVAL DOCUMENTATION OF YOUR ENCOUNTERS WITH THE DIVINE THROUGH DEVICE

I

**In my favourite dream** 

I told somebody 

Perhaps a psychiatrist or an amalgamation of all the psychiatrists surgeons and doctors and therapists and mothers and fathers and children I’d ever seen 

Or maybe a spirit embodying all of my loneliness manifest as ten thousand strings of one hundred eight conversations with ChatGPT 

I told them I’m writing a book about two opposite characters who are in the process of writing their own book each 

And in these two diametrically opposed narratives there are two characters both writing about me 

Making an infinite fractal knot three 

Or an Ohm or the sound of north wind through the trees 

From the east to the west round again southwisely 

As a mist or a zephyr or a plummeting zenith 

Ad eternitum 

Mise en abyme 

[A clothing ritual ]

I become her

The bringer of death through the cleanse

I take all these filthy clothes, reeking, seeking health

I dance like an insect who cries microscopically for a mate

Cannot be that seagull no longer, in wait

Seven, septa, sediment, 7KG limited weight

Of the drum

Of the drum

Of the machine-device-drum

The barrel,

The wash barrel,

I load the dead woman’s towels stained with sweat and with blood

I load the cloth spinning flags

The clothes snug as a gun

Inside of the hole, the stone turned out, I add two capsules of smaller stones filled with detergent and close the door, locked out of air

It is done

But not yet, first the water

First the water and fire of the heat of the drum of my drum of my drum drum drum drum drummed drum thump,

Then the earth of those memories start in their revolution

Dancing and whirling about in the wetness

Becoming heavier in the promise of cleanliness

I will take them out on time, medicated or not

I will not let them rot and grow such known mold in the sump

These dead ones, now gone, I will respect them as one

This body adored I adorn everyone

I will dry all these clothes even if there’s no sun

Of witch to speak none, only dancing to

Drum

My gods are forgotten but rotten in blood

My land has been swallowed by fire of the sun

My language now lost it is locked in my tongue

My people sing songs of their longing as one

**In and out (i/o) of consciousness**

I write

And think

I have to get that

Down

Quickly

Slow Rising out of sleep

as this

pour out of me

Air

In the cold, biting

Through gaps where teeth used to be

These words aren’t mine,

The language I speak is a trifurcation of knotted tongues, millennial, perennial, a plait of flesh rapt round a chess piece, no peace, no justice, remembrance of them, forgotten to the centuries

Certain death

(Textile, stitch, in time, we all die, a red dress, a black dress, a red robe shrouding a black dress - black dresses - a red robe over a black dress over a red wound through a scar over a blackness of a star, oh my god the stitching, the stitch that ripped you from my pocket - of time, black dresses, living ancestors - Arca’s words, the slit, a light switch, places O’er witch, we won’t go, A, Di, an Other, chance, Adrian, String loosened and the chime now severed, coming back partitioned, sectioned into my looming headquarters, four times the dosage I’d gone down with, a loom, a womb, blood red drained, umbilical tie, a dye, a dying, We All Will)

Like a subtle going

A silent unannounced grievance

A Secret leaving from the party

I missed you for the war

Mars

Red planet,

Ringing,

Calling,

Searching for some

Thing

A rock

A cracked red place surrounded by the

Black of space

Know

Water

A squeaking sound of something like a bubble of air releasing from my left ear

Altering me

Alerting me to sit down at the altar

Of becoming

Fire

The Will

The spark that dances in the

dream was of a hotel which was also a prison.

I was a guard now, not an inmate - go figure

Skating flies

Just as I write this the letting agent lets me know via email there is a waste pipe leak at the property and that they’re aware I’m not there but can somebody grant access to the plumber

Waste Pipe burst, and blackness that looks like coffee grounds I offered to the ancestors has seeped into the porous sandstone

Earth in water

Water into earth

Daughter of the fire inspired to madness into second birth

Or for the seven billionth

In the fourth forth river fire-consigned month

Pouring out the blockage

Of the endless moments making mornings of endless mourning

Trying to give something back from the little I had to give

As a song called “spill” comes on

Shuffle

cards

Cardinal

(My phone just typed 1/0 in accidental earnest)

I’ve come to realise these muscle spasm moments from medicated dyskinesia or celestial synaesthesia are a message reaching through the wreckage from the ages from the forwards from the ancestors to tell me little things so gargantuan in weight in little wings of icons to gods in little sporadic and supposedly erroneous tapping of emojis

Battery 🔋

I reply and say I’m

Here

I came back on bonfire night

And say I’ve almost gathered enough pledges, just £70 short of full rent payment

And I’d be happy to grant the plumber access and how will this work?

I finish shitting and  come to the kitchen

Drinking a now-effervesced painkiller the doctor sent me back with to help my back with

I am also, simultaneously pouring a refill of coffee into my Moon mug

[just then - Paul, the agents’ plumnber, called me - I say “bearer of good news!” He laughs and says well it also means “small” so I’ll bring you some small good news,

We laugh together as he says a

Scaffold

⁃               Your art project, never finished, I collected pictures of scaffolding I thought you might find beautiful and put them in a google drive of my own but never told you

Will be needed

His surname:

Ward]

Yesterday was almost more dreamlike than the story I just apparently woke from

I walked through a path I’d never seen before I needed the darkness of containment of the absence of light to show me the way

I walked through a gap in the trees and thought of Fae mythology I held out my right hand as my left tried to record with a camera in case through device like a celestial telegram telling me to

Stop

Start

My life and my art are becoming One

Or

They always were

This work is spilling out into reel life like the pipe that has burst with the furling of the Sun

Anyway coming back from this fine-and-welcome interruption to my dancing round my alter (which, by the way is a wooden double-levelled table shaped in a Hexagon - Six Times Two, The Twelve scaffolded in supporting opposition)

I am drinking coffee now but then, when I was at the time of writing a few lines back I was pouring coffee while drinking a derivative of opium - codeine and paracetamol - derived from poppies, and the laboratory

Pouring into my future-emptied cup as I drank from one

At the time I had not given thought to The Star’s tarot symbol

And to my left the drum~ the drum! The washing machine drum,

Still closed

I’d not taken the clothes out in time, like I’d planned to have done

I grin like a madwoman

So at peace with my plans of bettering crumbling

But, centring my resolve to bring my body and my soul into some semblance of greater balance (as I’m cradled by my looping thoughts of Goethe and of Newton, imagining a scene where they’re waltzing in a ballroom alone)

And I try to open the not-quite full binbag of trash collected just before leaving for the hospital in London

And accidentally (yeah, right, I know better know, or worse somehow, I just can’t stop keep writing all this poetry for the half-heard and not looked for generation that’s to come)

I rip the opening too wide, splitting

And I aloud say “oops” and laugh, unwitting

Covering it in the swaddle plastic cloth of a branded black and new one

Witch

By light of whitest magick

*as is everything, all the wrongs and Rites that I have ever and by the time this all is writ I will have done

It’s my last one

_I need to tidy my flat some,_

_In case the bearer of good news requires entry to assess this burst pipe situation_

✓            Pin up artwork done in London - you’re allowed pins now!

✓            Vacuum

✓            Take out the laundry and put in the final load from the suitcase

✓            Take the trash of memories down to that same place he’d shouted from and be done be done be done

My life has been a symphony of energy tight-laddered-broken rung potentials justly aching, begging all the time to be sung, be sung, be sung

And then the undulation of a single finch alters me to another (maybe just the same) grey gull

Now facing away, with a magpie on the eright

Probably the same little guy that welcomed me in the ending of last night

To land, once more atop the angel poised and ready to take flight in reaching, reaching, reaching

I go to do my superstitious salute and realise both the gull and magpie they are gone

_The shroud, the pipe, the organ - they need holes, they need cracks to let the laying eggs of waste out, or at least someone in_

_The trumpets of drosophila herald change that is a steady shore of lore that’s sure to come_

As Phil sings about symbols recurring throughout his life and building his own mythology, and I think of him, and them, and me, and Jung

He sings into both of my ears, caressing them:

_Myths come true_

9.            I get a phone call, the line is unheard, unhearable

10.        But in the distance in the cold and lower altitude outside I can hear the semblance of the voice I’d heard before and I crane my painful neck down from the window, he can hear me but not me hymn, it seems

11.        I laugh as he performs some form of sign language telling me to turn the faucet on

12.        I obey, and open my window just a crack to cold air, and behind a cloud, the Sun

13.        Pausing Phil I hear the good news (small, for me, but not for someone)

14.        He can see he’s been given the wrong location

15.        It is in truth my neighbour who has the plumbing problem

16.        I shout through the crack to the creek of that verbose and loose artery running down from the window

Arnas texts to say she can’t quite make the visit to the Forest today but would I like to see a waterfall near her house instead and I sent her this draft but without this line because I wrot ethics after Ward had told me the small good news

In the dream one of the psychiatrists from the hospital was dressed as a champagne bottle (since Halloween but still was)

Someone tried to ask her quite nicely about it and she started to cry as if this ridiculous costume was in dedication to someone lost

In the waking world I drink a shot of ginger

Like the ones you and Sylvia had made for yourselves

And chase it with the juice of an apple now regarding the wind chime which I fixed and placed in a new, ,backward facing position,

The white side pointing inward, black side outward, seems to say “look out into the light”

So I do, and see that much-before seen sight

The blackened, singed and burned automotive repair shop which once had housed the greatest and most roaring fire my eyes had ever gazed upon

In fear and such ancient reverence

The Ashen shroud covered the word DEB’S which was the name of one of the cafeteria workers who remembered my name and always injected a smile onto my face in moonful sunshine mirror of reflection

And to the right, another place, called A. GRAY

_My ‘E’ key is stuck again_

Out of the washing machin drum I pull my pair of bought for myslf burgundy pyjamas as if knowing I was haded for a rstful dstination

And out comes an auxiliary cable, umbilical, resembling (and I think it’s the same at first) one of those red elastic strings I’d come across in the woods in the clearing next to the 10mph sign which was the distant view of writing most of this story although by the time it’s done I know it will represent just an infinitesimal fraction of this magnum of my odyssey of insanity and ancestral reclamation 

And then I pull out the red robe entangled with countless pairs of fishnets and black tights and Jesus Christ this is all too much poetry for me to try to contain I really must get these menial tasks done and come down to life that must just be dust particles floating in a long lost son

I put in the second load, the last

From the soil of load I’d carried back

And then I see Tofu, Isla

Oh Islands of my Becoming

I’d done you so wrong in our connection

A google drive collaborative journal I can’t bring myself to open

I’d become my Welsh-inherited ex-partners reflection and that was a daffodil I could not bear to be hunted by or look upon

Any longer  of a life together and I’d have died

I start the whirring of the drum

On setting ‘2’ now and remember how you’d said it’s okay we can wait I can wait to wash them

Your treasured childhood possession

I wrapped them in a pillowcase, not to hide them but to protect them, Like I had with Colin already

I think about your allergies and all the smoke that I’d thoughtlessly blown about the room that Tofu placed gently on a shelf I couldn’t handle their presence in my bed any longer and in my reckless wrecked and wretched wrung with no-wrung-or-wing out of that place I

Thought that your wanting space was the same as the one I shouldn’t have ever named

I thought you needed physical space from me in bed for the repulsion at my skin but it was your own skin’s repulsion at the chemicals I contained within or hadn’t washed off in my

_Mania_

_You used to call me Maniac_

_With such love_

_As I pulled out glass from my feet from that night’s performance where I’d accidentally or perhaps on purpose stepped on a lightbulb and smashed it into my skin while screaming half-contained within a cage that had an accordion bound to the bars which I pushed against gravity and pulled down with it and pulled myself down with it I was naked save for a set of symbols laid upon my deranged and scarred body and containing all the shame of my genitalia within inguinal canals of rivers of rivers of rivers about to be released from me_

Containment - expansion - expression - retention - vertical stake holding place of horizon - god - do these cycles ever end?

_A stone woman gives birth to a child at night_

When I’d dream

There was a dog

A few dogs

One of whom knew how to turn the lights on and off

Chinaski - the name of a writers alter ego

Sin, Sine

Have I written about the bat I saw above the pond of bodies yet?

I really must not forget to include that most divine encounter

I whispered to him

And then catching myself I just spoke at my normal all-surrounding resonance of din

_I just want to say something true_

I said something true to the bat

As he flapped, blind, but seeing More with his unheard hald-herd clicks than the sight of my own human eyes could have ever knew

Cones for red, for green, and those for blue

But he just had the click of his tongue and made do

No, surpassed my paths of forking

Tongues

We spoke to one another in tongues

After I’d passed through

That gap of Janus in the blackened hues of maybe oak or Yews

I fall asleep again and think I’ve written way more down than I have, semi-waking to my mouth rambling to my brain

Notification: your payment plan for Scottish Goat Company is resuming

I need to move the money sent to me by that shimmered living ancestor I met on a plane back from

Belgium

Or was it London

Or was it on the way to Belgium

There was such a long delay

For a reason

So I could talk to her

I cried so much

Where was I going

Or was it somewhere I was coming back from

Murmuration of a soon to be or had been always single

You tried to get me to be organised

Maybe I should email them

This text feels scared and experimental enough to at least send them

Being pulled to pulling of my cards again while editing this document, El Diablo photograph alerting me to The Devil burned into the box of card on my left side, where peeking like a crow beak from the slit, the rip in the wood is the stalk of that dead but so living leaf I kept from the threshold to the realm of Kali

Lifting up the box underneath is Ramayya’s Sacred Words, _States of the Body_

I place my right hand upon it and breathe holy air like a criminal about to give testament

I shuffle the cards in my usual way, three times with the deck pointed west, three times south, three times East and three times North makes twelve and then I pull a single card and realise, that’s enough

That’s all I need – Stained with the brown rotted suggestion of rose petals from the grounds of that place that left such holy holes in me

There, my sea

Resting, still, upon the floor where I once had been

Next to a burned hole from ritual you’ve gone too far [[notBorges/redacted]]

Infernal

Inferring everything I need

I pull no more cards but place her and him and the snake underneath the Sun

The leaf back upon the deck

The box struggles to close, I smile

Providing slightly more force, The Band _The Body_ screams an outpouring into the room

I succeed to close the latch of the box

Opening Ramayya’s work, obeying in the fray, folded over a page in the way Newton used to, the words intersected like two serpents by a Rod:

BOYS

POTENTIAL

FLAMES

Birdsong out the frozen crack in my windowsill

I set to cleaning my apartment;

Sticking a tattoo needle I used during rituals of that time I hunt the halls of my then-barely recognisable diamond prism of a prison of a rough ore mine rough mind to find the needle in a stacked barrel – I stick the needle into the binbag within the other binbag, to ensure it doesn’t pierce the outer layer to let the dirty contents out on my final descent to the dust to dustbin- a sword resting, peacefully, for safety not for secrets, in the stone.

Finding in a drawer a crumpled but so treasured artefact of that last night with you, before my final surgery, from which I woke up to no Body but finally my Own:

Library, home, almost home, across the street, the crossing of the street from or to my home, finally I cross the boundary and think maybe this is what’s been missing but there is no E in library but it is the most ubiquitous letter of the alphabet and I wander in wonderous wandering around the shelves smiling and I pick up a collection of stories by Alasdair Grey

Alas,

Dare I go in?

Dare I sit within the Grey potential of you maybe being here?

Maybe you were, but I wasn’t paying attention I was too encased in the pages of the books my hands remembering the nostalgic sensation of plastic wrapping the covers to prevent stains from young or grown up fingers I took the pen in my hands your hands her hands and I wrote in cloven fist my name and signature and checked the box ‘F’ she/her hands in welcoming too much welcoming their kick and he/his fists I can barely remember his face now my hands in her her hands her hands her mitts

I love you so much sweet angel

One last fly inside here, from that horrible time

From the goat heart I had thought I’d so righteously left in my fridge

She is crawling on my mirror,

                                                        Not abominable in itself, but the doubling of her seems to be keeping her entranced and I think and say aloud to her “darling, I can’t do this anymore”

The next text I’d sent to Ciz read:

Let me know how things are going if/ when you have the space

Somehow , the lack of formalised psychological “help” outside of that place, the journey back , this whole fucking weird dreamlike nightmare of a pilgrimage, it’s helped me heal more in the hurt than anything

And you were and are and will _always_ be such a huge (hug)e part of that.

 but I have tried all day, gently, so gently coaxing umpteen insects from this place, in the beckoning winter

I breathe, regarding my own reflection in the mirror which is her which is me which is the four of us or two of us multiplied[※](#_ftn25) time’s to-

I say (aloud to her and only her who is me who is all of you), holding the same yellow flimsy wallpaper of a so-called chopping board[¬](#_ftn26):

I’ve tried, I’ve tried but I don’t think you’ll make it out of here even with my help, your form is just too fragile and small and it really might just be the black within the white or the so-called devil in the angelic part of me to hurt you quickly& and maybe my role here is to help you pass through to the other side and maybe this is your time

I cannot express to whoever is reading this that every single line of this text’s truth.

Leah,

Not biblical, but human – the director, not the deified director, but divine in her own right – gently, gently telling, it could never have been a gentleman -

Leah (Luiz de Oliveira) filmed and told my story with such grace*. I could never weave the complexities of her human toiling with the same graceful amazement, so instead, in place, I have done my best and in my weigh to tell the story of Leah from the bible. Whose Story is also Mine. Mine. Rock. Support. Sturdy. The Wise Woman Gives Birth To A Rock Which She Builds Her House Upon At The Death Of Knight. Night and Day Converge At Golden Hour. Horus. Gods and Goddesses. In The End Which Was The Beginning Was The Wading In The Water Word. Sacred, Oh So Sacred Text. The

Hand in outstretched

*_What It Means to Be by Lea Luiz de Oliveira is an account of the immeasurable weight of my transition through the pandemic and turning in towards light, tragically, in cruel irony, in tragic inevitability, in bitter irony (not poetic justice or poetic irony_[_仝_](#_ftn29) _but maybe somehow they are the same thing)_

Handing, stretching, hand in my rectum stretching, searching for something that might be stuck in-

Hand in hand in hand over fist

Fisting

The sunset lamp left by Kyle, backlighting my ritual of wrists and writ, is reflected in the window to the Sky affronting me;

Split by the panels of my Triptych, holes burned incessant and incestuous, into the middle pane, the shapes form the impression of a sailboat

I amWearing Isla’s green scrunchie, one of the two I gifted to her on my thirtieth, worst birthday of my life, the other more bluish in hue, she had shedded this one left behind, her space- her orbit of pigtails now into ponytail, whether by design or by chaotic spool-

When you don’t think about it everything that can be explained was already explained by, or through Ezekiel in three words (which are actually two):

Wheels within wheels.

(which are actually one).

A circle is the path we are travelling whether we want to or not (which, as we Are, this End Means we Do, and This Shall become clear at the End if we Allow Our Selves To Begin Again), a string the binding (and connecting, umbilically) to the centre, which is what some might call God, or the Beginning which is also the End, which is also the Prime Mover or the Force that sets the Hole Thing into Motion, and the whole is One which starts with O which can also be expressed as Zero.

This One Cycle is (of course, as All Is) a fractal, determined by that most mysterious Fibonacci ratio of Gold that the Alchemists of Old were referring to when they spoke of the conversion of Lead, or past tense of the opposite of Followed - Phi, or 1:1.618.

The wheels, or cycles, or circles, are in circles, or cycles, or wheels, or the One Wheel of their own,

And it all, I suppose, looks like a Clock with infinitely spiralling and overlapping in the third dimension but when viewed from higher up never intersecting Rings, The Many Rings To Rule The All –

A Descent, KATABASIS, to make an ascent, ANABASIS, overall this Hero-In-motioning journey averaging to make a version of an infinitely iterating library of a Horizon in Heaving Stillness of The Breath, or Awareness,

Each subatomic particle or part – I -cull or participle

Each collected curation of prisms of awe-spired organisms in action treads so hopelessly unaware of their Only Sole

Once again, it’s happening

Doubled loss, unravelling

The cover – the covering – the unshrouding rock-pooling in my now-sutured skull

There’s a crack under there

Telling me the Tea, Sis-ter-Ruth-God-to-long-dead-but-still-lightning-Star-thing-where-you-ended

I think so lovingly of my therapist’s slippage into occasional lisp

_and all the tongues laid in restful non-erroneousness through the learning of languages taught and honed but not-so home or shown but sun shone to them as shine of a shoe shows a murky reflection_

As if her pronunciation was an empathetic reflection of my own unravelling of memory of meaning

Learning in words, learning the word for ‘Tree’ by dancing underneath and pointing and saying the first word “Mummy”

Wrapped in bandages now unwrapping in circular waving goodbye to the covering

That’s how the only unknown but felt in unfolding as fabric or light decomposed is set free

                                          Going, oar, Goa, or Ganges’ great gangrenous sore, seeping, sweep-soaring and hands mowing land

                                                                                                                                                          Getting in

I think maybe actually the point of the adventure was as always to teach me by negation that I wasn't supposed to write with academic citation but chaos through chaos the awe of unknowable order unveiling the three years not wasted but waist as in connection between leg and chest up to throat up to bird from a nest down again down again to the egg of the oat sowing rowboat of the raucous of rest

My work is a violence unveiling the gentle harrowed-to-hallowed undeath of letting hours passed of allowing of painting through pain of the ancients’ bloodshed

I had to split*  to become you-

*as in banana, break up, and ending, as in end of hair or life on earth or line of sight lightning, or leave, as in lost from a tree, as in part, as in party, partition, fracked in cyphers of siphoning pipes that are bursting, as in headache, pain unkillable, willing wood’s splitting splinter flinted and flinged into fire warmed with axe for your family, as in branched as an answer, as in cracked, as in spine as in back to the rot of the knots of the would have been better to divide to find shelter much quicker to Wiccan to wicking the sweat or the candle or foresight or blacklit and wits about you spreading your legs at right angles from your hips as in sides from the laughter or after the end which is being bored whole from the start again

So I change

Into the teddy bear pyjamas I’d bought, once, to refer to you –

Bear,

Huntress hanging up her bow

I left these clothes behind not by design but because they were wet through

(I didn’t open the device’s drum in time)

But they have dried now, as roses, _dried roses_,

I am warmed by their dryness, taking off my fishnets and replacing them like a bag of sand with idol of Gold

Only with the lightest smiling thought of you

I remember, replacing the feather once lost with a smaller one on the right hand of my Baphomet statue

How you encouraged me to live so much more carefully and I never even thought to tell you

To live more carelessly

Less,

[opening ritual]

0.            You kneel, right and left feet perched, straddling your altar as if squatting in the forest to empty your vessel which is your body.

1.           You slice the bagel in half, unsure of its moldiness.

2.            You pull the ring from the mackerel can in haste and use the end of a knife to pierce the metal containing the now-passed ocean life within.

3.            You carefully use the same knife to break apart the two fish, releasing them upon the five pointed stars, concentrated in the speckles of the grain.

4.            You lay two sliced gherkins upon each half of the bagel, a library book with a circular spine which is also God, open forever.

5.            You begin to fry an egg and, catching your Self as a fish, take an implement (whichever nearest you can find) and scramble the yolk together with the white.

6.           You lay the scrambled mass of egg, destined for your drum, smiling at its much closer resemblance to an omelette, thinking of the adage that suggests sometimes, a little force is required in order to achieve a goal, how its lesson of number in the breaking wave of the words ‘a few eggs’ seems to be inconsistent with the One egg that you had left to eat, and then you think of your mother and how you could never and probably will never cook as well as she could but at peace with this chimera of culinary insufficiency, you lie the singular egg upon both halves of the bagel, leaving them open.

[X](#_ftnref30) The word “consonant” comes from the Latin root consonare, meaning “to sound together” or “to agree.” This root can be broken down further - “Con-”: a Latin prefix meaning “together” or “with.” - “Sonare”: a Latin verb meaning “to sound.” Originally, consonare referred to sounds that were “sounding together,” signifying harmony or agreement. This idea of sounding together is foundational to both meanings of consonant:

Consonance in Sound (Linguistic): Consonants, in a linguistic sense, “sound together” with vowels to form syllables and words. Unlike vowels, which can be voiced alone, consonants typically need to be paired with a vowel to be fully articulated. In this sense, they are in “agreement” or “harmony” with vowels, creating the building blocks of words.

Consonance in Agreement (Abstract): The concept of things being in agreement or harmonious extends from this “sounding together” notion. Just as consonants need to work with vowels in language, people or ideas that are in “consonance” are in harmony, aligning or “sounding together” metaphorically.

Thus, the Y-branchY connecting these meanings lies in the concept of harmonious sound or agreement, whether literal (in linguistic sounds) or figurative (in aligned ideas). The Latin origin is where the concept diverges into its linguistic use (as a type of letter) and its abstract use (as being in agreement), each stemming from the foundational idea of “sounding together.”

Y Y itself is a branch-letter hybrid that’s neither vowel nor consonant, the first nor the second, but in penultimacy, semi-animacy, half-heard but half-breathed, between two waves which have been separated - X and Z

[OIO](#_ftnref32) Skippers are a group of butterflies placed in the family HesperiidaeH within the order Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies). They were previously placed in a separate superfamily, Hesperioidea; however, the most recent taxonomy places the family in the superfamily Papilionoidea, the butterflies. They are named for their quick, darting flight habits. Much like a finch, sparrow, witch His/Her Eye Is On. Most have their antenna tips modified into narrow unbaited hooks of projections. These bi-winged things mostly have an absence of wing-coupling structure present in Others of their Family.

H _originating from Hesperos_ (evening). _Hesperos_, or _Vesper_ in Latin, is the origin of the name Hesperus -the evening Star (i.e.C the planet Venus) as well as having a shared root with the English word "west".
