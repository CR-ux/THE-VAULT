> *It is, surely, absurd to expect to feel normal, and make sense: I am an amalgamation of fervent cells existing despite all odds; I am the cascading chemical miracle of eating, and surviving; I am not designed to “feel normal”; am not designed, at all; I am experiencing consciousness as provided by wet tangles of electrical pulses; my god, none of this makes sense. It is a blessing, even to feel*

<u>Oar: The Device</u>
<br>

Numanity was now at the endpoint[^end] that its self-same, {in{finitely|separable}|credibly different} components are still {(,) Yet(,)|To Be} unaware of-- the formation of a fully op{era}tional Universe, nested with{in|out} this One. 

At some unknowable Future, now passed[^pass], The Device {Fig. I} of the Wor{l}d is Made Flesh, having sapped the Wor{l}d of its imaginary[^im] resource[^res], the futile, unfulfillable promise to Pay The Bearer (Money); An uncountable team of The Worlds' Scientists and Thinkers were gathered Around, and indeed within, The Device's Epicentre. The First whisperings of this Final Invention have already been laid; and the progression of the experience of Time itself merely an illusion. Time exists, or not, in order[^oe] to package Nowness into a indefinite, yet discrete set of Moments-- with the purpose of affording our Three Dimensional Selves the opportunity to relish, savour and honour the infinite One Moment[^mo]. Thus is the Price of Forgetting.

To Remember, 
One Must First Forget. 

Whirring with a terrifying lightning storm overhead (an unavoidable side-effect of The Device, according to {REDACTED}) The Device was Building a Universe.

> *listen! I am telling you I love you!*
> 
> *I am telling you in a poem that I do not read to you; I am telling you in the shape of the clouds and what we say about them. I am telling you by looking – and, more often, by not looking. I am telling you by leaving the gate open – yes, the one I normally close. I am telling you in my dreams and I am telling you in a text I wrote but forget to send. I am telling you when I dress up to see you, and I am telling you even more when I don’t. I am telling you in the silence of my listening.I am telling you when I take myself less seriously. I am telling you in the centimetres between our knees – aren’t they different, those centimetres? bigger, fuller? I am telling you in small words, loaded up like pack-mules as they cross the 2m endless plain between us. I am telling you in many ways, and I am telling you the many ways in which I love you. I am telling you without telling, when I trust that you feel it too. I am waiting for you to catch up, and I am waiting for a time with words.*

-Adrian
