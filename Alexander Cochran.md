Dear Alexander, 

Given your interest in literary fiction that subverts form to excavate the darker edges of human experience, I believe TWO. FOUR. GIVE. may resonate. It echoes the narrative recursion of Claire Vaye Watkins, the speculative rigor of Naomi Alderman, and the structural daring of Blake Crouch—but veers into far more experimental terrain. This novel isn’t just a story—it’s a recursive device. And I’m not just offering the manuscript. I’m offering the architecture, and the architect. If you’re looking for a writer building the future of narrative form from within the bones of grief, genre, and gender—then I hope you’ll read on.






Dear Alexander,
  
I hope this email finds you well—or at least the right kind of unwell for what follows.
  
I’m submitting the synopsis and opening three chapters of my 99,666-word speculative literary transnovel, TWO. FOUR. GIVE., for your consideration. While this book is formally performative and deliberately unconventional, I believe it resonates with your interest in inventive work reframing the reading experience.
  
This novel has been developed with a performative print and digital structure in mind—forked-path footnote gardens, conceptual poetic mechanisms, and embedded hyperstructure. It’s a story you’re dragged through as much as read {subject|object}. The digital manuscript includes hyperlinked footnotes and a recursive design that mirrors the self-replicating genome at its thematic core. The reader becomes archivist, architect, and replication machinery—like a choose-your-own-adventure with no escape.
  
I’d be honoured to send the full manuscript {and|or} its scripted PDF twin, designed to echo the book’s performance structure.
  
Thank you so much for your time and consideration.
  
Wee bit about me:
  
I’m a conceptual artist and formerly published virologist/bioinformatician (begrudgingly holding an academic citation record). I work across performance, transmedia narrative, and experimental language art. My praxis involves noise music, international performance-as-purge commissions, radio presenting (EHFM), and cryptic online metafiction fragments that challenge reader positioning—as survival ritual.
  
I was the subject and score composer of the award-winning short documentary What It Means to Be, which explored my gender and professional transition (Best Short Doc, KASHISH Pride Film Festival).
  
TWO. FOUR. GIVE. is the monstrous culmination of this lifelong, looping practice—and the work closest to my heart, whether I like it or not: a transnovel as self-replicating, self-reflexive architecture—a parasitic mutaverse.
  
Warmest regards,
Callie Rose Petal
