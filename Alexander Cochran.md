Dear Alexander, 

Given your interest in literary fiction that subverts form to excavate the darker edges of human experience, I believe TWO. FOUR. GIVE. may resonate. It echoes the narrative recursion of Claire Vaye Watkins, the speculative rigor of Naomi Alderman, and the structural daring of Blake Crouch—but veers into far more experimental terrain. This novel isn’t just a story—it’s a recursive device. And I’m not just offering the manuscript. I’m offering the architecture, and the architect. If you’re looking for a writer building the future of narrative form from within the bones of grief, genre, and gender—then I hope you’ll read on.
