At the beginning of our story which is historically not fiction, our character, who for now, which is never, or for better which is worse, we shall simply call "N"[^N], was or is, or will be finalising his scientific paper on Borges' short story _Tlon, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius_.

N lived in a place called TŒMS, filled, and ever-densifying with, a teeming landscape of islands within islands, and an equally ever-densifying landscape of tourism - the economic influx of which provided most of the City's income. TŒMS' population was at a particularly bitter peak[^Peak][^Pe] in its schism[^schism] - splitting the people into two in/out groups[^IO], or two out/in groups see IO: [[Remember]] (2028): those who welcome, almost worship[^ser] change (of the restricted chain[^Ch] of evolution), and those who resist it, clinging to what ancestral truth once was, but tragically, needed to die (the connecting chains[^Ch] of the past).

Title: _Language, Ontology, and the Fabrication of Findings in Tlon, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius_
Abstract: Borges’s _Tlon, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius_ offers a profound exploration of language as both a tool of perception and an instrument of creation, positing a constructed world in which linguistic structures fundamentally shape ontological realities. Within _Tlon_, linguistic and cultural schisms create divergent ontologies, illustrating synecdoche as a principle wherein each part of {REDACTED} populations. Ultimately, Borges’s narrative serves[^ser] as a meditation on the paradox of self and society, revealing how the desire to transcend one’s own constructed reality paradoxically reinforces it, a phenomenon that is as universal as it is particular to ~~TŒMS~~ Tlon. The paper never concludes by suggesting {REDACTED} absolutely Fuck All (FA)[^FA]

N was certainly not the only fan, critic, or even formal scholar, of Borges, in the Citadel. (its name likely being traced back to the titular story about which N's thesis revolved) This eponymous character, or 'quality' (being where the majority of the tourism to the Citadel came from) meant that Borges had become an incredibly divisive figure in this most peculiar and certainly not allegorical place, filled with small bridges (which at their miniscule scale, growing smaller each year, had begun to resemble those of a Crazy Golf course) and shallow, ever-shallowing hexagonal pools of water both connecting, and separating, the dark, jutting ore underfoot - which was not able to be dug into. The terrain once resembled that of the Honeyquartz, organically hive-esque rock pools that N had visited as a child, in a City much further south than this one, but now, with this consuming work seeming to take up memory in his brain as if it were a piece of mechanical circuitry at its memory limit, all he could think about, or dream about, or think about dreaming about, or even dream about thinking about dreaming about[^mis], was a footnote within a footnote on a pseudo-academic post-modern failure to subvert the conceptual narratives of Borges, . 

N's eyelids were heavy, heavy, heavier; signalling the crossing of an immeasurably confusing state of Hypnogogia, which is both opposite to and complementary to its somnolent bookend - Hypopompia. Time always passed, impossibly, like the fleeting, nameless lover who, just that unjust morning, left him alone in his bed, without a word or a deep pitted, dried out Letter of Fare Well-

He was always about to remember something verbatim for the last time in his pseudolife,[^ps] that either his worst friend or his favourite rapist told him in a footnote of a letter

N wanted to shake Borges in the fucking face and say 'you knew didn't you you old new bastard you know! won't you!'

Because he does. 

After he'd learned enough different languages he got closer to learning that there is no language because words aren't not letters but the space between the letters is only one thing.  DNA.

[^R]: The recursive nature of the cycles that we are all in as life forms, all the way down to the subatomic layer, up to the cellular cycle, down to the anatomical cycles of our body, hormonal cycles; the relationship cycles that we go through, the rotational and self-perpetuating trauma that we perpetuate in each other, and obviously the planetary cycles, and then maybe even, the ultimate dreamer



[^Rh]: Linguistics the part of a clause that gives information about the theme. ORIGIN late 19th century: from Greek rhēma ‘that which is said’. Rhymes with Ream [^Re]

[^To]: A subject particularly relevant or pertinent to the moment or theme of events the character in a story which is a fictional account of their lived experience which is non-fictional in its subjectivity of perception which is the only reality any character in any story has as a frame of Reference [^Cite]


[^IO]: Perhaps once a protective form of sociological containment to ensure bonds between constituent members of a stratum, for the purposes of preventing the interaction with an external threat (be it outwithintra-species, (in(out in)without group) or inwithouter-species (out(in, out)within group) in nature) but, through the iterative passage[^P] of a series of self-propagating events perceived subjectively as temporally linear, and the enantiodromic[^E] evolution of both human intelligence and ignorance, continues to cause a disproportionate amount of harm until the real meaning of minerva fighting mars is found through their own vehicle be it an empty chariot with a lion's head door knocker that looks more like a sabre tooth tiger until you look at the same thing a little differently, or a train, or a plane, or a car, or a star, or the wind, or the trees, or through you, or through me, i do not like myself, I am. I do knot like them's am, I am.

[^T]: the manner in which someone behaves towards or deals with someone or something: the Ward enforced equal treatment for men and Women, which is, crucially, not equal to equity; this meant that the so-called "Women's Lounge" reserved for, specifically, Women who had survived abuse-perhaps even at the hands of the very men they shared the psychiatric ward with-were forced to be in the same room as said men, or stay in their bedrooms for the entirety of their treatment,[^T] for their own, self-directed safety. Bedrooms which, of course, had no locks. For their own safety. Informally (i.e. the full treatment) used to indicate that something is done enthusiastically, vigorously, or to an extreme degree: a bit of soft-shoe shuffle[^S] got the full treatment. Medical care given to a patient for an illness or injury: I'm receiving what they call residential treatment for a psychiatric illness that seems to, by the nature of the microcosm of this restrictive modality of not-living reflecting the macrocosm of transphobic society, be making me worse rather than better. A session of beauty or healthcare: electrolysis treatments often form some of the most painful and expensive aspects of an MtF gender transition, in which a needle is inserted into every hair-bearing follicle of the face for either as long as the treatment sessions last or for as long as the patient can bear. The use of a chemical or biological agent to preserve or give particular[^part1] properties to something: the treatment of hazardous waste is particularly[^part] expensive, as I'm sure is bear hunting.

[^Re]: Ream | _noun_, _verb_ | As a _noun_, “ream” signifies a quantity of paper, equating to 500 sheets. Its etymology traces to the Arabic _rizmah_, meaning “bundle” or “package.” i.e. 'the bundle of wallpaper was wet with blood' or 'the recursive narrative was a blood-soaked journey through themes of love, loss, grief, and the Iteratively Inevitable Impossibility of Information's Interpolation with Identity' As a _verb_, “ream” takes on an {opposing|rough|coars}er (therefore, less resistant to change- smooth things are lacking, in their coarseness) usage. It may mean "to {bore {a hole through}|apply intense pressure}". To “ream someone out” refers to delivering a severe {reprimand|scolding}. i.{i.e.}e. 'the author reamed out the reader with reams upon reams of dreamlike sequences of words, varying yet repeatedly reaming the theme of recursion[^N] on a theme[^Th] of {Eventually Existential|Unfortunately Unavoidable} themes on a theme of thematics'[^Them]

[^Swine]: Swine Objection: This critique (by philosophers such as Immanuel Kant and John[^john]] Stuart Mill) of hedonistic utilitarianism (a framework which was a cage conceptualised by Jeremy Bentham) argues that if pleasure alone defines morality, it reduces human pursuits to mere physical gratification, akin to animalistic behaviour, without distinguishing morally 'higher' values. i.e. "we are reducing ourselves to the base behavioural delicacies of swine" For example, consider a woman or person experiencing repeated non-consensual harm by a group deriving pleasure (whether indirectly or not) from her/their suffering. i.{i.e.}e. "you all unknowingly or not fucked my heart without my consent with your neglect and abandonment like my rapist raped my body, you fucking swine"

To sever an artery is more likely to be lethal than the severance of a vein; i.e. "the trans woman pushed to suicide from lack of {spiritual|supportive} framework necessitating her understanding of Death, as not just a physical process but more importantly an egotistical one, attempted to sever her brachial vein in vain" or "the anaesthesiologist who was also the canonical[^Can] Organist of the Glasgow Cathedral injected the general[^Gen] anaesthesia, for the purposes of allowing her to withstand the {incising|peeling} forward of her scalp over her eyes like a shroud of flesh, for the surgeon to debride[^De] the organic inauthenticity encapsulated in the curvature of her cranial vault[^head][^vault] in vein"
[^head]: The cranial vault is a medical term for "Skull". The secretive, singularly subjective experience of being: {"In One's Own Head"|"Off one's head"}, referring to the schismatic[^schism] definitions of "Vault".[^vault] Both of which, are a terrifyingly restrictive ordeal.

I needed the harm you caused me. To outgrow it." In statistics, "taking the mean" means to put everything together, and split it uniformly (see also, but not quite, "Mode"[^mo]);[^T] N.B. "The staff took a mean of the overall needs of the ward's in-patients, leaving those with a more complex set of needs to be treated very meanly.
