 From Cradle 
 to Casket 
 to Castle 
 (*and back!*)
 I loved you!
 You tried to 
 *(as best as i asked!)*
 
 
 In Cradle 
 I met you
 *and Set you in a Tree!*
 in Amber
 of Weighting
 *With Sap, Oh How Gory!
 The Snake Hissed Her Story! 
 Our History! Made Such Spored Glory 
 of All The Whored Out 
 And Undoubting 
 Wee Sprout Of Me!*
 
 
 Then The Casket
 Unasked For, 
 It came,
 Oh! Just As Predicted 
 It Came!
 That Same Shame! 
 That Shame We Became!
 Such Untameable Shame 
 Was the Name of the Game!
 the Blame and the Blazing
 Our Phases of Waning
 and Wailing-Cried, Undried-Out 
 Heinous Old Flame!
 Oh! How it came!
 The Abrading Plane of that Insatiable Grain--
 And again! Such A Pain!
 All Gone! 
 And Remaindered
 Again! And A Gain!
 In Refrain

 -just the Same.
 
 *(He Came!)*
 From The Sun,
 Through The Shadow
 
 My Bonny Buoy 
 Was Jung, 
 and GRowing
 
 
 Now, Castle
 Resting, as Boundary
 as Bricks Red 
 of Regret!
 to Beget 
 to forget.
 *(To fore, Get!)*[^2]
 Two Red! Four Red! 
 Two! Four! Ten! Red!
 Two! Four! Get! 
 You. 
 *(Oh! you!)*
 The One
 I Forget. 
 
 
 Blackened, Reddened, Alighted, 
 on the Edge-
 from Both Sides
 And yet, Oh! 
 The Castle Bricks 
 Stick Right In side!





Yours, No Longer
