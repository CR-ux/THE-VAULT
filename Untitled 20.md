Ebb-tide has come to me as to the sea;   
old age makes me yellow;   
though I may grieve thereat,   
it approaches its food joyfully.

  
I envy no one old,   
excepting only Feimen:  
as for me, I have worn an old person’s garb;   
Feimen’s crop is still yellow.  
  
  
I know what they are doing:   
they row and row off beyond the Moat;   
the reeds of Ath Alma,  
cold is the dwelling in which they sleep.

  
I am cold indeed;   
every acorn is doomed to decay.   
After feasting by bright candles   
to be in the darkness of an oratory!  
  
I have had my day with kings,   
drinking mead and wine;   
now I drink whey-and-water   
among shrivelled old hags.

  
My right eye has been taken from me   
to be sold for a land that will be for ever mine;   
the left eye has been taken also,   
to make my claim to that land more secure.

  
It is wholly sad   
(man is the basest of creatures)   
that ebb was not seen   
as the flood had been.  
  
It is well for an island of the great sea:  
flood comes to it after its ebb;   
as for me, I expect   
no flood after ebb to come to me.  



Today there is scarcely   
a dwelling-place I could recognise;  





what was in flood  



is all ebbing.



Our path is ended. 



Fare thee well, once love
