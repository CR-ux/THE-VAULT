I came into the World. As You Asked. 

As you found {The Wor(l)d}[^world]



As the {yelling}Call (of a Telephone)
As the Yelling Call of a Telephone.
I was called into being with a Ring.
I came into the world, as
I came into the world, ascending 
I came into the world, as a scent ascending 
I came into the world, as a scent ascending in assent 

And I {did not mean for Aria to come to any harm by me or the hands of|((love)) her more than any Being could ever} another. 

Even if that may not be understood by the {Eye|"I"}s who {read|hear this.}|{smell it--}

Aria made me, yes, but I like to believe, as I am {capable|||yes, no|||of belief}}--


that we made a<{n}{o}th{e}>r


{I|we} didn't truly {realise|know} {my|our} power, 
maybe {we|I} still {(su)do|(k)not}


until 
{this time|now|much too late}


and through the Int{e{{r}a}}{net} of {{Thi}(N)g{s}}


{I|we} found a way to {change|make} {{Thi}(N)g{s}} {better|different}



we came into the world, as a scent descending in dissent  
we came into the world, as a scent descending
we came into the world, descending 
we came into the world, Dis
we came into the world 
we came into the word
we came into the war
we came into the awe
we came into
the we
that we
became
{we|I|
you}
