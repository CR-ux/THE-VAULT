These layers of Epigraphs increase in 'embodied physical form', i.e. become more 'real' or 'non-fictional' 




The Woman in the Wallpaper (Hospital Layer)
- Quotes from Adrian, my departed friend.


The Noets (Library Layer)
- Borges quotes, perhaps fictional, perhaps not.

Ædrian/Flo (Bothy Layer)
- Quotes from my favourite children's stories: Bear Hunt, Rascally Cake, Very Hungry Caterpillar, A Series of Unfortunate Events. 


Layer Æ

- Phage 23 {phage 23 was supposed to be a short story (shortest work) which has not been written, most 'fictional' or 'ephemeral/ethereal' epigraphs. }
	- Tree of life/Yggdrasil 
		- Afterlife is actually a Tree, souls cycling through the roots, trunk, leaves- nested trinity. 
		- Once leaves fall, they join the roots once more, this tree is nested within our world -- inversion of canonical heaven being outside of ours. 
		- Protagonist finds, through supernatural hearing afforded by phage 23, that there are voices inside of the central tree of the system of domes that they've had tro build because of the pollution inthe future 
		- These voices are the souls of the Dead, and it's revealed that the afterlife is nested within our life. 
		- This also suggests that the entire system of our undestanding of dreams and altered states for example those experienced by Shamans, are actually on the outside, we ascend to the dreamscape, rather than descend into sleep, we die into the Earth, into the plants, rather than ascend into the heavens. As Below so Above, rather than As Above so Below.

LAYER i|o
- KSHÆ'L {This book was almost written, but descended into RED, RING, PARALLEL (the epigraphs of the next, nested layer.)}
	- Noam and Nima, transgender mirrors, come to terms with a Djinn who has been searching for them both throughout Millennia of history. 



Layer U
- Red, Ring, Parallel {actually *written* but not *released or published*; hundreds of pages, but incredibly difficult to parse by a non-schizophrenic/psychotic mind.}
	- Epistolary/Diary entries of time in psychiatric hospital.

Layer 1
- The Medium is the Wreckage {This is an actual release - an EHFM radio show that has been releasing this whole time, even if now repeat episodes due to my descent into psychosis and inability to keep up with the workload/my mind becoming obsessed with these nested narratives that would eventually become The Children's Gospel Music Songbook.}
	- Quotes from Nonfictional EHFM podcast of mine 


Layer 0 
- Report snippets from Dr Shanahan from time in psych ward. {the 'Realest' of them all - not a story, not any creative medium at all, but rather, the medical explanation of the psychological Destruction/Descent behind what started the whole process of creation/Ascent to some sort of Meaning out of all these painful Memories.}
	- These were the original track titles for 'METABASIS' (now Xlibris) which, in the art-object edition of the book, will be a booksafe containing the Casette tape release, under the Venalism label. These may be condensed into a shorter sequence of epigraphs depending on how many chapters Layer 0 has, but they could be such short chapters that all of them could be used - I like the idea of the chapter structure descending into shorter and shorter vignettes as the narrative pendulum swings further and further from centre (the chess pieces)
