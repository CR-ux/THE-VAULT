A Query

I hope this email finds you well—or at least the right kind of unwell for what follows.

I’m submitting the synopsis and opening ten pages of my 99,666-word speculative literary transnovel, TWO. FOUR. GIVE., for your consideration. Given your taste for fiction that subverts form, engages with the darker edges of humanity, and plays at the threshold of genre—while remaining rooted in the emotionally real—I thought this might resonate.

This novel has been developed with a performative print and digital structure in mind—forked-path footnote gardens, conceptual mechanisms of constructed languages, and visual poetry. It’s a story you’re dragged through as much as read {subject|object}. The digital manuscript includes hyperlinked footnotes and a recursive design that mirrors the self-perpetuating genome at its thematic core. The reader becomes archivist, architect, and replication machinery—like a choose-your-own-demise pseudo-lifeform with no escape.

I’d be honoured to send the full manuscript {and|or} its scripted PDF twin, designed to echo the book’s performance structure.
Thank you so much for your time and consideration.

A wee bit about me

I’m a conceptual artist and formerly published virologist/bioinformatician (begrudgingly holding an academic citation record). I work across performance, transmedia narrative and experimental language art. My praxis involves noise music, international performance-as-purge commissions, radio presenting (EHFM), and cryptic online metafiction fragments that challenge reader positioning—as survival ritual. I was the subject and score composer of the award-winning short documentary What It Means to Be, which explored my gender and professional transition (Best Short Doc, KASISH Pride Film Festival). TWO. FOUR. GIVE. is the monstrous culmination of this lifelong, looping practice—and the work closest to my heart, whether I like it or not: a transnovel as self-replicating, self-reflexive architecture—a parasitic mutaverse.

Sincerely,
Callie Rose Petal
