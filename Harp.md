[^harp]: ![[I_36-37.jpeg]] **Art{i.e.}fact XXXVI-XXXVII:** *"The Holy Lyre Strings Ring Out"* - this section of vellum recovered from the manuscripts of Wiltergarten appears far older than any of the other leaves. The abundance of biological tissue and genomic material still as yet unidentified, has provided one of the most baffling conundrums of the current epoch. Its placement in the middle of the bound signature suggests a nonlinear compilation of the manuscript; which could point to Wiltergarten's work being the progenitor for Endivean technology such as the Fair Well device, later developed in ERA_Ã† by Myo Endive.
