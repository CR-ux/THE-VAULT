1 (god) through the 2 (reversibility) to the 3 (beginning, middle, end). Beginning = 6,  white chess pieces/wane: main forces of the universe (6 mathematical constants required for all existence) group into 4 (the energetic/archetypal alchemical elements), each with their own (nested/coagulated) trinities inside (symbolic(graphemic/pictograph/written - memory(right hand path), somatic(spoken/moved/danced/played- (left hand path)), semantic(meaning/intent/metacognition- (the middle way)). These trinities divide like cells, into Enneads (pantheons of inspirational force/the emanations of god, the muses, sets of 9). These then merge into (separate/but parallel) trinities , 12 of them, representing the zodiac and the respective decans of each)- then through a series of singular and shared branch points, these form the 18 fundamental particles + axion (just before physical manifestation, building blocks ) These 18 paths then group / progress according to the next degree of grouping I.e. those of the 18 that have only one zodiac constituent assigned end there; those with two branch out into dual options, those with 3 into three options, to form 12 total “endpoints” , which are the four elements in trinity (4*3), which represents the material stage, formation of physical life and sensation / humanity / consciousness. These trinities arrange themselves into the three nested cauldrons of poesy; which themselves divide again like cells, or DNA strands, (two factions of the ARIA / DNE schism); forming the opposing chess pieces (black/wax)
