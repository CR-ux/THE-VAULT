**Well (n.)**: A deep source of water, often concealed beneath the earthâ€™s surface; a font of life-sustaining liquid, drawn upon in times of need[^1]; metaphorically, a repository of wisdom, emotion, or creativity[^2^][^3^][^4^] , waiting to be tapped; a convergence of unseen forces, where surface and depth intermingle[^5^][^6^][^7^][^8^][^9^][^10^] , offering nourishment to those who seek its hidden reservoirs that run both at the surface of depth and source of shallowness.
