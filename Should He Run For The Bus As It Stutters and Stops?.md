Yes! He Dooks, In a Flight --
(The Bus Parks In A Puddle)
Left He Looks, Then to Right
*"Bye 'Cus Fuss and Befuddle!"*

And Into That Rolling Box 
Cradled In Wheels 
Where He'd Meet A Fine Fleet 
Of Free-Shuffling Heels!

Asleep [[At The Front]]

Upon The [[Next One]]
Was A Lass Clad In Tan
The [[Back Row]] Seemed Empty 
Upon A Quick Scan 

Do You Know? Can You Choose?
The Crew Whose New Company 
Suits Bindle's Nose-Licking, 
	Row-Picking, 
		Toe-Nipping Plan?
