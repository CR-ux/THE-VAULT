        Performance piece exploring trauma, involving staged self-mutilation with theatrical blood, a prosthetic tongue, live painting, and ending with aggressive extended vocal technique in an open, industrial venue, addressing themes of forced vulnerability and biological essentialism imposed on trans women. Shown in Glasgow and at <em>Homografia Festival</em>, Brussels (2023)."a multidisciplinary performance-as-ritual, evoking the severance of her own tongue and live painting using stage blood with the paintbrush of her naked transfeminine body, expressing what it has meant for her to overcome her own abuse and sexual trauma, severing all which can no longer serve her." </li>

    <h2>Performance & Residencies</h2>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Expanded Universe</h2>
    <p>The <strong>CGMS</strong> project is a durational conceptual performance embedded in a literary corpus — a recursive puzzle wrapped in shame and syntax. It merges the previously unmerged fields of <em>literature</em> and <em>conceptual performance art</em>, inventing a novel artform (literally). The moniker <strong>notBorges</strong> both honors and negates its inspiration, invoking a spectral Borges to haunt every footnote.</p>
    <p>This universe includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Podcast:</strong> An AI-voiced, uncanny broadcast feeding into the CGMS puzzle-ARG framework.</li>
      <li><strong>GitHub Repository:</strong> Home to the <em>Journals of Ariadne</em> — staged as academic work, but laced with embedded storylines in commit messages and pull requests. The development team is fictional: characters from the multiverse itself.</li>
      <li><strong>lexDict:</strong> A Dictionary. A fractalised footnoting system linking to entries that function like metaphysical hyperlinks or fractal doors.</li>
    </ul>
