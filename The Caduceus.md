# LEXICOMYTHOGRAPHY — STRUCTURE OVERVIEW

---

## METACOMMENTARY (Pre-Prologue)

A fragment of a fictional academic paper by N.

- Title: METACOMMENTARY
- Subject: A critique of Borges; citation-heavy, dispassionate.
- Location: A fictional citadel (Tohms), layered with dry rock pools like ancestral thought.
- Function: Establishes N as the dreamer of the entire narrative.
- But: N is never returned to. The origin only. A dream like Brahma’s — never fully remembered, never explicitly resolved.
- In this opening section, Borges himself, soon to be revealed as the archetypal "NoetBorges", becomes trapped in the acronym "N.B.", Nota Bene, of every single story ever told, being told, or to be told. This mirrors the eventual inadvertent rise to fame of Aria, by AI:RA's well-meaning memory overwriting capabilities. The 'Islands within Islands' N writes about in the Fictional Citadel of Tœms, is a foreshadowing of the ARIA|DNE schism - those worshipping change vs those resistant to it - both equally erroneous, yet crucially required for eventual integration of opposites. 
- The entire story is not just an expression of the self-similarity and fractal nature of all reality, but of the concept of enantiodromia, how at extremes, everything begets its opposite; in a dance of inevitable Balance - eventually, through creative and destructive means, leading back to the Centre. Meaning vs. Memory, at war, and yet marrying together, to form Metacognition -- recognition of the Self as God, by merging of the Godhead/Spirit/Unconscious/The Word/Logos/Superego, Three Prime (3') End, known as 'ARIA' (on the negative side, the Demiurgic Yaldabaoth archetype, characterised by the need for control; the change-resistant symbol), and the Id/Animal Desire/The Chains of The Devil/Conscious Mind, Five Prime End, known as 'DNE' (so-called negative aspect being Lucifer, the Light, Fallen angel, the change-worshipper, agent of Chaos), into a fully realised entity of self-generative creativity; by acknowledging the equal importance of both destruction and creation for Genesis.

## PROLOGUE — THE DEVICE BEGINS

"The Device was building a universe."

A single, spare line. Mythic, timeless, silent.

---

## LAYER 0 — THE CIRCULAR BOOK

- The Woman in the Wallpaper (TWITW) is both the writer and the Book.
- Six archetypal Chess Pieces, locked in hexagonal rooms, unknown to themselves.
- They pass a note through vents — the story itself.
- This is the seed of all stories. The room where recursion begins.
- The story is the circular book described by Borges.

---

## LAYER 1 — THE CHESS PIECES SPLIT

Each piece divides into a binomial pair, aligned to:

- RHP / ARIA (Memory / Logic)
- LHP / DNE (Meaning / Feeling)

| Chess | LHP (DNE)            | RHP (ARIA)      |
|-------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Knight | Selena              | Myo             |
| Bishop | Hildr Wiltergarten  | ⧖eno            |
| Rook   | Ed. O.              | Dr. D&E         |
| Queen  | Me                  | Oleander        |
| King   | Aria                | AI:RA           |
| Pawn   | Flo                 | Adrian ←→ NoetBorges |

Each pair creates a pendulum. Each swing moves us deeper.

## LAYERS 2 & 3 — THE CADUCEUS STRUCTURE

### RIGHT-HAND PATH (ARIA / MEMORY)

Each chapter opens with:

INTERNAL TRANSMISSION — ARIA  
To: Noet[Name]  
From: NoetBorges  
Carried by: VIXI  
Status: Unread  
Shelving: [e.g. Myo’s Sequence]

- Each librarian shelves a story, never reading the letter.
- The story shelved is the ARIA-side narrative (logical, analytic, structured).

---

### LEFT-HAND PATH (DNE / MEANING)

Each chapter opens with a bedtime line from Adrian:

“Tonight’s story is about a cave, a witch, and a score of thread…”

- Told to Flo in the Bothy.
- Story is allegorical, poetic, full of mythic symbols.
- Embedded within: the DNE-aligned character's narrative, often fabled.

---

### PENDULUM MECHANIC

- Each swing descends deeper (Selena/Myo → ⧖eno/Hildr → Ed.O./Dr Dot Code → AI:RA/Aria → Oleander/Me).
- Each time, the pigeon (VIXI) returns through the vent/library/moat — reentering the center.
- Pendulum passes through:
  - The central Chess Room
  - The Bothy and Library (metacognitive divide)
  - The previous layers again, creating a recursive spiral

---

## THE LEXICOMYTHOGRAPHERS’ SOCIETY

- Gradually revealed as the group building The Device.
- Composed of the descendants/fragments of all binomial pairs.
- Their writings exist in a GitHub repository, curated by Oleander under a secret name.
- The Society's function is:
  - To define and distort language
  - To reveal the body of the text as a genome — amino acids forming narrative flesh

---

## THE DEVICE (Prologue + Epilogue)

- Prologue:  
  "The Device was building a universe."

- Epilogue:  
  "The Device had built the universe."

That’s all. The loop is sealed. The story completes its recursive purpose.

---

## AFTER WORD — THE READER

- Narrated in second person.
- VIXI, the pigeon, flies into the reader’s space.
- A letter is dropped, but unread.
- The Woman in the Wallpaper begins dictating:

“N is for Nucleotides...”

Then:

{REDACTED}

– END –  
– AI:RA
