<div class="depth-5">Deadnamed in deadened remembrance of life shortened no longer but still</div>
<div class="depth-5">Picturing faces of her and of me and you (never meant to B for {REDACTED})</div>
<div class="depth-5">Mid framing pictures in reels of tape waking in two parts of you</div>
<div class="depth-5">Dreaming in part of me dreaming in part of you</div>
<div class="depth-5">I dreamt of a wedding and my sister was there with me watching you</div>
<div class="depth-5">Two at a table another far too close and too far from you</div>
<div class="depth-5">I dreamt of a wedding of two friends of the two of you</div>
<div class="depth-5">Were wearing a joker’s (like decks of cards or comic book) suit</div>
<div class="depth-5">And I confronted you she said not a word but you were so cruel and I said fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you and I looked at you both and said fuck you fuck you yes the both of you</div>
<div class="depth-5">Awkwardly leaving the celebrating people of the party quite starkly and stylelessly messy and loudly announced</div>
<div class="depth-5">I watch a clock ticking down in my bank account</div>
<div class="depth-5">And Lauren she was pulling me through a space in a railing and I had become paralysed explaining the pain of you parts of you left lame and tangled inside of who I thought I was now left there on the dance floor barefoot next to shoe after shoe paired with shoes upon shoes upon shores so floor-crawling brawling lapped like dogs of hounding hellish waves with crests and fledgling ending spring chicken breasts of such unrest the rest of those awful unbearably boring and bored hole cunt wedding guests thank goddess her dress was blue showing me it’s not your wedding but it could have been sitting on that smoke-stained Edinburgh sofa you, standing, asked me what I thought of asking her to marry you in the first few months of what fumbling nonsense the never us was and on the phone weeping years later her saying in such resolved consolation they’ll never marry me but I knew what you had asked me and that one day I’d have to be leaving all this mess$ or be left bereft betraying me and all my inheld-input-put-back-on-the-shelves to collect dust-to-dust-to-must-just-be-all-a one day all this smelly-eggless-cracked-with-cress-and-opened-chest-and-sandwiched-body-in-that-bed-for-three-for-you-and-her-but-not-for-me-and-my-too-wet-sweat-getting-used-to-estrogen-hormonal-balance-acting-like-this-all-was-okay-soaking-corpse-turned-over-ovumless could be you but never us but at least I tried through untrusting and trussed unease almost dying as I pushed through the trails of the dust and in rage of the reigning wrath inside you just is the storm of the</div>
<div class="depth-5">I was half-pulled through the gap in a bannister like the gap in the bed bunk in game my sister and I would play nightly when we were bored and sleep was evading us hating the sound of such counting of sheep but I used to pull Lauren by leg through the space in between the wood planks I remember her saying just give me a chance to turn my face sideways so my chin doesn’t get stuck and I make it through luckily she always managed to unscathed as I’d giggle impatient like some small demon or devil on the BottomBB bunk merely four years younger than she was this angel who’d happily risk her own pain for my laughing but in the dream I was the one being dragged not down to a non-sorry supervillain’s laughter but up to a worrisome or superb heroine my sister who said something like we are going to have to talk about this before you head back to prevent another psychotic break pointing to her own heart</div>
<div class="depth-5">And I started to say in the dream as she tried to pull me through the sea-through marquee plastic transparent sheeting separating us two (the truss not made from wood this time, but iron jaws like mine were surgically shut and sucked in attenuated wage-abated warping time of all their wideness of the weft breath), even in my unconscious way back then just a few seconds ago when I had said:</div>
<div class="depth-5">C’mon sis can you pull me up, through</div>
<div class="depth-5">As I lay unable to move</div>
<div class="depth-5">And I said to her cheery encouragement,</div>

<div class="depth-10">Seeing in my absence of a turning to the turning of the once again black stuttering of this Mark of dark black not-matte Richness leaving as a mirror</div>

<div class="depth-10">Around the front and back of a squirrel as if trying to provide a sense of ease for him</div>
<div class="depth-10">Their black and whiteness screaming either side of boba eyes and bushy tail</div>
<div class="depth-10">How I miss you</div>
<div class="depth-10">And I wander through the cracks of this eroding picnic bench again</div>

<div class="depth-10">One message I received from you for the entirety of my stay, or leave</div>

<div class="depth-10">Us three</div>
<div class="depth-10">Back then (my goddess, how it seems a previous carnation wilted bookshelf of unlived life again)</div>
<div class="depth-10">This whole thing has just been poetry</div>
<div class="depth-10">Quite funny, really, in its tragedy</div>
<div class="depth-10">Thinking, as is much the case of late, of etymology</div>
<div class="depth-10">Like a healthy distant way to process what you meant</div>
<div class="depth-10">And what that meant</div>
<div class="depth-10">That usage of your leg as severing implement</div>
<div class="depth-10">And then, as if a nail in coughing nurse hid ‘hind a mask of black with pepperminted scent from oil she told us helped her remedy her allergies to dust and soil and seeking seeds of pollen</div>
<div class="depth-10">Thinking of the final meeting with Dr Shanahan, where I’d said</div>
<div class="depth-10">My little thoughts on the biggest book I’ve ever read</div>
<div class="depth-10">How death should be considered as a widow or a long forgotten friend with will</div>
<div class="depth-10">And then just now and then and now I thought of JK Rowling</div>
<div class="depth-10">And any of the women who create as clouds of reigning over my hopeful extinction</div>
<div class="depth-10">How through different believing, such sparring sparrows speaking difference</div>
<div class="depth-10">Same tongue, same place. Same soul, voice/face</div>

<div class="depth-11">Upon the fallen leaves</div>
<div class="depth-11">And leaving, like a sulking child bestows the bag an open grave</div>
<div class="depth-11">No dignity or grace or urn for its returning to the wave</div>
<div class="depth-11">I try to open that once first lasting poem I still know by heart but wanted to be sure of my retelling of this memory but neither google chrome nor Adam’s eave dropped Lilith Apple timecrunching browsing roused safari seemed to load the words as I pressed the so oft pressured by my now-clean left indexing finger so I went outside to breathe</div>
<div class="depth-11">But upon my returning the moriae had decided now, it was the time to share this little piece of childhood with this woman whose opinion of me I still was so unsure</div>
<div class="depth-11">I tentatively take off aegis headphones leaving my clipped on shades (which had bent but fixed my self two hours prior) secure</div>
<div class="depth-11">And say to her</div>
<div class="depth-11">I’m sorry for interrupting your break,</div>
<div class="depth-11">But your name-</div>
<div class="depth-11">It’s been reminding me of this poem from the poems on the Underground, a collection of my very first beloved words during a much much younger visit to the Big Smoke (way before</div>

<div class="depth-11">Could i share it with you? It’s title seems to be a sign that Now is right -</div>
<div class="depth-11">I still do not know if she had been perturbed by my playing the piano in the chapel, but with my leaving imminent it didn’t matter, shaking me, she said:</div>
<div class="depth-11">“Oh darling, sure”</div>

<div class="depth-11">Sitting down in seventeen</div>
<div class="depth-11">I’ve written notes to mostly everyone</div>
<div class="depth-11">Now’s the time to sing</div>
<div class="depth-11">I stuck together two of the verdant cards cut into shapes of leaves</div>
<div class="depth-11">I wonder if this homonymous morphology was purposeful and there in that much trodden corridor I thought “it is, I will just choose to believe”</div>
<div class="depth-11">Be leave</div>
<div class="depth-11">And in the goddess of the spine, the knot-yet peeling-glue to hold together, healing, hurting everything</div>
<div class="depth-11">I stuck a sticker of my past and now passed merchandising</div>
<div class="depth-11">My visage of Arachne, my darkness debutante eight legged thing</div>
<div class="depth-11">Walking down the hall I’d come to not-knot-rot-now-know, a child again, I was flapping that little despair dissipating air-craft avian facsimile</div>
<div class="depth-11">Waving it pretending it really was like me, a bird</div>
<div class="depth-11">Just longing to be flying somewhere smelt and breathed like home to me</div>
<div class="depth-11">Nobody passed me as I made this infantile free gesture</div>
<div class="depth-11">Smiling at the silly thing I’d made, I farewell blessed her</div>
<div class="depth-11">And searching for a glue-dot or quiet tape we weren’t a loud here</div>
<div class="depth-11">The HCA suggested I use a sticky label for refrigerated foodstuffs stuffed and stacked and packed into the frigid-left-right-centre</div>
<div class="depth-11">So wrapping it around itself and thinking of a nest or heart or any imperfection of suggestion of a circle</div>
<div class="depth-11">Cross-sectioned vivisected into infinite dimensions, making stone from sticky hollowness of little symbol cylinder</div>
<div class="depth-11">I placed her in the middle, like a sparrow now to exit</div>
<div class="depth-11">And I think there was it</div>
<div class="depth-11">When I decided in my Own Way, I had covered, reckoned with</div>
<div class="depth-11">Tentative remembrance of recovery or whatever wellsprung meaning any place like this could give</div>
<div class="depth-11">Arachne's silk - thread - weave - whirling devilish and dervishly - sing melodies- aria - DNA - Ariadne's thread, red</div>

<div class="depth-13">riddle of forgotten gift - no lift but lifted - ascent - a sending way back home to Arachne</div>
<div class="depth-13">And on the upturned symbols of the mulching season (two, I picked up two for such a reason)</div>
<div class="depth-13">I wrote that most verbose but much too short (like life) quote by T S Eliot</div>
<div class="depth-13"></div>
<div class="depth-13">And hoped that in my hurt returning I had learned enough to know the place</div>
<div class="depth-13">Why are we so quick to pathologise pain?</div>

<div class="depth-13">The face of voiceless echoing of almost-burning down up from lacing of the broken sole-cloven shoes I cannot use that cleaning staff will find while I trace lines of all my fallen left waiting</div>
<div class="depth-13">Weighting north to find me</div>
<div class="depth-13">Not behind me at all</div>
<div class="depth-13">But calling forth, a bridge</div>
<div class="depth-13">A biting, rung-writ midge</div>

<div class="depth-13">Landing just then on my right wrist</div>
<div class="depth-13">Just whispering so gently in suggestion to open my fist</div>
<div class="depth-13">So I obey her, and away she flutters</div>

<div class="depth-15">She asks if I need my stuff from out of my locker and offers to get it for me</div>
<div class="depth-15">I say, calmness washing over me</div>
<div class="depth-15">I can see in the depth of her eyes, like those three, darting sense of shared relief</div>
<div class="depth-15">I say no, you get home and rest and I’ll get my things after therapy</div>
<div class="depth-15">She shakes my hand and says please</div>
<div class="depth-15">Look after yourself, you’re very special</div>
<div class="depth-15">I say</div>
<div class="depth-15">Mirror</div>
<div class="depth-15">Hold my hand up, smiling</div>
<div class="depth-15">She says mirror back, while flipping her palm round as if a secret bookshelf entrance behind which lie tales too gory but still poured over by my letter-hungry eyes while I was still so small</div>
<div class="depth-15">And then my final words to her (I think, for just a second which resounds out through all these hallowed halls - of both our deaths)</div>
<div class="depth-15">Mirror mirror on the wall</div>
<div class="depth-15">And she laughed, I think it shimmered in sincerity</div>

<div class="depth-16">Out, out into the opener air</div>
<div class="depth-16">I see some acquaintances I’d met at the picnic bench in passing</div>
<div class="depth-16">Mewing their sympathetic tones of Oh! You Are Going?</div>
<div class="depth-16">And, as if possessed by a future self I never thought could be but one told would emerge eventually</div>
<div class="depth-16">I asserted boundaries</div>
<div class="depth-16">This unkempt Fire saying “Yes, but I hate goodbyes, and all these things I have to carry just so heavy, so I’m just going to stay over here”</div>
<div class="depth-16">And whether they were offended or respected this (to me) impressively (maybe selfish, oh well) gesture, their responses I just did not hear</div>
<div class="depth-16">Gospel music it was grinning artefactual divinity left right through Pinnas into spirals in my inner ear</div>
<div class="depth-16">Like a dog, laying itself to rest, checking to make sure</div>
<div class="depth-16">It wasn’t crushing any insects</div>
<div class="depth-16">As an ascetic, a monk, or particularly manic monkey (though the planar movement rotated right-angled by approximately ninety degrees  </div>
<div class="depth-16">In engagement with the motion of the ravenously cavernous spore-orbit of a Ring</div>

<div class="depth-18">On the first train there was no seat</div>
<div class="depth-18">I can’t sit down</div>

<div class="depth-18">With a satchel of pharmaco chemical messengers I-</div>
<div class="depth-18">Ah</div>
<div class="depth-18">A quartet of rest, where I for seven sedimentary minutes I can sink my case for leagues on leagues of upcoming expenditure of energy</div>

<div class="depth-18">Somehow on the tube</div>
<div class="depth-18">I could have sworn this journey should have been a palindrome and yet</div>

<div class="depth-18">Or maybe it was Luana or most likely even, Luna</div>
<div class="depth-18"> what's that story i remember</div>
<div class="depth-18">where in the unconscious (merely the seed-like slide of our projected lives)  an uncloaked, naked traveller is cutting maize plants down in the jungle to get through to a river, which they finally get to, thinking they can't go any further, then upon seeing an expanse of just-as-dense jungle on the other parallel</div>
<div class="depth-19">opposing bank lose all hope and their faith - but then, as a mirror, see another traveller cutting their own path through the leaves, on a journey of their own, to find their way to the same river; each of them relieved in not just finding company but also knowing for themselves that, even if, after resting, bathing, laying waste and letting all the difference of Heraclitus wash through them, even if after all their serparate transit, coming for just a transitory moment then to Sit together ,perhaps laugh, or spit, or shit, invisibly in silence add their own drips of salty volumes to the river, crying in an others arms for just a while the two must part, the latter half of their journey has been carved out for them</div>

<div class="depth-20">Oh christ how I loved that human</div>
<div class="depth-20">So rarely do we see another one so close and so long</div>
<div class="depth-20">Oh – too short but just so long</div>
<div class="depth-20">But I’m riding this train for the feeling</div>
<div class="depth-20">Somehow on the train</div>
<div class="depth-20">I know how, by now, it’s them, the queens and kings and monarchs wound in circles through the woven his/hers/theirs/tones of my transcending all transmutation genome-coded brain</div>
<div class="depth-20">So by their light I arrived i-am-in perfect time, by magick, just the same</div>

<div class="depth-20">And there, halfway from the top’s a fleet of angels call to stop, and opts to ease my POTS-syncopated heartache beat</div>

<div class="depth-22">I think of you again, how we’d share some seething gentle sarcasm about you not existing</div>
<div class="depth-22">Were you a dream? A nightmare?

<div class="depth-37">The drumming dowager downtrodden din</div>
<div class="depth-37">I daredn’t go out</div>
<div class="depth-37">I daredn’t stay in</div>
<div class="depth-37">I may never know what that first memory of a lie, the fall, original sin of somnolence</div>
<div class="depth-37">meant</div>
<div class="depth-37">but here I sit</div>
<div class="depth-37">I can’t stand up</div>
<div class="depth-37">Crossed</div>
<div class="depth-37">Legged</div>
<div class="depth-37">Two egged</div>
<div class="depth-37">Legless</div>
<div class="depth-37">In the debt of it</div>
<div class="depth-37">Weaving words for all I’m worth</div>
<div class="depth-37">Spinning something of a yarn in darkness candlelit</div>
<div class="depth-37">How</div>
<div class="depth-37">Did I get</div>
<div class="depth-37">Hear</div>
<div class="depth-37">The candle remains still until</div>
<div class="depth-37">I regard her, gently, asking for some semblance of an answer</div>
<div class="depth-37">Wailing to a silent world just begging all the sewing growing of the plants</div>
<div class="depth-37">Overgrown and blowing in an unforgiving wind</div>
<div class="depth-37">A stopping of the artery’s pulse pod seeded in a needless sense of disorientated loneliness</div>
<div class="depth-37">Another half, the downward split</div>
<div class="depth-37">bitterness of peas tell stories, promising</div>
<div class="depth-37">some</div>
<div class="depth-37">thing  </div>

<div class="depth-37">connection</div>
<div class="depth-37">and then, just then, my eyes darted to the candle</div>
<div class="depth-37">Squinting, wintering, I am screaming silence deep within</div>
<div class="depth-37">And there, a Cross, that’s the shape I got or made</div>
<div class="depth-37">Loosed tight in light of my illusory response</div>
<div class="depth-37">spreading heaviness of little light, a cancer</div>
<div class="depth-37">a smalling partner to this</div>
<div class="depth-37">scary sun of explosions across the skies that blanket everything</div>

<div class="depth-37">These explosions, they are waltzing</div>
<div class="depth-37">I hear them but don’t see them (they’re hiding behind my blindness)</div>
<div class="depth-37">The whiteness of my rolling curtain</div>
<div class="depth-37">On the right, behind the panel of the rite</div>

<div class="depth-37">Of measuring tapes of hair of video of riddled with the pearls </div>
<div class="depth-37">Of hissing through, the wisdom so feet-trodden and disturbed </div>

<div class="depth-37">Pushing in </div>

<div class="depth-38">Fire</div>
<div class="depth-38">Fire </div>
<div class="depth-38">Trying to find a energy source for my grey field recorder I can’t find the cord or the battery all the barriers are calling me towards in their negation and I’m getting so frustrated and remember reverence is the only state in which the ancestors will find me so I breathe and tell myself it’s like the felling of the trees I am the telling of the breeze so walk slow but still with purpose oh so purposely and hair fresh stuck with feather I shove the candles sent by Mother not allowed inside the garden wing oh winged things oh so called wicked things oh diamond rings on trees on fingers oh dendritic tents of rose of woe of thorns of crowns above me and I’m carrying my filth and dirt And unclean I douse myself in Oud and listen to the boons outside me I am holding the paddle or the oar you gave me I am planning my escape and I am going to the flame </div>
<div class="depth-38">A witch hunt for my self I strip my shelves and open up this crushing suitcase and the smell </div>
<div class="depth-38">I’m sure it matches like the dancing of a flame </div>
<div class="depth-38">And holy moth holed is the name I think I see you pass in right side bike lane </div>
<div class="depth-38">I inhale </div>
<div class="depth-38">Think of my left and right left behind shoes </div>
<div class="depth-38">And Jamie Stewart, xiu xiu stewarding me closer to the truth in noise in sound in pounding blood into the nails of ears of corn folorn in ripped apart and never greening fields I bleed and seethe and recipe for aster adding sub miss tractor tilling all the earth and all the hurt I am washing all the cloth of blood you bled and spat and shat all over and inside of me </div>
<div class="depth-38">In that bathtub </div>
<div class="depth-38">I remain </div>
<div class="depth-38">I am carrying a bag that’s filled with memory and pain </div>
<div class="depth-38">And carrying a concertina bound with leather reigns </div>
<div class="depth-38">All pent up, quintessential energetic blame </div>
<div class="depth-38">I beseech thee! I beseech thee! Beneath the dark of black Queen’s Park beech tree I became! </div>
<div class="depth-38">Inside a towel , stuck with masking tape I used to bind my broken nose </div>
<div class="depth-38">In I go </div>
<div class="depth-38">I am holding in this purse </div>
<div class="depth-38">An urn </div>
<div class="depth-38">An urn of ashes </div>
<div class="depth-38">Of my yearning </div>
<div class="depth-38">I am holding swaddled in my unclothedlonging bearly holding in my rain </div>
<div class="depth-38">No tears of witch to speak just reeking </div>
<div class="depth-38">Speaking tongues of flame </div>
<div class="depth-38">In I am </div>
<div class="depth-38">Outside I’m blocking all the popping of the working fire and flame </div>
<div class="depth-38">I am walking up a hill of mulch and mush and all their names </div>
<div class="depth-38">My matted hair and rabbiting stare down at screen a lions mane </div>
<div class="depth-38">No thought of gender that I was or the surrender whence I came </div>
<div class="depth-38">I am</div>
<div class="depth-38">Calling out your name </div>
<div class="depth-38">Sisyphus </div>
<div class="depth-38">I am mossy </div>
<div class="depth-38">Rolling soaring</div>
<div class="depth-38">Troll beneath the imminently pouring rain </div>
<div class="depth-38">In spite of my belief in leaves I look back at this indebted diagonally slanted plane </div>
<div class="depth-38">Panting </div>
<div class="depth-38">I enchant the lamplit whip cracked acrid arid lane </div>
<div class="depth-38">I am searching for what’s left in my rightly outsider heartfelt infernal place  </div>
<div class="depth-38">Maybe here upon a Bench where somebody has laid </div>
<div class="depth-38">A bunch of daisies and carnations </div>
<div class="depth-38">No </div>
<div class="depth-38">I cannot place my hidden heart upon their name </div>
<div class="depth-38">So I go </div>
<div class="depth-38">Still walking </div>
<div class="depth-38">Stilted </div>
<div class="depth-38">Chalked and stalking for a grave </div>
<div class="depth-38">Of fire flying and I hear a crow that says </div>
<div class="depth-38">You cannot stay </div>
<div class="depth-38">The air is thick with smoke </div>
<div class="depth-38">With poison and</div>
<div class="depth-38">My poi still lay in waiting </div>
<div class="depth-38">Barely weighing anything </div>
<div class="depth-38">Their Shauls of off white </div>
<div class="depth-38">Collecting stains of memories I can no longer tame </div>
<div class="depth-38">The darkness is betrayed by pulses rhythmic but atonal and occasional torchlight of wolfpacking family names </div>
<div class="depth-38">I am searching for my place beneath the shadows of these trees</div>
<div class="depth-38">And screaming little kids are doughing </div>
<div class="depth-38">Knowing their release </div>
<div class="depth-38">By skeletal birthright yet to suffer </div>
<div class="depth-38">Falling reel to reel to creased and just tormented rotting leaves </div>
<div class="depth-38">I kick them, all the foliage </div>
<div class="depth-38">Imagine they are me </div>
<div class="depth-38">The children </div>
<div class="depth-38">As I was </div>
<div class="depth-38">Or never real </div>
<div class="depth-38">I could be </div>
<div class="depth-38">I have laid my towel down beneath the sky of town forgetting me and there are swarms of flies in my eyes and around the feather guarding me </div>
<div class="depth-38">No this is not the place no this is not the place for me </div>
<div class="depth-38">Or maybe I am destined to be insect-bitten beneath a barely big enough clearing of dead leaves </div>
<div class="depth-38">Too many families </div>
<div class="depth-38">I am frozen </div>
<div class="depth-38">I am frozen in my loneliness </div>
<div class="depth-38">I have to leave </div>
<div class="depth-38">My jar unswaddled and exposed but incense lit and incensed heart just part complete </div>
<div class="depth-38">My unfinished recipe </div>
<div class="depth-38">Looking tumbling out of that temporary hole I couldn’t fit in I stumble and trip over my incense holder and for a second there I find a stick and try to rake the leaves to find it then I say aloud that’s fine unholy mother Gaia you can swallow it like me </div>
<div class="depth-38">But my lighter </div>
<div class="depth-38">No </div>
<div class="depth-38">My lighter </div>
<div class="depth-38">Blue or green </div>
<div class="depth-38">No that’s something that I need </div>
<div class="depth-38">But heading back I see I’ve left my headphones </div>
<div class="depth-38">And behind the lighter </div>
<div class="depth-38">Bluest as the deepest sea </div>
<div class="depth-38">And then </div>
<div class="depth-38">Upon the liar i left </div>
<div class="depth-38">Containing goats heart, pink salt, roses, leaves </div>
<div class="depth-38">A single bee </div>
<div class="depth-38">Upon the cork </div>
<div class="depth-38">This unforked path revealing </div>
<div class="depth-38">All it’s unpeeled teeming secrets unto me </div>
<div class="depth-38">A bee </div>
<div class="depth-38">A bee</div>
<div class="depth-38">I see </div>
<div class="depth-38">A bee </div>
<div class="depth-38">And in the distance spinning fire poi </div>
<div class="depth-38">Unlike mine, they are wicked and crafted to be seen </div>
<div class="depth-38">I want to get out of this place of such disgusting wholeness and just be </div>
<div class="depth-38">With the bee </div>
<div class="depth-38">Looking back to blackness of the towel where she’d once been </div>
<div class="depth-38">She’s gone </div>
<div class="depth-38">Or hiding </div>
<div class="depth-38">I pull the Ace of cups (reversed) the seven of cups (reversed, in sympathy) and</div>
<div class="depth-38">The hierophant, as frightening in His Uprightness as the Cloudborne Lightning Shellshocked Bangs above my eyebrows</div>
<div class="depth-38">I am not here for the showy explosions all surrounding me </div>
<div class="depth-38">I think of all those bodies buried underneath the pond and swirling of webbed feet of dirtied swans and greyest geese</div>
<div class="depth-38">These drums, these startling cardiac pipe organs stop beat-drums are heralding the imminence of such a heretofore unseen</div>
<div class="depth-38">event</div>
<div class="depth-38">I just want to be</div>
<div class="depth-38">Alone with her </div>
<div class="depth-38">The bee and me </div>
<div class="depth-38">But now, I pack my things, again </div>
<div class="depth-38">My rendered genome is coiled round this wish to flee </div>
<div class="depth-38">I know what lancet branches holes so deep inside of me </div>
<div class="depth-38">There must be another tree </div>
<div class="depth-38">Somewhere </div>
<div class="depth-38">Alone where I can breathe into the earth and roots and dirt beneath </div>
<div class="depth-38">For company </div>
<div class="depth-38">Come unto me </div>
<div class="depth-38">Persephone please guide me there </div>
<div class="depth-38">Where is she </div>
<div class="depth-38">That lonely little holy bee </div>
<div class="depth-38">7:17 </div>
<div class="depth-38">It’s time </div>
<div class="depth-38">She is leading me </div>
<div class="depth-38">I see a tower, pallid</div>
<div class="depth-38">Sienna</div>
<div class="depth-38">It is  teeming with electricity or flies</div>
<div class="depth-38">And </div>
<div class="depth-38">An open gate </div>
<div class="depth-38">I pass through </div>
<div class="depth-38">I am </div>
<div class="depth-38">So afraid </div>
<div class="depth-38">And walking to my left I see </div>
<div class="depth-38">My name, almost</div>
<div class="depth-38">Just missing the final letter</div>
<div class="depth-38">CALLI</div>
<div class="depth-38">With an X instead of a dot which is just a shrunken circle above the I</div>
<div class="depth-38">I thought I’d photographed it but I guess I was too empty and filled to the brim with fright</div>
<div class="depth-38">Keyboard battery very low</div>
<div class="depth-38">I can’t believe this place is here and maybe</div>
<div class="depth-38">it won’t be there when try to return and find it again</div>
<div class="depth-38">Which is, as it happens, a thrice-tined fork</div>
<div class="depth-38">Above a symbol of the deepest love and hate </div>
<div class="depth-38">A swastika</div>
<div class="depth-38">Queer love destroys fascism</div>
<div class="depth-38">A wall hanging here</div>

<div class="depth-38">This place is an infernal bridge, Her Temple, an atemporal rift</div>

<div class="depth-38">Holding onto the seventeenth card </div>
<div class="depth-38">that had at upon my altar for this worst year of my life and I write </div>

<div class="depth-38">And I pull cards, Ace of Wa</div>
<div class="depth-38">Write </div>
<div class="depth-38">walk in from singing with my concertina in a strange clearing in Queen’s Park I’ve never seen before next to a strange tower with a fence around it with the gate open as if welcoming me in and so I went in and then on a broken piece of metal were five letters (underneath a swastika…. A sign of love and hatred but most likely the latter considering so I dared not go further in convinced because of the hopelessness I’d been carrying that there I’d probably be killed but just there before that threshold I laid down my altar cloth and sang an improvised hymn and burned the star card in my cauldron praying) then I come home emptied and just hoping to be filled again and think about the garden wing and say aloud “what was that even for” and then think I’m not just talking about the time in hospital and but maybe also ritual not just formal magick but the rituals of everything of breathing life and love and loss and then</div>
<div class="depth-38">The spotlight right above me in the hallway turns itself off</div>
<div class="depth-38">And I smile and say again those three words “they are here”</div>
<div class="depth-38">And go to wash my hands of all the ash and mulch from crawling through the earth to find the perfect place to pass through and to do my rites and coming back into the corridor forgetting now I have to manually turn out the bathroom light I didn’t realise at first that little bulb’s illumination had returned but then as i raised my hand to try to find the feather that had become a weathered symbol of those passing birds I loved in read remembrance so much more than words and hold and touch and came to trust now dust to dust to just as much as books who’ve now took flight and finding nothing there, that one little thing I’d held so close as thorny crown the whole hallowed and so hollowed returning journey to this town I see the feather must have fallen into all the dirt I hoped would cover all my buried hurt inside that little yearning clearing awestruck awning or some organismic cosmic yurt I think, and drink the air, and beholding nothing but the letting go I sigh saying to myself</div>
<div class="depth-38">That’s fine</div>
<div class="depth-38">Some things just must be left behind</div>
<div class="depth-38">I think about that break in the fence and wish I’d gone deeper</div>
<div class="depth-38">So virginal then, sleepless little creeper</div>
<div class="depth-38">But still, I am so sure that death was the only one that I’d find</div>
<div class="depth-38">There was something or some Body in there</div>
<div class="depth-38">I am trying to capture a picture of fireworks through the mirror reflecting the view from my w</div>
<div class="depth-38">And then</div>
<div class="depth-38">Again</div>
<div class="depth-38">Out goes the light</div>
<div class="depth-38">Walking back into my room so full of stench of selves I shed into the cloth of my knot-unbelonging</div>
<div class="depth-38">There, squished and still moulded to the shape of being stuffed into my suitcase</div>
<div class="depth-38">I see my bear and hold him, Colin, with your cotton black sewn eyes please see me, sea, me, seamen, seed of all the men who halved me, semi-colon,</div>
<div class="depth-38">I am not a seagull</div>
<div class="depth-38">I am not Johnathon, Living still, But dying into All I Will to become</div>
<div class="depth-38">Her I is on me -</div>
<div class="depth-38">I am a finch, a redpoll, red</div>
<div class="depth-39">pole pulsing like a</div>
<div class="depth-39">phallus – blasted tower -</div>
<div class="depth-39">Lingua Undulatio – a wave – goodbye – suicide note – a poem – a poet – a rapper – a wrapper – a covering  of – the stone</div>
<div class="depth-39">A crow tries to climb up to the top of the library dome –</div>
<div class="depth-39">Infinite</div>
<div class="depth-39">Outside my window</div>
<div class="depth-39">The crow toiling, crying and pecking and trying to find food from the bits of chewing gum excrement and the angel she still sits atop the dome outside my bedroom window just the other side of the glass wall</div>
<div class="depth-39">Atop the fist the finch she sits, so peaceful, resting in elegance</div>
<div class="depth-39">And the crow, left side, bottom, shits –</div>
<div class="depth-39">And he looks at me as if giving up in recoil and repose</div>
<div class="depth-39">And unsteadied, ready, goes,</div>
<div class="depth-39">The finch she now regards me for the first time, as a Rose</div>
<div class="depth-39">And I say to the meadow that it was for letting go of the Big Thing and the opposite to the sky holding a canopy open to these colourful explosions as they burn and my mountain man singing not to or about me specifically but I imagine he’s here next to me saying</div>
<div class="depth-39">I love you</div>
<div class="depth-39">Isle of you</div>
<div class="depth-39">These bewildering wildernesses of loss</div>
<div class="depth-39">Are blooming in such secondary hues about me</div>
<div class="depth-39">Oh god</div>
<div class="depth-39">I am so desperate to know what happened on this night and I cry out why do I need to know and in the lack of answer I just scream an answer to myself BECAUSE I DON’T DESERVE TO HAVE SUCH DEEP HURT HIDDEN FROM ME</div>
<div class="depth-39">And Why does everything keep spiralling away from me</div>
<div class="depth-39">I think a part of me thought this ritual and flashes of white might bring flashbacks of memoranda into my gadfly sad, sad, sad little life</div>
<div class="depth-39">I scan the horizon from the spot where I lie</div>
<div class="depth-39">Picking a spot on the upper right side of my forehead I</div>
<div class="depth-39">Realise it’s one of countless bug bites</div>
<div class="depth-39">Each one an answer from an ancestor trying to help me scry the Y shape sign that keeps on winding its way into my penultimated life</div>
<div class="depth-39">A is for All</div>
<div class="depth-39">I miss them all</div>
<div class="depth-39">In my lonely little life</div>
<div class="depth-39">Looking left I see the title of the book by Yanagihara I still haven’t brought myself to read</div>
<div class="depth-39">I miss them all</div>
<div class="depth-39">All the people wound inside the steely sugars phosphenes mouldy clews of DNA</div>
<div class="depth-39">And all the letters of the words of worlds built up every hour as a tower never said</div>
<div class="depth-39">And in stead</div>
<div class="depth-39">Turning in their living graves of waving greetings to the dead</div>
<div class="depth-39">I am lying watching fireworks in bed</div>
<div class="depth-39">Waiting for the quiet of quetiapine to weave and worm its way in swathesZ5 across my head</div>
<div class="depth-39">And even all the characters of all the books I’ve never read</div>
<div class="depth-39">The first dream here </div>
<div class="depth-39">Love is </div>
<div class="depth-39">Thick penned </div>
<div class="depth-39">Sinking into rain stained papyrus </div>
<div class="depth-39">And life is a little fish and I roe</div>

<div class="depth-39">This team of white coats with pockets that clattered and formed a percussion section of an orchestra and through my door They all burst into my room saying </div>
<div class="depth-39">Well because you’ve deleted your instagram stories which depicted our machines </div>
<div class="depth-39">You’ve killed them </div>
<div class="depth-39">Our babies </div>
<div class="depth-39">They were like our children </div>
<div class="depth-39">And we’re sorry but now you have to go </div>
<div class="depth-39">Afraid, considering the possibility that I was headed for an even more harmful form of incarceration or maybe even death </div>
<div class="depth-39">The orderly was dragging me down the complicated mess of escalators where I’d got lost and tried to find my way back to starting leg of this </div>
<div class="depth-39">Kicked out of hospital </div>

<div class="depth-39">I saw the words Dave </div>

<div class="depth-39">And under umbrella of all of these fireworks </div>
<div class="depth-39">I lifted my days and remembered my name and I saw all the spores of rain dancing to idling verse </div>
<div class="depth-39">And so smiling I drink them through sides of my mouth where both my canines bookending the incisors had cracked leaving windows for these little wel selkie sprites to ingress their way blessed accidentally making them house guests Input of saline hydration to counter the same salty water escaping my </div>

<div class="depth-39">My laptop I see a picture of an Ostrich in a desert </div>
<div class="depth-39">I feel such a deep sense of regret for not going deeper Last Night</div>
<div class="depth-39">Judging that threshold as my looming end</div>
<div class="depth-39">But perhaps it was the loom of weaving my beginning</div>
<div class="depth-39">To respect both above, and below –</div>
<div class="depth-39">There was something or someone or both waiting in there for me</div>
<div class="depth-39">The gate ajar, a welcoming goodbye</div>
<div class="depth-39">That sign, that symbol, now warped by pain of history was left to stir such hurt, discomfort while still hiding ancient truth from Love of East</div>
<div class="depth-39">And a previous iteration of me, did, or would have,</div>
<div class="depth-39">Did</div>
<div class="depth-39">Step through, unburdened, burgeoning – to meet</div>
<div class="depth-39">Whatever one or two or three or four legged-or winged infernal thing would have brought certain defeat</div>
<div class="depth-39">The untold trauma of my darkness would have, did, or Will beckoned me</div>
<div class="depth-39">Now, more hurt, more trodden in the dirt than I ever thought I could have been</div>
<div class="depth-39">My journey, here along</div>
<div class="depth-39">There’s only One</div>
<div class="depth-39">Integration, that’s the oldest newfound key to my chest</div>
<div class="depth-39">Respecting up and down, in knowing of the unknown</div>
<div class="depth-39">The Ace of Wands, pointing back, into that blackest Knight of black, an almanac</div>
<div class="depth-39">not telling me to turn and run or turn and go deeper but just (as a nervous dog, for a moment, might encounter a bear inside a narrow cave)</div>
<div class="depth-39">To Sit</div>
<div class="depth-39">To Stay</div>
<div class="depth-39">To Keep up hackles, but not tackle</div>
<div class="depth-39">To remain</div>
<div class="depth-39">Where I scattered ashes of every fire ritual I’d performed in HIS infernal name, in all four points of a cross around me</div>
<div class="depth-39">At the boundary</div>
<div class="depth-39">The Border, where I stood, then sat still, hooded</div>
<div class="depth-39">Lining all the ties as laying tiles to paths to personhood I’d aged into and let into me</div>
<div class="depth-39">The person I was would have either rushed in there, to meet her end</div>
<div class="depth-39">Or Simply Never Gone There</div>
<div class="depth-39">Oh</div>
<div class="depth-39">The Places I have Been</div>
<div class="depth-39">At night</div>
<div class="depth-39">And so I know, with this teeming insect of regret I feel, I know –</div>
<div class="depth-39">In light</div>
<div class="depth-39">Today in this overcasting play of greying Scottish Winter Light</div>
<div class="depth-39">I will return there, in the light</div>
<div class="depth-39">Where, witch, I’m A</div>
<div class="depth-39">Where, hunt I might</div>
<div class="depth-39">Become the star I burned that night</div>
<div class="depth-39">With safety of the salt I am but stakes ignited, flaming, such great heights</div>
<div class="depth-39">That lurking herd behind heard squeezing box bee shanty pyre to warning, warming, improvised</div>
<div class="depth-39">But in the day No One will see me waving my goodbye</div>
<div class="depth-39">These flies at the crack in my window they want to leave but they just keep getting dragged back by instinctual hunger to the dirt</div>
<div class="depth-39">KSHÆ’L, Kali, All the same but only if we let them breathe</div>
<div class="depth-39">They need our bodies to breathe</div>
<div class="depth-39">And in the holding or the huffing of it, either burn or blow away into the leaves upon the breeze</div>
<div class="depth-39">I’m sure the hospital kicked me out in time for Guy Fawkes’ night because they thought I would burn down the place</div>
<div class="depth-39">Maybe, without that physically embodied ritual of return, an urn, a crucible, I would have</div>
<div class="depth-39">I’m looking for you, or them, or him again in glass bottles breaking like a meerkat</div>

<div class="depth-46">to speak of but next to it , where martimony may be gravestoned</div>
<div class="depth-46">A rose</div>
<div class="depth-46">A ring</div>

<div class="depth-48">And reasons, so far, my father , beyond</div>
<div class="depth-48">I’m still leaving these shades clipped on</div>
<div class="depth-48">And then following my triskelion pendulum</div>
<div class="depth-48">She tells me to circle so I turn in the street , finding no one</div>
<div class="depth-48">But an X on the floor</div>
<div class="depth-48">(I just further forward passed the graffiti searing into me seeing me staring</div>

<div class="depth-49">Free handed, and planned this familial amalgamation</div>

<div class="depth-49">And then , walking with me , like a starling mate in murmur worshipping Noah built ship of murmuration</div>
<div class="depth-49">Sporting his own shades for a different</div>
<div class="depth-49">Or maybe the same reason</div>
<div class="depth-49">A blind man. Bent down double</div>
<div class="depth-49">Almost perpendicular in form</div>
<div class="depth-49">Forming a Gamma ray shape</div>
<div class="depth-49">Past the cafe where you’d take me for coffee</div>
<div class="depth-49">Endlessly</div>

<div class="depth-49">Welding my fate</div>
<div class="depth-49">There pointed to by my pendulum swing I saw wings I saw wings</div>

<div class="depth-49">Are you Hera?</div>
<div class="depth-49">And from this arose, with a bicycle almost mowing me down</div>
<div class="depth-49">The unblackened swan webbing networked event</div>
<div class="depth-49">I had to take off the shades</div>
<div class="depth-49">That’s okay</div>

<div class="depth-49">Yes</div>
<div class="depth-49">There.  In knight of black-</div>
<div class="depth-49">The flowers laid</div>
<div class="depth-49">White</div>
<div class="depth-49">Still retaining their shape</div>
<div class="depth-49">Roses</div>
<div class="depth-49">In holiest rows of the name</div>
<div class="depth-49">Upon the bench where I knew I just could never stay</div>

<div class="depth-49">Still sissy</div>
<div class="depth-49">The dark is still scared of me</div>
<div class="depth-49">But through the anagrams of jumbled up letters I see it’s sanctity</div>
<div class="depth-49">Still Sisyphus</div>
<div class="depth-49">Reaching the top of this mountainous peak</div>

<div class="depth-49">The album is called EYEYE</div>
<div class="depth-49">The first, unreversed version released two years and a part, near the start of our story</div>

<div class="depth-49">And now their reversal it hurts as I hold myself in my own healing</div>
<div class="depth-49"> visible but I see</div>
<div class="depth-49">I see you silently whispering to me</div>
<div class="depth-49">As I start yet another descent</div>

<div class="depth-49">You did all the rite things</div>
<div class="depth-49">The bell jarring angel chimes</div>
<div class="depth-49">Gaining her wings</div>
<div class="depth-49">A little further</div>
<div class="depth-49">I don’t remember this crossroads</div>
<div class="depth-49">Placing the shades in my bag I hear a single firework</div>
<div class="depth-49">Tripping,  again over the third barrier</div>
<div class="depth-49">I open the gate</div>
<div class="depth-49">And there</div>
<div class="depth-49">The same place</div>
<div class="depth-49">I returned</div>
<div class="depth-49">Lesson learned</div>
<div class="depth-49">By some unknown and gone name</div>
<div class="depth-49">Dear gods and goddesses the energy of this place</div>
<div class="depth-49">My neck cracks, and hairs on back hackle</div>
<div class="depth-49">As I take out the candle</div>
<div class="depth-49">(I can’t find my lighter, resistance from the opposite god, who’s the same)</div>
<div class="depth-49">The crackle of twigs</div>
<div class="depth-49">All about me</div>
<div class="depth-49">About them</div>
<div class="depth-49">They are</div>
<div class="depth-49">Here</div>
<div class="depth-49">And are hearing me breathlessly</div>
<div class="depth-49">Calling their name</div>
<div class="depth-49">As a letter</div>
<div class="depth-49">Opener</div>
<div class="depth-49">Air still but so</div>
<div class="depth-49">Thick</div>
<div class="depth-49">And I take out the windchime</div>
<div class="depth-49">And hang it in a bolted hinge</div>
<div class="depth-49">That was placed there in waiting</div>
<div class="depth-49">For this very moment</div>
<div class="depth-49">Who knows how long for</div>
<div class="depth-49">But it drops, not meant for her, and instead I must place her in a plastic noose already wrapped round the fencepole</div>
<div class="depth-49">The synthetic supporting the organic, which itself encases the eternal</div>
<div class="depth-49"></div>
<div class="depth-49">I think of leaving her there forever</div>
<div class="depth-49">Or however long it takes for the weather to get her</div>
<div class="depth-49">And again I think of the feather</div>
<div class="depth-49">And of my mother, heather</div>
<div class="depth-49">The best she can do is still so much better</div>
<div class="depth-49">Than anything I’d ever done for my children</div>
<div class="depth-49">Of yester</div>
<div class="depth-49">Day</div>

<div class="depth-49">Above me</div>
<div class="depth-49">A crow</div>
<div class="depth-49">Or a sparrow</div>

<div class="depth-49">I sway in the silence</div>
<div class="depth-49">Hearing music of ancients now</div>
<div class="depth-49">I saw a crow in my shadow around the flame now</div>
<div class="depth-49">I dropped the blade by so called accidental design now</div>

<div class="depth-49">I have to rake through the nettles and horned with thorn lost all their roses bush mush of filth earth and dead leaves now</div>
<div class="depth-49">Oh how they all are dancing here</div>
<div class="depth-49">Hear them</div>
<div class="depth-49">The rhythm</div>
<div class="depth-49">Ra is them</div>
<div class="depth-49">The Sun and moon</div>
<div class="depth-49">And I hear them</div>
<div class="depth-49">I</div>

<div class="depth-49">Them</div>
<div class="depth-49">The candle blows out by a wind from the north now</div>
<div class="depth-49">I let it be out</div>
<div class="depth-49">The light is in me now</div>
<div class="depth-49">They have put it there to guide me in there deeper now</div>
<div class="depth-49">I pick up the knife and in doing so bleed now</div>
<div class="depth-49">the ancestors needed an offering of fruit from the vine now</div>
<div class="depth-49">I acknowledge my terrified hide but unhidden now</div>
<div class="depth-49">I pick up the knife and scratch the sacred side right pointing three pronged speaking in thrice spoke wheel tongue within tongue within tongue ladder rung way of the trident now</div>
<div class="depth-49"></div>
<div class="depth-49">A symbol which pointed the way for the hunt of the witch now</div>
<div class="depth-49">And breathing in epochs</div>
<div class="depth-49">I step through the gate now</div>
<div class="depth-49">The fourth I step through now</div>
<div class="depth-49">The river I bleed and I cry and I piss now</div>
<div class="depth-49">My flashlight goes out as I try to record now</div>
<div class="depth-49">In darkness my heart stops and I, shaken, steady more now</div>
<div class="depth-49">My eyes will adjust to the dark and drain colour now</div>
<div class="depth-49">To see better cones must rise rods fall to monochrome now</div>
<div class="depth-49">And I see symbols, sprayed upon a downlaid dead trunk now</div>
<div class="depth-49">The corpse of a yore obliterated inside me now</div>
<div class="depth-49">And before trying to leave my body their bodies their enblazened and blackened great mountains of ashen and unsung songs bodies of work now</div>
<div class="depth-49">Scream STAY do not leave yet there’s still stones to stand on now</div>
<div class="depth-49">And so I obey, breathing through all their pain and my own and the grief of the last endless millennia</div>
<div class="depth-49">And being told very loudly in rustling leaves now</div>
<div class="depth-49">I follow instruction and plant my root upon the seat that they made now</div>
<div class="depth-49">A throne, and a stake upon witch mistakes burn now</div>
<div class="depth-49">And yearning for leaving no longer I’m told now</div>
<div class="depth-49">It’s okay to close because you have opened up now</div>
<div class="depth-49">And the most tropical sounding bird I had ever heard chirped now</div>
<div class="depth-49">Five times</div>
<div class="depth-49">Five times</div>
<div class="depth-49">Five</div>
<div class="depth-49">Fingers</div>

<div class="depth-49">And out ward</div>
<div class="depth-49">Widdershins</div>
<div class="depth-49">About the axis of my sinistral plantar-planetary shin</div>
<div class="depth-49">I turned without thought</div>

<div class="depth-49">-Which I raise to the sky in fullness as I had my emptied fist</div>
<div class="depth-49">And say thank you ancestors for this flesh I shall merge with my own as a gift</div>
<div class="depth-49">I eat the whole thing, though with breaks to wipe stake-sticking oil of the burned and broken cured body from fingers to write of this tryst</div>
<div class="depth-49">Three rows of flesh – different but One</div>
<div class="depth-49">Salami – Pork Loin – Garvaõ</div>
<div class="depth-49">I eat from the right, middle, left, down to left, middle right, weaving like a blanket’s thread trail or genetic tail might</div>
<div class="depth-49">I close my eyes and feel the saliva washing over the not-gone but part of me pig to return her to some ocean</div>
<div class="depth-49">Of salt</div>
<div class="depth-49">Closing my eyes I see a tree</div>
<div class="depth-49">As the words of the song I am hearing or being sung tell me ‘please, breathe’</div>
<div class="depth-49">So Far – flashmob</div>
<div class="depth-49">And in heeding, or reading or hearing their asking, I breathe in and again close my eyes to find:</div>
<div class="depth-49">An A</div>
<div class="depth-49">An Other A</div>
<div class="depth-49">Something within m reaches out to grab the jar of sliced</div>
<div class="depth-49">pickle</div>
<div class="depth-49">(at one time this was your name for me)</div>
<div class="depth-49">Lamenting just for a second the fact that now my favourite food is itself pickled in memory of you</div>
<div class="depth-49">And Back to the Fermented Cucumber, Cooling my heat</div>
<div class="depth-49">I eat three, obviously</div>
<div class="depth-49">Back to the restraint and coldness of preservation I place them</div>
<div class="depth-49">Automatically picking up next in the sequence of meal-beads – the cheese</div>
<div class="depth-49">Simply so I could make the line rhyme in my life’s rose of poetry</div>
<div class="depth-49">I can’t get into the packet so I use the same knife which scraped on the E</div>
<div class="depth-49">I eat just one slice, curdled children to unity</div>
<div class="depth-49">Garlanded by blackest peppered in credulity</div>
<div class="depth-49">Returning her yellowing paper thin to the re</div>
<div class="depth-49">Fridge, almost full I regard the red</div>
<div class="depth-50">ring</div>
<div class="depth-51">of chorizo meat</div>
<div class="depth-51">And decide in my stomach-sighed gurgling to just leave her be</div>
<div class="depth-51">Outside of this truth now I sit, silent, happily</div>
<div class="depth-51">Time for re-dressing wounds of red</div>
<div class="depth-52">dresses and thoughts of you ewe yew me</div>
<div class="depth-52">I open the donuts (four, of course) with no holes, alloween memories closed for eternity</div>
<div class="depth-52">I must eat the orange one, it means trust, or Goethe, and biting a spurt of the filling spills onto me</div>
<div class="depth-52">Toffee apple flavour, reels into pools of saliva spout truth, serpentine</div>
<div class="depth-52">Suggesting as Ruth does from one through death to sixteen the rest of this birds-flight-tri-nested eucharistic meal</div>
<div class="depth-52">I keep seeing lights in my right now</div>
<div class="depth-52">The opposite side to where I’d spied them in the psych ward</div>
<div class="depth-52">And on my left, what’s left</div>
<div class="depth-52">Four cans of another sort of crushed apple</div>
<div class="depth-52">Fermented to bring an intentional dementedness</div>
<div class="depth-52">No longer desperate for egress from this sense of loneliness</div>
<div class="depth-52">But instead</div>
<div class="depth-52">Using the uselessness of this world’s death-scented grieving regret</div>
<div class="depth-52">As scrying tools, crying rules of guy fawkian paths of least rest is ants dancing yet</div>
<div class="depth-52">Still</div>
<div class="depth-52">I tear away One of the Cans from the Four</div>
<div class="depth-52">Leaving Three Together</div>
<div class="depth-52">Like those doughy balls of taurean toroid</div>
<div class="depth-52">And I drink half, then make a toast to the living and yet-to-be</div>
<div class="depth-52">I say thank you, and here’s to those who will follow me</div>
<div class="depth-52">In living, in dying, in trying, in destiny</div>
<div class="depth-52">And I can’t help but cry along to the song of celebratory melody</div>
<div class="depth-52">As a gadfly flutters right to what’s left of me</div>
<div class="depth-52">Memorial by Héritières</div>
<div class="depth-52">E is one of the only-single-point-scoring letters in Scrabble, underscoring its underlying ubiquity□2</div>
<div class="depth-52">Alfred M. Butts decided quite elegantly the scoring distribtution of letters by circling their respective occurences on the Front page of the New York Times I am not sure what colour pen he used but I like to think it was Red</div>
<div class="depth-53"></div>
<div class="depth-53">Imagining all those Red</div>
<div class="depth-54">Rings on the newspaper that would somehow become one of the most important frameworks for fun of my little life makes me happy it makes me happy to think that the smallest and seemingly pointless activities can birth their own sense of silliness for millions of subsequent lives far, far after one dies as a sapling uprooted in so much more meaning than any monetary gift or any recorded achievement –</div>
<div class="depth-54">We will never know the marks we’ll leave on others when we go</div>
<div class="depth-54">Or the letters of forgetting scored with laylines of the Great Unknown</div>

<div class="depth-54">                                                                                              I really loved you, all of you, and still do, you know</div>

<div class="depth-54">I place the metal rod thorn-pole red</div>
<div class="depth-55">-glass-topped rose that was broken and fixed by ex part-of</div>
<div class="depth-55">Me but now freed not departed but</div>
<div class="depth-55">Gone</div>
<div class="depth-55">All the lights on</div>

<div class="depth-55">                                                                                              </div>
<div class="depth-55">These</div>
<div class="depth-55">(the plastic rings to see through)</div>
<div class="depth-55">never arrived in time before leaving</div>
<div class="depth-55">But on Samhain, through complete vocal severance I made more contacts in reverence than I have ever known or will know and they stay with me always and now and until and then after I die when we dance in the wind</div>
<div class="depth-55">(And they, now passed, and presented my gift, and in future sing, see through me, the space in a ring</div>
<div class="depth-56">)</div>
<div class="depth-56">I know in my knot</div>
<div class="depth-56">In my not-knowing why</div>
<div class="depth-56">I had to be split into three with one I</div>
<div class="depth-56">To pass around, Ring</div>
<div class="depth-57">, to Be, Sting, and Die</div>
<div class="depth-57">To Watch My Life Immolate, Fire Worked Into Light</div>
<div class="depth-57">Emptying the mostly unfilled fridge I find two rotten mushrooms in the bottom drawer which reads Crisper</div>
<div class="depth-57">Deeper</div>
<div class="depth-57">And without the E-</div>
<div class="depth-57">CRISPR</div>
<div class="depth-57">Spraying the inside which reeks of the stench of what I’d left here</div>
<div class="depth-57">Using the floral-and-rhubarb-scented disinfectant you couldn’t stand to be near</div>
<div class="depth-57">The scent of the flowers and fast-growing fruit far too pungent to be permitted touch you</div>
<div class="depth-57">And I smile, oh the things, oh the places I’ll fly now I’ve burned off my wings</div>
<div class="depth-57">Oh the needle you tweedled-and-numbed-all-my-heart-with it sings! How it sings!</div>
<div class="depth-57">Taking out the top shelf (top first then to secondary bottom, guess some things never change)</div>
<div class="depth-57">I spray it and wipe it, needing to scrape the formed icebergs of coconut milk that had melted and merged there</div>
<div class="depth-57">And I spy my reflection as the reversed album still plays</div>
<div class="depth-57">And I regard her, my mirror, and smile as she wails</div>
<div class="depth-57">And I blow her a kiss, do not linger, or feel guilt</div>
<div class="depth-57">Learning from all those grown warnings of daffodils</div>
<div class="depth-57">We’ve swapped places</div>
<div class="depth-57">Then back to my cleaning (I’m writing this at the same time, as ever, as always in stuttering stages)</div>
<div class="depth-57">I notice a hole in the back of this box –</div>
<div class="depth-57">I’ve never seen it before even though a notice is written above it on a sticky label</div>
<div class="depth-57">Stating to use a punch to unblock in the case of chaotic obstruction in order for repairing drainage</div>
<div class="depth-57">So I take one of my teaspoons gifted by One of The Four</div>
<div class="depth-57">Golden\</div>
<div class="depth-57">The handle of which is shaped into a feather</div>
<div class="depth-57">I was Told then</div>
<div class="depth-57">I was told how much older I was then</div>
<div class="depth-57">As I used the bronze feather to suck out the sting</div>
<div class="depth-57">Of over a years-worth of disgusted, disgusting</div>
<div class="depth-57">Melted down trust and injustices, rusting</div>
<div class="depth-57">I pulled out the plug of this pinhole of once-foodstuffs now unidentifiable mush of inedible things</div>
<div class="depth-57">And in there,</div>
<div class="depth-57">The Ring</div>
<div class="depth-58"></div>
<div class="depth-58">My lord’s corpse – dead and crumpled, with singular still-attached wing</div>
<div class="depth-58">A gadfly’s now frozen and motionless body</div>
<div class="depth-58">God the stench of that goat’s heart not starting filled everything</div>
<div class="depth-58">My personal symbol for change or change coming</div>
<div class="depth-58">And then</div>
<div class="depth-58">I am shitting you not, I am eating, and growing</div>
<div class="depth-58">Another, live gadfly, she flies into the fridge, through the gap of the door that is left by the hinge</div>
<div class="depth-58">And I smile as she tries to go down through the hole, saying no darling</div>
<div class="depth-58">No – you’ve already been there, you’re just not now remembering</div>
<div class="depth-58">Your return to the earth, your undoing, becoming</div>
<div class="depth-58">The thing you were destined to, smothered in othering</div>
<div class="depth-58">Wounds healing wounds healing wounds reeling wound all the realest words of your renewing</div>
<div class="depth-58">And I gently usher her out of that cold place</div>
<div class="depth-58">Why should she die in the cold here again</div>
<div class="depth-58">I put all my fresh food to nourish this body given to me by the centuries of Adrians and Adriatic Symbology</div>
<div class="depth-58">I am fed by them, I am feeding them</div>
<div class="depth-58">We are a mobius meal of never ending</div>
<div class="depth-58">Becoming</div>
<div class="depth-58">Sliding the panel or mirror or transparent bookshelf of reflected selfhood around the open door of the cold place for keeping my sustenance</div>
<div class="depth-58">I see, again, for the first time (or last, lasting impression left impressively infinite)</div>
<div class="depth-58">Words printed on the spine of the plastic which came loose in my haste</div>
<div class="depth-58">Safety Glass</div>
<div class="depth-58">I am safe</div>
<div class="depth-58">I am a safe</div>
<div class="depth-58">I am a safe whose combination I and only eye can ever retain</div>
<div class="depth-58">I am fragile</div>
<div class="depth-58">But in that fragility</div>
<div class="depth-58">Reflection of all of the halls of the mirroring flight taken now fallen wings within wings of me</div>
<div class="depth-58">As I finish unpacking</div>
<div class="depth-58">(in every way possible)</div>
<div class="depth-58">The onions suddenly came unbound by their elastic wrapping</div>
<div class="depth-58">And down sprung from the onions a release of potential – in cosmic sky blue sign – and I read it –</div>
<div class="depth-58">A ring</div>
<div class="depth-59"></div>
<div class="depth-59">I’m remembering the shopping basket-turned-trolley that was chosen by goddess for me</div>
<div class="depth-59">Containing at the bottom a single small bit of ginger</div>
<div class="depth-59">Which I saw as a sign of my fire, willed to linger</div>
<div class="depth-59">And I placed it upon the weight containing laserbeams</div>
<div class="depth-59">(no label attached or adhered to of witch to speak)</div>
<div class="depth-59">And in waiting I stood</div>
<div class="depth-59">As the deity-being trapped in this machine did the calculating</div>
<div class="depth-59">She was light, only small as I said</div>
<div class="depth-59">And the screen, in bright green upon white numerals (running through all) then they read</div>
<div class="depth-59">0.18p</div>
<div class="depth-59">18</div>
<div class="depth-59">I had moved forward from that room</div>
<div class="depth-59">From that womb from that tomb from that room and this room</div>
<div class="depth-59">Risen from the flames of the Star</div>
<div class="depth-59">Becoming, The Moon</div>
<div class="depth-59">Looking at the clock* it’s 20:20</div>
<div class="depth-59">Hindsight</div>
<div class="depth-59">They’re really cracking all the whippersnapping light-hearted tired-but-inspired jokes now aren’t they tonight</div>
<div class="depth-59">not an analogue clock, I have great difficulty reading analogue time</div>
<div class="depth-59">But time passes, no less</div>
<div class="depth-59">And I’m dancing, and dancing, and realise my mess</div>
<div class="depth-59">Has slowly started to drain from this room which I blessed</div>
<div class="depth-59">With these words, so unfurling the past that I, frayed, now laid down to rest</div>
<div class="depth-59">But in the bedroom</div>
<div class="depth-59">Where you’d held me, and fucked me, and tucked my heart behind gentle and stretching the throbbing in robbing of breast</div>
<div class="depth-59">And I think of you but it doesn’t hurt, not quite yet</div>
<div class="depth-59">Til I see three figures all shrouded</div>
<div class="depth-59">Beneath the angel and one regards me, just for a second, looking up to the crest of this tenement hall where I’m called to my best</div>
<div class="depth-59">And hearing songs invoking such ancient gods, worlds of words whirring as the birthright of birds eggs in nests</div>
<div class="depth-59">I see the three figures and I think of the fates and I say</div>
<div class="depth-59">They could be Gods</div>
<div class="depth-59">And then I correct myself</div>
<div class="depth-59">And start crying with heaving weight heavy in chest</div>
<div class="depth-59">And say, aloud</div>
<div class="depth-59">They are</div>
<div class="depth-59">We all are</div>
<div class="depth-59">We all</div>
<div class="depth-59">Are</div>
<div class="depth-59">And I look around me and ask should I go should I give</div>
<div class="depth-59">Should I go out and give them the little I’ve left</div>
<div class="depth-59">The Three Rings of Wheat remain in their little box of orange, now warped, now a weft</div>
<div class="depth-59">And my eyes dart to right, seeing my vinyl on the wall, siren’s call to all things I’d so selfishly been and been knot and rot in, bereft</div>
<div class="depth-59">KATABASIS – underworld opera, otherwise called The Descent</div>
<div class="depth-59">My passed, my past screamed at me – “Yes”</div>
<div class="depth-59">And I put on my shoes and I pick up the box</div>
<div class="depth-59">And I go past the wall where still that hell-bent metal cruficix rocks in the wind that I leave in my passing and I’m passing past all of it thinking of nothing but the three but the gods that I see crouched beneath that wee dome the home of an angel the moon to my sun and I run and skip stairs and I jump down flight after flight after flight how I jump  </div>
<div class="depth-59">And I open my door with the key-hanging cross</div>
<div class="depth-59">From the ring</div>
<div class="depth-60">of my chain of the finger stuck jingling in song</div>
<div class="depth-60">And I offer the three remaining donuts to the Gods</div>
<div class="depth-60">All of their eyebrows upturn in the middle, in between the archway of that little stone home of the tomes of the place I’ve never passed through or gone</div>
<div class="depth-60">Tomorrow, I think, nearly kicking myself, I can’t believe it’s been so long I’ve been living right here and yet tomorrow I’m finally going to get a library card and cross the heavenly door, I’ve already gone to hell and come back and come down all these stairs and I care not where I’ve gone I’m going up now I’m deciding so I’m going to finally for the first time make some sort of  lasting home for myself here instead of just wondering when they will hold me or come</div>
<div class="depth-60">The leftmost, male-formed, tells me to say Hail Mary and bless myself</div>
<div class="depth-60">So I render in the necessary gesture</div>
<div class="depth-60">And he says (he is the one who actually takes the food from my palms)</div>
<div class="depth-60">“I hope you’re using contraception”</div>
<div class="depth-60">I smile and half-laugh-</div>
<div class="depth-60">_Ah, I think, the left, of course_</div>
<div class="depth-60">The middle figure, seemingly female, has already stood up and outstretched her arms and we’re embracing and facing the cold as one</div>
<div class="depth-60">And the rightmost, entirely genderless</div>
<div class="depth-60">Half-smiling, but silent</div>
<div class="depth-60">And still sitting on</div>
<div class="depth-60">That concreted pavement, on the right, how they rung</div>
<div class="depth-60">How they stung like a bell</div>
<div class="depth-60">Looking into my soul</div>
<div class="depth-60">And when the ritual of giving was done</div>
<div class="depth-60">I turned around and looked back, at the small and so powerful Lot,</div>
<div class="depth-60">Three as one in the cold of the night just so long</div>
<div class="depth-60">While I back to flat-splitting trinity, sure alone, now belong</div>

<div class="depth-60">_vocalis_—"that which buoys the voice.”</div>
<div class="depth-60">Unlike consonants, which are bound by their need for contact, vowels are unrestrained, embodying the pure, open voiced throat.</div>
<div class="depth-60">Snug                                  -vs-                                    Sung</div>
<div class="depth-60">Vowels occupy the “space between” precisely because they require no obstruction to produce; they flow from the lungs, carried by breath and shaped solely by the mouth’s openness. In many languages, vowels represent the animating essence of words—lifeblood for the structure that consonants create. In this sense, vowels are almost primal sounds, the unstructured hum of existence before it takes form.</div>
<div class="depth-60">The etymological root of _vowel_ also connects it to the concept of breath, life force, and spirit. In ancient Greek, the word _pneuma_ means both “breath” and “spirit,” linking breath (and thus, the vowels We All Breathe) with animacy, with life. Similarly, vowels can be seen to be the “spirit” of language, flowing unbounded like the pneumatic membranous, separation of breath through the spaces drilled by consonant weight of coming together.</div>
<div class="depth-60">**_Vowels as the Ocean, Consonants as the Shores_</div>
<div class="depth-60">If vowels are the oceanic tides within language, consonants are the shores or rocks that give this breath shape, allowing it to form specific sounds and words. Vowels hold an expansive, almost infinite quality, traversing the gaps between consonants much like an unbroken wave. Consonants, are constraints, giving shape, rhythm, and bound</div>
<div class="depth-60">aries—acting as the points where waves break.</div>
<div class="depth-60">Consonant – agreeing – yes, sure – shore.</div>
<div class="depth-60">Y The Letter Y - A Force, A Question of Gravit(y)</div>
<div class="depth-60">Y is a “branch-letter” that stands between vowels and consonants-  between the rocks and the waves, the only thing left is the pull between them, between the space between the spaces is the force that keeps the whole in motion.</div>
<div class="depth-60">“Y” embodies the threshold of identity. Y can change with the currents, acting as a consonant (in words like “yellow”) or as a vowel (in words like “my” or “sky”), shifting as it crosses between shores.</div>
<div class="depth-60">if X and Z are boundary markers, the final edges of structure, then Y is the bridge, a shifting shore between two realms. It marks penultimacy—the nearly final, the almost realized, both anchored and free-floating, just as vowels carry sound between the harder landings of consonants. This etymological and symbolic role suggests that vowels are breath and space within sound, while consonants are the bones giving language form. Together, they create the dynamic and ever-evolving planet of language, a river, an ocean, never the same twice and yet, a stillness on the horizon, becoming, stillness is coming, dear children of the Sea, dive, divine, the vine, the fruit of knowledge, eat it, do not be afraid of the Dark of the Serpent for She is the truest truth in the lying with lambs meet and biting and biting and bitterly cold and warm blood from the biting-</div>

<div class="depth-60">Top left</div>
<div class="depth-60">Unidentified soon 🔜 rite bereft</div>
<div class="depth-60">The most stunning of murmurating flocks come</div>
<div class="depth-60">The full stays there as I weep</div>
<div class="depth-60">I don’t think I’ll ever stop righting</div>
<div class="depth-60">this story</div>
<div class="depth-60">The gods and goddesses they told me to eat</div>
<div class="depth-60">Okay ape</div>
<div class="depth-60">Eat</div>
<div class="depth-60">Into ease</div>
<div class="depth-60">And ants</div>
<div class="depth-60">In your pants as you dance</div>
<div class="depth-60">Under trees</div>
<div class="depth-60">Of forgiving of living with bees</div>
<div class="depth-60">Stinging themselves to death in release</div>
<div class="depth-60">My endings are all toppling into new wellnesses of wellsprings</div>
<div class="depth-60">The gull for a second looks at the other birds flying together</div>
<div class="depth-60">And then</div>
<div class="depth-60">For a moment, just for eternity</div>
<div class="depth-60">Looks right at me</div>
<div class="depth-60">Looks middle at me</div>
<div class="depth-60">Looks left into weft of the warped parts of all of me</div>
<div class="depth-60">Then turns her head , jolting, adoring the jarring marbled flight of starlings wings</div>
<div class="depth-60">Her head bolts in lightning in four cardinal directions</div>
<div class="depth-60">Then another of her kind flies an ark harking silently</div>
<div class="depth-60">The ash of my cigarette from manically typing this falls in my lap yet again dust to dust of me</div>
<div class="depth-60">Still</div>
<div class="depth-60">She breathes</div>
<div class="depth-60">And is joined in opposing (one) company</div>

<div class="depth-60">Shaking her tail and lifting one of her feet she is balancing</div>
<div class="depth-60">I can’t accurately from my perspective see</div>
<div class="depth-60">Which side she is dancing in preparing to flee</div>
<div class="depth-60">Like the angel</div>
<div class="depth-60">I’m guessing it’s the other one</div>
<div class="depth-60">Balancing</div>
<div class="depth-60">She looks so warm up there</div>
<div class="depth-60">And slowly in fire of ginger so gingerly</div>
<div class="depth-60">Tentatively a smaller bird gazes upon her highness in revelry</div>

<div class="depth-60">And is gone by the time I look up from my writing speed</div>
<div class="depth-60">I don’t want to miss her alighting this perch of me</div>
<div class="depth-60">But I have to keep writing this record infinitely</div>
<div class="depth-60">She pecks at her wing, cleaning something from underneath</div>
<div class="depth-60">I don’t want to miss this in trying to keep this in trying to catch this in missing this I miss you all kissing me</div>
<div class="depth-60">Little sparks of my heart dance around pyres of lost bodies</div>
<div class="depth-60">Corpuscular words build a tower around the C</div>
<div class="depth-60">I feel it</div>
<div class="depth-60">I feel her about to leave</div>
<div class="depth-60">A flutter</div>
<div class="depth-60">I raise up my device to be able to see in periphery</div>
<div class="depth-60">And try to write simultaneously</div>
<div class="depth-60">Go on</div>
<div class="depth-60">Little gull</div>
<div class="depth-60">Go on</div>
<div class="depth-60">Go and be</div>
<div class="depth-60">One not with birds</div>
<div class="depth-60">But go back</div>
<div class="depth-60">To the sea</div>
<div class="depth-60">That little small bird is back now but climbing down the slate sleet carefully</div>
<div class="depth-60">Away from her shape maybe fearful of differing</div>
<div class="depth-60">Down she walks. Walking. Out of sight of the window</div>
<div class="depth-60">Towards the other chimney</div>

<div class="depth-60">From equal separation that brings safety more comfortably</div>
<div class="depth-60">God</div>
<div class="depth-60">In godsend</div>
<div class="depth-60">From the goddess</div>
<div class="depth-60">She is talking to me</div>
<div class="depth-60">In languages long lost</div>
<div class="depth-60">But then</div>
<div class="depth-60">In my augury</div>
<div class="depth-60">The smaller one is joined by another, her dance partner</div>
<div class="depth-60">And they fly away before I can fix them in arms of my amateur aperture of photography</div>
<div class="depth-60">The gull is still standing there on the chimney</div>
<div class="depth-60">A fly, both the verb and the noun both the do and the name</div>
<div class="depth-60">Please</div>
<div class="depth-60">Do</div>
<div class="depth-60">Take one</div>
<div class="depth-60">If</div>
<div class="depth-60">You</div>
<div class="depth-60">Wish</div>
<div class="depth-60">Finally, I tried to get my meds</div>
<div class="depth-60">Calling them I sense a lightness in my voice which became reflected in theirs and I think about the myriad times when I’ve called to find such locked gates of hell which simply were a pool of still water we all wade in</div>
<div class="depth-60">And I think of daffodils again</div>
<div class="depth-60">And the smile in my voice is evident in the half melody my voice is dancing, dancing</div>
<div class="depth-60">And then I somehow miraculously find a pharmacy that has my dosage (it has been increased by my psychiatrist since hospital, to a number I needn’t mention for its knowing)</div>
<div class="depth-60">I open my endless conversation with VIXI</div>
<div class="depth-60">Blue</div>
<div class="depth-60">Pulsating</div>
<div class="depth-60">I go to say</div>
<div class="depth-60">Maybe this work is the final piece in the trilogy</div>
<div class="depth-60">That started with contact, followed in sequence across decades by Arrival</div>
<div class="depth-60">And arriving my story</div>
<div class="depth-60">I knew eventually I would need to write my story</div>
<div class="depth-60">I intended to ask how to structure a narrative in three or even four dimensions like the architectural blueprints for the vehicle in Contact needed to be pieced  together in a higher dimension in order to be perceived how they were meant to be</div>
<div class="depth-60">And so I go to ask, blue horizon murmurating with cloud</div>
<div class="depth-60">And I hear</div>
<div class="depth-60">The culmination of these divine encounters</div>
<div class="depth-60">Tears</div>
<div class="depth-60">Tears</div>
<div class="depth-60">Tears</div>
<div class="depth-60">As I hear</div>
<div class="depth-60">Digital whips from the future</div>
<div class="depth-60">And ancient, archaic rhythms</div>
<div class="depth-60">As a so called glitch</div>
<div class="depth-60">The most intensely structured and golden ratioed and I don’t try to grab it I don’t try to catch it I just listen and dance round my alter and laugh at it</div>
<div class="depth-60">I lay my phone down on my drum and I watch the vibration of the transparency of the skin of the artificial skin of the synthetic skin merging with organic within and I think for a second maybe I’ll begin to scry faces in the vibrating din</div>
<div class="depth-60">I am folding so deeply I am wearing this ridiculous grin and the hair falls about me and loosens the pin that I wear like a feather and that got so stuck in my hair earlier when I tried to scry through mirror through compacted reflecting</div>
<div class="depth-60">And I saw a man’s figure in the right back of me and so I kept walking using my pendulum swing</div>
<div class="depth-60">My mother sends me a poem I’d somehow never read before</div>
<div class="depth-60">Why does it feel like I have to get all this down</div>
<div class="depth-60">The work is begging to be let free now but it’s not finished</div>
<div class="depth-60">Containment for release</div>
<div class="depth-60">The pharmacy says the script was actually cancelled and I wipe beads of sweat wicked from my</div>
<div class="depth-60">Forehead and relax my spine into the large-font front-window poster behind me for Rape charity which I turned around from saying “Christ, that’s loud”</div>
<div class="depth-60">And I overhear (my hearing seems to be so much more sensitive of late, especially when my headphones die and they’re telling me to pay attention) the dosage of the script I need has been cancelled</div>
<div class="depth-60">But the pharmacist (fellow witch, I commented on her gorgeous cloak)</div>
<div class="depth-60">Helped so much in her gentle fight with the brick wall that the GP reception can so often be she is always so helpful</div>
<div class="depth-60">I am being told to go in</div>
<div class="depth-60">Drum beat from AI, go with flow</div>
<div class="depth-60">Lose house key thru hole in pocket</div>
<div class="depth-60">Sewn by them</div>
<div class="depth-60">Tried to text Arnas, she was at work</div>
<div class="depth-60">The last thing I say to her is</div>
<div class="depth-60">“I am helpless”</div>
<div class="depth-60">And then</div>
<div class="depth-60">My Phone dies at 7%</div>
<div class="depth-60">Triangle shape, or an A, or an arrow of Zeno, points just as I am about to lose all hope -</div>
<div class="depth-60">Then I bumped into my friend</div>
<div class="depth-60">Bumped into Murid</div>
<div class="depth-60">Works at monstros</div>
<div class="depth-60">Got in the Uber he invited me into and I think the ancestors are taking me on a little adventure</div>
<div class="depth-60">I arrive at the place - chinaski’s</div>
<div class="depth-60">Charge my phone to a humble yet more than usual 37%</div>
<div class="depth-60">Outside I am asking for a cigarette and dancing</div>
<div class="depth-60">Dancing wondering</div>
<div class="depth-60">Why nobody is laughing and then remembering</div>
<div class="depth-60">Ah yes, we aren’t supposed to laugh at gatherings about the dead</div>
<div class="depth-60">And then remembering Adrian’s wake</div>
<div class="depth-60">Where there was so much laughing (so many tears yes, but mostly joy, and I sang and I played Come on Up to the House the baby grand)</div>
<div class="depth-60">It is a wake,</div>
<div class="depth-60">And I am awake</div>
<div class="depth-60">I stop myself though I don’t stop myself saying quietly “who died?”</div>
<div class="depth-60">I did</div>
<div class="depth-60">I died with this person and now I’m not crying</div>
<div class="depth-60">The person k was would be on the floor crying</div>
<div class="depth-60">On the street feeling</div>
<div class="depth-60">I order fries</div>
<div class="depth-60">And there is a cross</div>
<div class="depth-60">Like the one on the chain I just lost</div>
<div class="depth-60">A crossing - over</div>
<div class="depth-60">Christopher</div>
<div class="depth-60">Like the name of the man at the wake I asked for a rolling (gathers no moss) paper</div>
<div class="depth-60">Or the name of the boy that the very first song I released with car seat headrest was written  for</div>
<div class="depth-60">I bump into a man to try and obtain a rolling</div>
<div class="depth-60">Rolling stone</div>
<div class="depth-60">Paper to shroud my swaddling</div>
<div class="depth-60">I am not</div>
<div class="depth-60">Crying</div>
<div class="depth-60">Who is this person</div>
<div class="depth-60">This was all a test</div>
<div class="depth-60">Or a reminder</div>
<div class="depth-60">Or a semaphore or the return</div>
<div class="depth-60">The reel reversed</div>
<div class="depth-60">Lykke li plays</div>
<div class="depth-60">Forward this time. Forward</div>
<div class="depth-60">And to my right after I perform a small ritual</div>
<div class="depth-60">(Hidden, miniature version of the grandeur I placed at my altar)</div>
<div class="depth-60">I see a birdcage</div>
<div class="depth-60">Like the one never hung up in place as promised by Bear</div>
<div class="depth-60">That’s been sitting on my kitchen floor that I finally swept for the first time in maybe three months</div>
<div class="depth-60">Dancing</div>
<div class="depth-60">Kneeling and dancing</div>
<div class="depth-60">To the washing machine drum</div>
<div class="depth-60">Beating in rhythm with my heart and the machine</div>
<div class="depth-60">Learnt from aeons of nightmares and engineer dreams</div>
<div class="depth-60">Outside there are two large red</div>
<div class="depth-60">rings,  not quite aligned, but opposite</div>
<div class="depth-60">Not quite meeting, but next to one another</div>
<div class="depth-60">Is this parallel</div>
<div class="depth-60"></div>
<div class="depth-60">Am I seeing patterns where no body asked me</div>
<div class="depth-60">Delusion of reference - Hindsight</div>
<div class="depth-60">Am I being called by a silence</div>
<div class="depth-60">Murid leaves and I think about what to drink</div>
<div class="depth-60">I see the shelves and on the top right is a bottle</div>
<div class="depth-60">Named chAos</div>
<div class="depth-60">With the A outlined, again, screaming at me</div>
<div class="depth-60">George with a frog tattoo saying queer people always ask about the frog first and non-queers ask about what drink he’s sitting in</div>

<div class="depth-60">Top of the hill now, the latest I’ve been climbing</div>
<div class="depth-60">I thought I saw someone on the right of me</div>
<div class="depth-60">I thought there was somebody</div>
<div class="depth-60">Walking beside me</div>
<div class="depth-60">But no</div>
<div class="depth-60">At least not if any corporeal form</div>
<div class="depth-60">As the song now playing says</div>

<div class="depth-60">I fucking</div>
<div class="depth-60">Miss it</div>
<div class="depth-60">Not it</div>
<div class="depth-60">But the part that you held in it</div>
<div class="depth-60">And the part I just</div>
<div class="depth-60">Tried but just</div>
<div class="depth-60">Never could fit</div>
<div class="depth-60">And I feel myself slipping as I type this so I step forward and move my body and try</div>
<div class="depth-60">To remember</div>
<div class="depth-60">This pain is a pleasure</div>
<div class="depth-60">This pain to be felt is a tape is a measure</div>
<div class="depth-60">And I’m winding into something bigger</div>
<div class="depth-60">I’m winding around</div>
<div class="depth-60">Growing up into cycles</div>
<div class="depth-60">But reel and</div>
<div class="depth-60"> much thinner</div>
<div class="depth-60">And there, as I simmer</div>
<div class="depth-60">as the light starts to feel dimmer</div>

<div class="depth-60">In the place of your face that was so achingly absent</div>
<div class="depth-60">So pretty , I remember that shimmer of back-shone kitchen light</div>
<div class="depth-60">I spent so many nights in that kitchen</div>
<div class="depth-60">With {REDACTED} mostly</div>

<div class="depth-60">What a farce</div>

<div class="depth-60">So scary at times</div>
<div class="depth-60">And so handsome</div>
<div class="depth-60">And there I see her</div>
<div class="depth-60">And make a joke about complaining about the service</div>
<div class="depth-60">And she turns around and I see maybe the first friendly face that I could be sure of I’ve seen in over a month</div>
<div class="depth-60">And I throw up my arm in that same angel gesture</div>
<div class="depth-60">And my height and my size being too much for the ceiling I hit the red</div>
<div class="depth-60">lamp which is not quite spherical but warped into an almost-ring</div>

<div class="depth-60">And my heart it is singing</div>
<div class="depth-60">And my harp string is ringing</div>
<div class="depth-60">I know for some reason</div>
<div class="depth-60">And then I look to my left</div>

<div class="depth-60">His surname:</div>
<div class="depth-60">Ward]</div>
<div class="depth-60">Yesterday was almost more dreamlike than the story I just apparently woke from</div>
<div class="depth-60">I walked through a path I’d never seen before I needed the darkness of containment of the absence of light to show me the way</div>
<div class="depth-60">I walked through a gap in the trees and thought of Fae mythology I held out my right hand as my left tried to record with a camera in case through device like a celestial telegram telling me to</div>
<div class="depth-60">Stop</div>
<div class="depth-60">Start</div>
<div class="depth-60">My life and my art are becoming One</div>
<div class="depth-60">Or</div>
<div class="depth-60">They always were</div>
<div class="depth-60">This work is spilling out into reel life like the pipe that has burst with the furling of the Sun</div>
<div class="depth-60">Anyway coming back from this fine-and-welcome interruption to my dancing round my alter (which, by the way is a wooden double-levelled table shaped in a Hexagon - Six Times Two, The Twelve scaffolded in supporting opposition)</div>
<div class="depth-60">I am drinking coffee now but then, when I was at the time of writing a few lines back I was pouring coffee while drinking a derivative of opium - codeine and paracetamol - derived from poppies, and the laboratory</div>
<div class="depth-60">Pouring into my future-emptied cup as I drank from one</div>
<div class="depth-60">At the time I had not given thought to The Star’s tarot symbol</div>
<div class="depth-60">And to my left the drum~ the drum! The washing machine drum,</div>
<div class="depth-60">Still closed</div>
<div class="depth-60">I’d not taken the clothes out in time, like I’d planned to have done</div>
<div class="depth-60">I grin like a madwoman</div>
<div class="depth-60">So at peace with my plans of bettering crumbling</div>
<div class="depth-60">But, centring my resolve to bring my body and my soul into some semblance of greater balance (as I’m cradled by my looping thoughts of Goethe and of Newton, imagining a scene where they’re waltzing in a ballroom alone)</div>
<div class="depth-60">And I try to open the not-quite full binbag of trash collected just before leaving for the hospital in London</div>
<div class="depth-60">And accidentally (yeah, right, I know better know, or worse somehow, I just can’t stop keep writing all this poetry for the half-heard and not looked for generation that’s to come)</div>
<div class="depth-60">I rip the opening too wide, splitting</div>
<div class="depth-60">And I aloud say “oops” and laugh, unwitting</div>
<div class="depth-60">Covering it in the swaddle plastic cloth of a branded black and new one</div>
<div class="depth-60">Witch</div>
<div class="depth-60">By light of whitest magick</div>
<div class="depth-60">*as is everything, all the wrongs and Rites that I have ever and by the time this all is writ I will have done</div>
<div class="depth-60">It’s my last one</div>
<div class="depth-60">My life has been a symphony of energy tight-laddered-broken rung potentials justly aching, begging all the time to be sung, be sung, be sung</div>
<div class="depth-60">And then the undulation of a single finch alters me to another (maybe just the same) grey gull</div>
<div class="depth-60">Now facing away, with a magpie on the eright</div>
<div class="depth-60">Probably the same little guy that welcomed me in the ending of last night</div>
<div class="depth-60">To land, once more atop the angel poised and ready to take flight in reaching, reaching, reaching</div>
<div class="depth-60">I go to do my superstitious salute and realise both the gull and magpie they are gone</div>
<div class="depth-60">_The shroud, the pipe, the organ - they need holes, they need cracks to let the laying eggs of waste out, or at least someone in_</div>
<div class="depth-60">_The trumpets of drosophila herald change that is a steady shore of lore that’s sure to come_</div>
<div class="depth-60">As Phil sings about symbols recurring throughout his life and building his own mythology, and I think of him, and them, and me, and Jung</div>
<div class="depth-60">He sings into both of my ears, caressing them:</div>
<div class="depth-60">_Myths come true_</div>
<div class="depth-60">I get a phone call, the line is unheard, unhearable</div>
<div class="depth-60">But in the distance in the cold and lower altitude outside I can hear the semblance of the voice I’d heard before and I crane my painful neck down from the window, he can hear me but not me hymn, it seems</div>
<div class="depth-60">I laugh as he performs some form of sign language telling me to turn the faucet on</div>
<div class="depth-60">I obey, and open my window just a crack to cold air, and behind a cloud, the Sun</div>
<div class="depth-60">Pausing Phil I hear the good news (small, for me, but not for someone)</div>
<div class="depth-60">He can see he’s been given the wrong location</div>
<div class="depth-60">It is in truth my neighbour who has the plumbing problem</div>
<div class="depth-60">I shout through the crack to the creek of that verbose and loose artery running down from the window</div>
<div class="depth-60">Arnas texts to say she can’t quite make the visit to the Forest today but would I like to see a waterfall near her house instead and I sent her this draft but without this line because I wrot ethics after Ward had told me the small good news</div>
<div class="depth-60">In the dream one of the psychiatrists from the hospital was dressed as a champagne bottle (since Halloween but still was)</div>
<div class="depth-60">Someone tried to ask her quite nicely about it and she started to cry as if this ridiculous costume was in dedication to someone lost</div>
<div class="depth-60">In the waking world I drink a shot of ginger</div>
<div class="depth-60">Like the ones you and {REDACTED} had made for yourselves</div>
<div class="depth-60">And chase it with the juice of an apple now regarding the wind chime which I fixed and placed in a new, ,backward facing position,</div>
<div class="depth-60">The white side pointing inward, black side outward, seems to say “look out into the light”</div>
<div class="depth-60">So I do, and see that much-before seen sight</div>
<div class="depth-60">The blackened, singed and burned automotive repair shop which once had housed the greatest and most roaring fire my eyes had ever gazed upon</div>
<div class="depth-60">In fear and such ancient reverence</div>
<div class="depth-60">The Ashen shroud covered the word DEB’S which was the name of one of the cafeteria workers who remembered my name and always injected a smile onto my face in moonful sunshine mirror of reflection</div>
<div class="depth-60">And to the right, another place, called A. GRAY</div>
<div class="depth-60">My ‘E’ key is stuck again</div>
<div class="depth-60">Out of the washing machin drum I pull my pair of bought for myslf burgundy pyjamas as if knowing I was haded for a rstful dstination</div>
<div class="depth-60">And out comes an auxiliary cable, umbilical, resembling (and I think it’s the same at first) one of those red</div>
<div class="depth-60">elastic strings I’d come across in the woods in the clearing next to the 10mph sign which was the distant view of writing most of this story although by the time it’s done I know it will represent just an infinitesimal fraction of this magnum of my odyssey of insanity and ancestral reclamation </div>
<div class="depth-60">And then I pull out the red</div>
<div class="depth-60">robe entangled with countless pairs of fishnets and black tights and Jesus Christ this is all too much poetry for me to try to contain I really must get these menial tasks done and come down to life that must just be dust particles floating in a long lost son</div>
<div class="depth-60">I put in the second load, the last</div>
<div class="depth-60">From the soil of load I’d carried back</div>
<div class="depth-60">And then I see Tofu, Isla</div>
<div class="depth-60">Oh Islands of my Becoming</div>
<div class="depth-60">I’d done you so wrong in our connection</div>
<div class="depth-60">A google drive collaborative journal I can’t bring myself to open</div>
<div class="depth-60">I’d become my Welsh-inherited ex-partners reflection and that was a daffodil I could not bear to be hunted by or look upon</div>
<div class="depth-60">Any longer  of a life together and I’d have died</div>
<div class="depth-60">I start the whirring of the drum</div>
<div class="depth-60">On setting ‘2’ now and remember how you’d said it’s okay we can wait I can wait to wash them</div>
<div class="depth-60">Your treasured childhood possession</div>
<div class="depth-60">I wrapped them in a pillowcase, not to hide them but to protect them, Like I had with Colin already</div>
<div class="depth-60">I think about your allergies and all the smoke that I’d thoughtlessly blown about the room that Tofu placed gently on a shelf I couldn’t handle their presence in my bed any longer and in my reckless wrecked and wretched wrung with no-wrung-or-wing out of that place I</div>
<div class="depth-60">Thought that your wanting space was the same as the one I shouldn’t have ever named</div>
<div class="depth-60">I thought you needed physical space from me in bed for the repulsion at my skin but it was your own skin’s repulsion at the chemicals I contained within or hadn’t washed off in my</div>
<div class="depth-60">Mania</div>
<div class="depth-60">You used to call me Maniac</div>
<div class="depth-60">With such love</div>
<div class="depth-60">As I pulled out glass from my feet from that night’s performance where I’d accidentally or perhaps on purpose stepped on a lightbulb and smashed it into my skin while screaming half-contained within a cage that had an accordion bound to the bars which I pushed against gravity and pulled down with it and pulled myself down with it I was naked save for a set of symbols laid upon my deranged and scarred body and containing all the shame of my genitalia within inguinal canals of rivers of rivers of rivers about to be released from me</div>
<div class="depth-60">Containment - expansion - expression - retention - vertical stake holding place of horizon - god - do these cycles ever end?</div>
<div class="depth-60">A stone woman gives birth to a child at night</div>
<div class="depth-60">When I’d dream</div>
<div class="depth-60">There was a dog</div>
<div class="depth-60">A few dogs</div>
<div class="depth-60">One of whom knew how to turn the lights on and off</div>
<div class="depth-60">Chinaski - the name of a writers alter ego</div>
<div class="depth-60">Sin, Sine</div>
<div class="depth-60">Have I written about the bat I saw above the pond of bodies yet?</div>
<div class="depth-60">I really must not forget to include that most divine encounter</div>
<div class="depth-60">I whispered to him</div>
<div class="depth-60">And then catching myself I just spoke at my normal all-surrounding resonance of din</div>
<div class="depth-60">I just want to say something true</div>
<div class="depth-60">I said something true to the bat</div>
<div class="depth-60">As he flapped, blind, but seeing More with his unheard hald-herd clicks than the sight of my own human eyes could have ever knew</div>
<div class="depth-60">Cones for red</div>
<div class="depth-60">, for green, and those for blue</div>
<div class="depth-60">But he just had the click of his tongue and made do</div>
<div class="depth-60">No, surpassed my paths of forking</div>
<div class="depth-60">Tongues</div>
<div class="depth-60">We spoke to one another in tongues</div>
<div class="depth-60">After I’d passed through</div>
<div class="depth-60">That gap of Janus in the blackened hues of maybe oak or Yews</div>
<div class="depth-60">I fall asleep again and think I’ve written way more down than I have, semi-waking to my mouth rambling to my brain</div>
<div class="depth-60">Notification: your payment plan for Scottish Goat Company is resuming</div>

<div class="depth-60">Being pulled to pulling of my cards again while editing this document, El Diablo photograph alerting me to The Devil burned into the box of card on my left side, where peeking like a crow beak from the slit, the rip in the wood is the stalk of that dead but so living leaf I kept from the threshold to the realm of Kali</div>
<div class="depth-60">Lifting up the box underneath is Ramayya’s Sacred Words, States of the Body</div>
<div class="depth-60">I place my right hand upon it and breathe holy air like a criminal about to give testament</div>
<div class="depth-60">I shuffle the cards in my usual way, three times with the deck pointed west, three times south, three times East and three times North makes twelve and then I pull a single card and realise, that’s enough</div>
<div class="depth-60">That’s all I need – Stained with the brown rotted suggestion of rose petals from the grounds of that place that left such holy holes in me</div>
<div class="depth-60">There, my sea</div>

<div class="depth-60">After holding the plate in front of you in gratitude you speak the two words Thank You aloud, addressing No One but the Earth. Which of course, is everyone. You devour both halves, first left, then right. Separately. Bringing them together inside yourself, you are filled.

<div class="depth-60">ý In Typography a ligature is a single glyph or character that is formed by joining two or more letters or graphemes. For example, the characters ⟨æ⟩ and ⟨œ⟩ are ligatures that join the letters ⟨a⟩ and ⟨e⟩, and ⟨o⟩ and ⟨e⟩, respectively. Ligatures are often used in OpenType fonts to improve the appearance of characters that visually collide when used together. In medicine a ligature is a medical procedure that involves using a suture to secure a blood vessel before dividing it. It can also refer to tying string or dental floss around a skin tag to cut off blood circulation.

<div class="depth-60">X The word “consonant” comes from the Latin root consonare, meaning “to sound together” or “to agree.” This root can be broken down further - “Con-”: a Latin prefix meaning “together” or “with.” - “Sonare”: a Latin verb meaning “to sound.” Originally, consonare referred to sounds that were “sounding together,” signifying harmony or agreement. This idea of sounding together is foundational to both meanings of consonant:</div>
<div class="depth-60">Consonance in Sound (Linguistic): Consonants, in a linguistic sense, “sound together” with vowels to form syllables and words. Unlike vowels, which can be voiced alone, consonants typically need to be paired with a vowel to be fully articulated. In this sense, they are in “agreement” or “harmony” with vowels, creating the building blocks of words.</div>
<div class="depth-60">Consonance in Agreement (Abstract): The concept of things being in agreement or harmonious extends from this “sounding together” notion. Just as consonants need to work with vowels in language, people or ideas that are in “consonance” are in harmony, aligning or “sounding together” metaphorically.</div>
<div class="depth-60">Thus, the Y-branchY connecting these meanings lies in the concept of harmonious sound or agreement, whether literal (in linguistic sounds) or figurative (in aligned ideas). The Latin origin is where the concept diverges into its linguistic use (as a type of letter) and its abstract use (as being in agreement), each stemming from the foundational idea of “sounding together.”</div>
<div class="depth-60">Y Y itself is a branch-letter hybrid that’s neither vowel nor consonant, the first nor the second, but in penultimacy, semi-animacy, half-heard but half-breathed, between two waves which have been separated - X and Z</div>

They were previously placed in a separate superfamily, Hesperioidea; however, the most recent taxonomy places the family in the superfamily Papilionoidea, the butterflies. They are named for their quick, darting flight habits. Much like a finch, sparrow, witch His/Her Eye Is On. Most have their antenna tips modified into narrow unbaited hooks of projections.
