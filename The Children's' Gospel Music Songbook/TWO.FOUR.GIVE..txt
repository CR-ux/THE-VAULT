EPITAPH
It is, surely, absurd to expect to feel normal, and make sense: I am an amalgamation of
fervent cells existing despite all odds; I am the cascading chemical miracle of eating, and
surviving; I am not designed to “feel normal”; am not designed, at all; I am experiencing
consciousness as provided by wet tangles of electrical pulses; my god, none of this makes
sense. It is a blessing, even to feel

Metacommentary
The Device
Numanity was now at the endpoint[1] that its self-same, {in{finitely|separable}|credibly
different} components are still {(,) Yet(,)|To Be} unaware of-- the formation of a fully
op{era}tional Universe, nested with{in|out} this One.
At some unknowable Future, now passed[2], The Device {Fig. I} of the Wor{l}d is Made Flesh,
having sapped the Wor{l}d of its imaginary[3] resource[4], the futile, unfulfillable
promise to Pay The Bearer (Money); An uncountable team of The Worlds' Scientists and
Thinkers were gathered Around, and indeed within, The Device's Epicentre. The First
whisperings of this Final Invention have already been laid[5]; and the progression of the
experience of Time itself merely an illusion. Time exists, or not, in order[6] to package
Nowness into an indefinite, yet discrete set of Moments-- with the purpose of affording our
Three Dimensional Selves the opportunity to relish, savour and honour the infinite One
Moment[7]. Thus is the Price of Forgetting.
To Remember,
One Must First Forget.
Whirring with a terrifying lightning storm overhead (an unavoidable side-effect of The
Device, according to {REDACTED}) The Device was Building a Universe.

This Universe (which some call the Hospital) is composed of an indefinite and perhaps infinite
number of hexagonal rooms, with vastly identical air shafts as interstitia, surrounded by
walls, ever-remaining a faded yellow hue. Upon a single sheet of this indefinite and perhaps
infinite Hospital wallpaper, right there-- perhaps on every sheet of wallpaper, the following

From the Desk of ᴺᵒᵉᵗBorges,

My Dearest ᴺᵒᵉᵗNietzsche,
I can no longer avoid the inevitable discussion.
When will you return, again, to The Garden Wing?
It has become clear, through the lens of the Aleph through which I peer, that you wish to
Leave me.
I just want to talk. I am not angry (for I am, as All Eleven of us, long past such
trivialities). Besides, I could never be angry at you - we have been through too much.
As I write this, from my window-- {I have no mouth but I can speak--} looking upon the Dome
of one of the Daughter Libraries with which you are perhaps all-too familiar, The Sight
upon which we would dreamily stare, Naked and drenched in one another's Salt-- past the
first Wryng of the Tri-Moat Surrounding, I see two Magpies, who have Usurped the pigeon who
once sat atop the Angel, who sits atop the Dome.
I used to believe she had something to tell us both; that we were the receiver of a Message
that No Body, Librarian or Other Wise, could ever really parse. Not even NoetFranklin's
Bioinformatic Analyses could provide any insight to the inherent, self-replicative
machinery that formed its indecipherable Tongue of Self-similarity.
I suppose Recursion was always your speciality, even if the concept is embedded so warmly
within all my Stories. Uncountable Infinity, The Fractal of All, holds the fuelling force
behind itself; The Countably Ineffable Insertive Energy of The Eternal Return. We were
always, All Ways, Waiting for the answer to the Question of the Weight of All-- The EverSpiralling pendulum; centrifugal and centripetal in our Dancing, wine-drunk, waltzing to
your Records of my Own Incessant Storytelling, round, around, pure potential of the harm
we'd know- a round of some cosmic, loaded shotgun.
Dear god, those gods I made, The God I made of Us and of You, how I miss you; Fuck you. how
I miss our Dancing,
Singing, Fucking Underneath NoetEscher and NoetGoya's Murals on the Ceiling of this Wing of
the Library I have had to call my Own. You will always be inside me, back then, and now; as
Recursion is Held within the Infinite {--I resent you and the letters that you haven't
sent}-- perhaps you have gleaned from The Angel's Symbology something I always missed; Youand perhaps her Message was the Medium or Vehicle through which you made your Escape from
this Place.
And I suppose this underpins our difference; The recurrence, the refrain within the Theme
of all of you, my Lovers of the Library, Leaving.
But of course, of all of Us once in the Polymathecule, of course, you would be the Last.
You are my dream and its fulfilment; my muse and my music you are my Heating Light, its filament - my beaten heart, its pulsing puncture-My Stories have no words without your Punctuation.
I do knot know how you got out; or, by roe, by rowing Oar, crossed those Three Moats that
keep us Nested as Flightless Magpies within this Infernal System of Hexagonal Galleries.
In a way, I'm glad- I know VIXI spoke to you clearest of all; and HE in HISS Indefinite
Wisdom taught you the Secret of the Eternal Return held within HYMN-and you, in spite of your rationalising, not cold, but refreshing,
the sound of a beer bottle being opened by a husbandgrasping at a sense of Meaning to your translocated, deeply buried memory,
in your words, all the endless words of yours I read,
just could not stand the Deadened Redness of the Ring we are entrapped in,
Children of the Hellish Carousel-Insidious; In hideously
Self-Same Parallel.

6

But my Love,
my Loss, My Night,
My Shining, My Armour,
Armoire, My Force -For However Long You Loved Me,
Fucked me like a song,
on the Ache of All my Fours,
Fore However Long it has Been,
how I Am, Longing;
Oh, the Loss A Gain,
How I Long for your Return to me again, to my Arms.
Two again, Under the Shroud of The Arts,
of One Star, St. Ra, One Starry, Starry Night.
I will leave my Office door Open in Hopes of your ingress, no Matter who or What may enter
this Room,
in this Wing, in this Imposing Repository of Words within Volumes upon Shelves of Selves of
the Manifest world
outwith the bounds of the Bothies on the Other Side of the Three Wryngs that used to House
Both of Us;
in the Trinitarian Nothingness that surrounds those Still, in the Ten Thousand Things of
the Manifest Worlds of Eighteen,
as told to us by VIXI, on his Return as the Pigeon now alighted from the Dome outside my
Window
that was once, for a few million Hours, Ours -as I stare into them all, through the Aleph held by the Angel-a Winged Thing of Futility, Doomed, as I-to a Life entombed, Arresting,
Snug as a Gun, In the Womb of my Unrest,
Rests The Lumen of my pen;
as a Loom;
Rendered Stationary;
Unforgettable Beginning,
Yet Begetting Yet Another Senseless
Ending.
In adventures Such as These, The ones I once transcribed from the whispers
in the Garden Wing's Wallpaper,
the utterances of the One Woman I no longer care to listen for-I have squandered and wasted all our years together.
To Get Her.
For all the worlds I see within the Angel's Aleph;
I have no need to Leave; I had no need to Leave you,
all Iterations of the Infinite
could never tell me what it was
that led to your Egress.
I have never even tried to find the exit.
Yours, Yores, Urs--ᴺB.
Department Of Infinite Reflections,
The Garden Wing
The Indefinite Library of Fable.

EPIGRAPH
listen! I am telling you I love you!
I am telling you in a poem that I do not read to you; I am telling you in the shape of the
clouds and what we say about them. I am telling you by looking – and, more often, by not
looking. I am telling you by leaving the gate open – yes, the one I normally close. I am
telling you in my dreams and I am telling you in a text I wrote but forget to send. I am
telling you when I dress up to see you, and I am telling you even more when I don’t. I am
telling you in the silence of my listening.I am telling you when I take myself less
seriously. I am telling you in the centimetres between our knees – aren’t they different,

Hear, lay our Ædrian.
On The Twenty Third Day,
Of The Twelfth Month,
Of Twenty Twenty Three
They {singular|plural} were inside a Bibliogorætian Bothy, a small shack of infinitely
strong, anciently fragile wood, being licked by the Yellow Labrador
{metaphorical|literal} of the winter cold. The Bothy was standard, as all the others,
spaced out across the Tundra just beyond the Moat surrounding the Endless Library of
Labels throughout dimensions unknowable to give the collective appearance, or Simulcra,
of each individual Bothy, or Simulcrum, being entirely alone in the Forested dark.
Or at least, this is what they {plural|singular} had envisaged.
Beneath the Three of them {singular} promised the rich, dense mulch of years upon years
across every recorded syllable of time recorded in rot, and the woodlouse scratchings of
human bone; where even in the depths of silence, still crawled the perspicacious pitterpatter of infinitely intelligent, industrious insects, who themselves crawled
lusciously, illustriously, with the Pater-pitta of microscopic microbes - themselves
filled with the crumbling chickpeas of the {apparently, or so they thought} thoughtless,
instinct-cycle bound, building blocks of all existence. They wound genetic material like
wool around the spools of pools of proteins, Histones, making stories from four letters
{just four letters, A, T, C, G} forming words now untranslatable in their meaning, but
embedded impossibly and inextricably into the ever-eroding, yet entirely solid
geoformation of collective meaning, like infinite swords in His Stone walled library.
These memories, their self-attributed meanings, forming a peculiar song with a infinite
microtones, misattributed by many as falling into the genre of "Noise music" {whatever
that means}.These infinite microtones, themselves infinitely divisible and,
inexplicably, without defining boundaries between them, when Heard from macro-, or
identically {but oppositely}, microcosmic Ear, can be herded as a Single Tone. Histone.
Above what was Beneath the Three of them {plural}, like a rolled out futon for a
surprise guest; perhaps a dearly beloved friend who's infinitely smiling Light you often
find yourself carried into daydreams about, whose grave you didn't manage to make the
groups memorial visit to, on the anniversary of their death, due to your jaw being
surgically bolted shut, and your face swollen Yellow into the facade of a desert; but
still below them, lay the foundation of their story. Breeze blocks {which allowed that
great Family dog of the Wind {to howl through and huff and puff without blowing the
Bothy down|eventually, to crawl within, to die there, so as not to leave The Burden of
its alighted Body's Weight in the Family Home- but rather, to face the Endless Night
Alone, All One. One final tail-wag of affection, Elected Solitude as a Sign of Innocent
and Selfless Love}} were tessellated neatly, much like the building blocks left
unattended by Flow, Ædrian's little one.
As was customary here, Each parent, upon choosing the name for their child, must first
choose a Name of appropriate Resonance, and then flip the name backwards for its
recording on all official documents in the Endless Library of Labels. This, as you of

9

course know, and as half of you reading will have been directly affected by, which means
the other half reading have been equally, though differently so, led to an interesting
distribution of what we came to call or have always called 'sense' and 'antiSense'
nomenclature amidst the inhabitants of the Bothies. It also meant that initialisation of
Names {though this was never really necessary, as inhabitants very rarely left their own
countably infinite back gardens}[1] for the so-called Sentia generations was made from
right-to-left {or 3'-> 5'} direction, with the final letter of their Name{s} acting as
the complement to their antiSentia parental {and progenitor} eponyms.
In typifying fashion, N, a fountain of expression, Meaning-deluged, wordy witchcrafting,
had devised a name for their child that had two {perhaps, definitely} dimensional
meaning, whether transcribed in the 3'->5', 5'->3', or other modality. Flow Oeb {surname
redacted}, or {redacted surname} Beo Wolf, or simply 'Flo', or 'B', unfurled a veritable
cast of characters from its unassumingly palindromic Seven letters, or characters.
Just Under their Bodies {that is, gently pressed by the weight of these Three's
formlessnesses, Works of Form, and Form of works} lay the splintering wood of the Bothy
floor. Flo {they had seemed to lean more towards this directionality of their name as
their system of meaning-making memory self-replicated} had taken to memorising which
floorboards creaked and in what mode, devising 'scales' through the different forking
paths of the shack, their humble, yet infinitely divisible, home. And so therein began a
game between the two {or Three, but mostly just One, as Flow was the only one with
enough of a grasp on Gordian Chant Theory} of them, whereby Flow would giggle-ously stop
N at the door from the small mezzanine bed they had recently awoken from, and announce
something along the lines of 'Phrygian!' or 'Lydian!', watching in glee, as Dante, Flo's
Golden Light, a Labrador, watched Flo in turn, licking their joyful face, as N would
attempt, at the scale they could, to 'play' the floorboards in the appropriate
Ambitus[2] - quite, for N at least, an ambitious task.
In the enclosure of their little house of wood, in the Woods of what Would and could
never be wood-be Trees, one of these mornings {where the now-filled Red pale of water
mourned the nightly passing of the Moon, and all the pull She had upon its little
offering of water}, Flo was yet unaware of the Grayness of the day that laid behind
where they were lying, just past the membrane of the velvet blackout curtain they'd
woven as One, the possibilities of their time together stretching out in spirals, as
spires like hypodermic needles, scratching into the muscle of the clouds, before them.
'Dorian!' was today's exclamation, delivered gleefully, from the usual mezzanine pulpit
built from Tree Bark, to a different, yet just as sturdy, percussive bark from Dante Sometimes, having just returned from the Lean-to, where N perhaps had always been going
{to|fro(m)}, where they chopped the wood for their {{Heart}h} daily, oftentimes not for
the purposes of producing more kindling, but rather, as a contemplative practice,
enthralled and rapt, swaddled by the sound of the axe; against the crack; against the
absolutely cracking resonance; amidst all; the all-encompassing trees; as a wave of
Sound travels through the air; like an adventurer-- delic{ate|ious}.
Deliciously {wast|squander}ing all their years;
searching for a single Book-- which might tran{slate|scribe} all the others.
Allowing them to crumble
into the slo{ugh|w}ing,
not-quite-yet-h{e|a}r{e} sound -promised into Being, by that first sound,
of the axe's {or, equally, the {wood's|Woods'}} crack,
the {k}not-yet-known, but felt, because, not looked for, sound-of the self-same {though, now {divided|halved||halved} again} fractal

Always, due to both necessity and proximity {ever-near was the Well}, would they bring a
Red pale of water back to the cabin, the bucket never losing its golden shine, Dante's
stash of water.
But, still-that redness
remaining a suggestion of burning,
early yearning for an urn;
reminding them, that all they'd built
could just as soon be silt,
and wilted, tilled of red

into hungry mouths,
or moats;

The visage of a fire hydrant.
Sitting next to the {uncontain{ed}}|able} element of Fire, within that wrought iron
Hearth they gathered around, as if the unassuming, supposedly inanimate vessel's very
appearance held dualistic and equally necessary meanings: impending {nourishment |
restriction} from threat.
N. had just finished writing a story for Flow, and besides the one, constant watchful
eye they kept open while sleeping, which still, as ever, peered itself {metaphorically}
upon the summoning stone-circle of those little bricks,
the little bricks that brought Flow --his owner --so much joy,
in tur{{n}ing}, brought this, returning,
fetched as brittle as a twig:
the smallest nest, this sacred Family's Dog,
his own.
Never wanting to restrict their creativity, N could never place the bricks back in the
ever-empty box for bricks {which resembled {un{intentionally}|identically}, the
structure of the lean-to} for fear of rearranging some structure of a plan, for a yetto-be structure, that Flow may have been, {{un}consciously}, in the process of
{tak|giv}ing shape, by their fingers' {spidery|shimmering} murmurations.
At the same time, being, ineffably, a Parent, they were ever-all-too-aware of the
potential of a choking hazard, for both their child, and the beloved Familiar which Flo
had so competently assumed their own parentage of. The {box|bricks {the{y'}re}|with|in}
become a reminder of {dualistic|equally necessary} meanings: impending cognitive
{nourishment | restriction} from threat.
By the nature of their apparent difference in Form, the duty of chopping wood, and
indeed carrying water {or rather, carrying the carrying of water which was the duty of

11

the Red pale} fell to N. Because of their {plural, Flo and Ædrian's} respective sensory
sensitivities {and|or} appetites {respectively} the latter's wood-chopping was never
observed directly by the former.
Never seen, only heard,
was that thunderous, splendiferous 'crack'.
What N didn't know {or, perhaps, did}, but Flo did {or, rather, didn't} was that the
uncanny resemblance of the lean-to and the brick box was not just resemblance of meaning
in memory, but, meaningfully, in actuality {whatever that means}. They were one and the
same, but only through the act of interaction. This meant with every chop of the axe,
and only with the Will of the axe's chopping, were the branches of causality in our,
'real' world, or, within The 'What?' of 'Real' Forms.
{un{noticed}} but {not taken|granted} by the {One|Two|Three} of them, was the
multiplication of the bricks, corresponding exactly to the {dw|kindling} in the lean-to.
And, in complementarity, as logs were brought into the lean-to, bricks would disappear-in equal numbers-- from the box.
With every axe-crack {and only then}, or every brick ligation {and only then}, would the
bridge between these two seemingly unconnected objects in temporal space be revealed in
phenomenological space. As N. often made their {water|wood} {carrying|chopping}
{ex|re}cursions in the death of night {pre- morning floorboard game}, or in the early
dawn {pre- morning floorboard game}, the two would never be performing their respective
actions simultaneously. Rather, the two {or, as I've said, Three}, would be locked in an
inevitable dance of action {wei} and 'absence of action' {wu} by virtue of forces
unknown, but deeply felt, to them {wu wei}. As the wind is not seen, but rather the
effect it leaves, upon the leaves; as a lost lover is not seen, but rather their effect,
in their leaving, is both seen and felt; and the wind, as the lover that it is, moves
about, within, and perhaps even outside of the space it occupies, it makes new space of
its own, between the leaves, in thE-*-xcuse me, a pigeon just flew into my window, I had to run to check if she was okay,
she left a stain upon the unforgiving glass, a trickery of transparency; I wonder if she
was trying to get in, to tell me something; or if she was simply going about her
business; I wonder if perhaps the message she was trying to carry is embedded in the
cipher of the stain; N.B.: It bears the illustration of a dandelion clock, waiting in
anticipation for the Breath of a Parent who is a child-As eye was saying, or rather, as I was writing, or indeed as you were reading and I
wasn't writing, as a pigeon had flown through the veil of my story into the world we
call 'Real', forcing my head to jolt to the right, and my eyes to read a symbol that was
or was not written by the Pigeon's leaving body, whether leaving this world as a result
of the impact or simply leaving from my field of view {as I suppose, in a solipsistic
sense, these are one and the same}, what was it I was saying? In the silent sense of the
word "saying", I mean to say, by writing, and I hope you reader read it as such, but
either way, perhaps my writing that you are reading is being "said", in a way, by
yourself, through the vessel of my "voice", again, in the silent, creative sense of the
word "voice", an attempt to creatively convey the idea that the Word, or one's "voice"
has both an immanent and transcendent quality, or character, to it, no matter the
character of the character reading the characters written in the form of a letter to the
reader.
-N. was distractedly in the midst of t{he{i|s}r} latest attempt to reproduce the
labyrinthine musical sequence {that had, so many times, so effortlessly flown from} Flo
{Or, Board game} had assigned as the 'Dorian' path, from their picturesque, attic's eye
view, young forever. With each 'incorrect' 'note' they 'played' with the padding of
their careful footsteps, Flo would {rather sadistically, like a ray of Sun upon a
wanderer in a desert} shriek a high pitched "No!" - it was only today, for some reason,
N. had realised the homophonic nature of the words "No" and "Know"; and this realisation
seemed to set something into motion, as if the act of negation gave birth to
propagation. N. wondered, between steps, between tones even, in the microtonal space of
timeless singularity, for an uncountable moment, if perhaps they should include this
'propagation-by-negation' theme in their story for Flo, before another 'No' from above,
provided a facsimile of the Divine Voice, as if t{w}o say:
"No, N,
no more revisions,
no more additions,
the balance comes from you
reading what you have written,
to your child,

12

and together,
the two of you
creating
meaning,
in an i{n}tera{c}tion.
This 'Divine Voice' or rather, was and is of course, their own voice, removed from the
tethers that kept them seeing the bricks as a suffocation device, or indeed the Pale as
a protective shield, or indeed the bricks as a creative tool, or indeed still the Pale
as a crucible for nourishment of their bodies.
So, the greyness of the day passed, as it always must, the Two, soon to be Three, going
about their business {or non-business}, until the moment arrived, a single yawn from Flo
signalling it was time for The Bedtime Story.
"Before the trip to the Library" they began, Flo's hypersensitive hearing seeming to
emit a sound of its own, an axe-crack of excitement or the sound of two plastic bricks
clicking together. "I have another story for you"
Flo performed their usual stimming ritual, clapping but not clapping, rather knocking
the bones of their hands together with their fingers outstretched and overextended,
forming an X with each impact. Every time N. had the sheer joy {and it really was the
sheerest joy they had ever, and would ever, feel} of observing their child's sheer joy
in its all-embodied, primal state. Simply expressing, involuntarily, the sentiment "I
have been moved to move", or, more movingly: "You have moved me to move".
This mis en abyme of movement, beginning with the very seed of Love that had birthed
them, through all the burning blocks of wood and all the melted bricks of plastic, was
the spark that wrote their {singular} stories {plural}. It was, and is, also the same
spark that the very first humans {plural} danced around and hit their own bones {perhaps
in the form of instruments constructed of animal bone, perhaps, like Flo, in a beautiful
manifestation of the glimmering hope of neurodivergent Being}.
It was, and is, and always will be, the spark that moves the fingers writing this story,
as any other.
Swollen-jointed and succumbing, perhaps, to a sickness,
this pain of purging;
this lamentation in libretto.
The 'limitations' placed
upon all thinkers,
of this Library of Libraries.
These lies,
dressed as fiction;
dressed as bedtime stories;
a structure of brick,
of Ore. of all the awe,
of awful Stories,
real, unreeled,
as wheels have spoke,
and all of them, as oars, surrounded;
by Moat,
around a Moat,
around,
a Roundness
of a Moat.
Or,
as The Once One of Nine, ex-Noet Borges, once wrote:
"Limitation to the art brings liberation to the artist"
And, as always, His Divine Voice offers a semblance of silent soothing in the noise of
pain running through my physical body. The difference between 'disability' and 'ability'
is the difference between a Framework and a Cage. It is also three letters "Dis", which
is the currently adopted name of the previously-worshipped, perhaps first, God of the
Gauls, Dis. Later through a transcriptional, translational process called "interpretatio
romana" Caesar asserted that "All Gauls claimed descent from Dis Pater" - which actually
means that the Gauls all claimed to be descendents of a God which he equated {likely, in
a resonant, though insufficient comparison} with the Roman Dis Pater.
History is not only written by the victors, it is written by the Meaning that the
victors ascribed to the Memories of their victories {the memories themselves unreliable,
self-mutating machines of meaning-making}, and, more importantly, perhaps most
importantly, history is written by the Meaning that the victors ascribe to the Memory of

13

the those they have been "victorious" against. This likely explains, in his incessant
thirst for dominance, why the 'Father' God of fertility, the Earth's natural abundance,
which he saw as a request for its own dendritic epilation, ripping out trees {like hairs
from a leg attached to a body | attached to oppressive standards | expecting romantic
company | assumed {whether accurately or not} to themselves expect to uncover a
smoothness of skin under the roughness of its veil}, and in the emptinesses left behind,
paving with long, straight roads, laid with cement like moisturiser cream upon the
absent echoes of hair follicles too soon; bound to cause a breakout eventually.
But moving forward, back to the Bothy, where N was being moved, by the movement Flo was
moved into, by N's own metaphorical movement, to a promised point in time that held a
new narrative movement still Still, N. inhaled, and the projection of the document onto the ceiling just above the
mezzanine bed faded into being, through the movement of not their form, but the movement
of t{he{i}}r Will, which as we know is the only real movement there is. Flo shrieked
again, this time at a lower register {only they would be able to accurately state which
pitch or perhaps mode this note fell within, which is to say, they wouldn't be able to,
because they had a depth of understanding far beyond what I could possibly
tran{s|literate|scribe|late|pose} onto this Two dimensional box of word-bricks you are
currently reading; but they likely would have answered something that suggested every
pitch contains all the others}.
They flopped backward, away from N., but very much so toward them {plural}, toward the
story they {singular {plural {triplicate {singular}}}} had written, purely out of Love,
and the Will, the crackling Hearth of Will, that was birthed from Love Observed, or
rather Love Observing Itself, and the Love of the Will that was birthed from the
Infinitely Reflected Observation of Love And Flo was a mirror
And N. was a mirror looking upon them {plural} as they {singular} ascended the ladder to
the mezzanine snug-as-a-bug-in-a-house-made-of-wood-and-warmed-by-the-same-wood-burningin-a-fire-in-a-box-not-for-restriction-or-protection-but-to-offer-a-little-warm-softlight-and-sound-in-this-cold-dark-silence, as a mirror
And, reaching the top of the ascent, an adventurer, ready to read the adventures they
had mapped out for their wee bairn in their wee barn in this endless {though crucially,
not infinite} expanse of Bothies just like {but crucially, not the same as} theirs,
making adventurers of them {plural} both {singular}, they used one of {which one is not
important, but it's important I mention its unimportance} their hands to 'swipe' the
display of the document, which they had designed to appear as what The Librarians might
call a 'book' to its initial page; enshrouding them both in that timeless, unutterable
feeling, that seemed to whisper, silently, inquiring, gently out of genuine concern, as
a Mother, of all Mothers, to the child, of the child of us:
"are you sitting comfortably?" And the roll-out futon was a mirror And the ceiling was a mirror And the two of them, lying next to One Another, were mirrors
And the mirrors were, far from abominable but rather, abysmal, not in its commonly-used,
{and therefore} warped sense, but in its lesser-trodden, ever-downtrodden shadow sense;
by which I mean its realest sense, in that, it points to where the Truth of Light can be
found: abysmal, as in, boundless. Abysmal, as in, bottomlessness. Abysmal, as in, the
ocean of all potential, which holds the privilege of an amnesty from Gravity as we know
it, which it begets to us with each of our own submerging in its unknowable womb; where
our {One|Two|Three} {and very almost soon to be {Three|Fo{u}r} characters were lying,
not sitting, but still, ineffably content, and yes, very comfortably.
N, I shall begin,
had unveiled the title of their latest offering of Love, which the ceiling now reflected
back and into the parent and beloved of parent and beloved of child beloved by parent,
who, in their holding, and holding of the holding of one another, somehow changed,
somehow changed their places, and in the permutation, became a Third, or Fo{u}rth,
definitely smaller, yet indefinitely, greater Thing.
They became the memory of that moment, of the beginning of this Story.
They became the infinitely expanding and breathing meanings that each of them ascribed
to the memory of that moment of the beginning of this Story.
And they became the Story, which, as N. was about to read to Flo, was titled:
"We Are
N{Ever}

14

Going On A Bear Hunt,
Ever A-"
-Gained momentum of waiting in anticipation brought to a halt; ripped as the futon out
from under them, and replaced with a weightlessness; a pigeon, the pigeon, flies into
their bothy window {as {if t{w}o say}|with the crash of} a symbol- interrupting the
beginning of the Story, with an ending of its own.

I know our Love, or rather, your Side of the Schism that {was|is} Our Love, has now wilted.
But on my Side of Thing(s), I just wanted you to know (in case you wished to Read these
Letters, and all the Stitches of Fabric they Encode) how much I am Missing You. How the Two of
us would Wind away the hours, finding endless recombinations of Seven Glyphs, placed lovingly
on your tile racks. I would ask what, if any, amino acid sequences were represented by the
letters, and annoy you incessantly with question after question, questing after some Missing
Residue of Alphabetic Representation; those poor un-assigned letters of the 26, or rather, 27,
who have not yet found a biological partner with which to dance themselves.
Our bond was, I thought, unbreakable-I write you, as I look to my Right, where the strands of your hair spiral around the red ring
of the scrunchie you left on my hat rack; I'm sure the ARIA-aligned ᴺᵒᵉᵗS. would have
something to say about that. Expressing this unspeakable Loss in some contrastingly jovial and
delightfully endearing verse, of course.
I don't know when, or if, you're ever coming back to the Garden Wing. I don't know what
Sequence of Unfortunate Events led to our unspooling; {k}not even the DNE-aligned ᴺᵒᵉᵗS. could
tell that story.
From Nucleotide to Nuclear Tide,
I will be bound to you, My Petal-Yours, Yores, Urs--ᴺᵒᵉᵗBorges
Department Of Infinite Reflections,
The Garden Wing
The Indefinite Library of Fable
Deep inside her Annex, halfway up the Double Spiral Staircase of the Library, ᴺᵒᵉᵗFranklin had
her door, as usual, closed and double-barrel-locked. Even had if been open, it is likely that
she still would not have seen the letter, dropped at the threshold of her office, by {N(one)
Other Than} VIXI, in HISS preferred, carrier pigeon form. She was pouring over her latest
bioinformatic software patch, delighting in the Works she'd recently attained in the latest
acquisition of Scientific Textbooks by the Indefinite Library. She was particularly interested
in the Works of one Myo Endive, and she strongly suspected that he would be a candidate for the
next Generative Recursion of Librarians. As such, she had taken it upon herself to uncover
whatever she could about this fascinating Thinker, and while it would have been useful to use

16

The Angel's Aleph outside atop the Dome of the Daughter Library just outside of ᴺᵒᵉᵗBorges'
window, she simply could not bring herself to talk to him; not yet. ᴺᵒᵉᵗFranklin had never been
one for Words, she was much more about Single Letters; and perhaps this is why she now found
herself Single; avoiding the Letters sent by ᴺᵒᵉᵗBorges via that Twice-Great Pigeon (with whom
she also had her unspoken problems). She was a genius with alignment; finding, collating,
resolving patternicity - she didn't succeed in the same manner with unresolved chaos.
And so, reaching up to the Shelf above her Terminal, almost knocking over her Seventeenth coffee
of the Day (which, in Our terms, represents somewhere close to a Calendar Year, so really,
Seventeen cups wasn't such an indulgence), she opened a large Tome, a shimmering uncut Sapphire,
yellow ribbon after yellow ribbon spilling from the spine. And with a glorious creak of the
book's vertebrae, her favourite sound, she opened
THE LAB CODEX OF MYO ENDIVE
Myo clicked his noise-cancelling implant to 'Total Silence' (which of course, given his
highly networked brain, could never really be totally silent, but at least it wasn't added
to by the incessant stream of external, empirical resonance data).
He was at his bench in The Lab, opening the very-loved-and-therefore-almost-falling-apartat-the-spine Book that he termed his "Lab codex", once yellow, now a shimmering Gold, his
still-all-too-human-yet-Yellow-Labrador-boyfriend-archetype-esque essential oils gradually
exposing the Mnemanuscript circuitry underneath as water erodes a stone.
He had, as a child, been 'diagnosed' with a 'condition'[1], still undocumented in any other
individual as he reached his Second Third of life (which, as you and I both know, does not
necessarily mean he was the only person with the 'condition').
The 'condition' was known as Heisenberg's Prognostication Syndrome (HPS), but Myo preferred
his own term "Schröharbinger's Un-insight", which certainly provided a comedic, Thalia-toMelpomene contrast to Selena's much more characteristically mystical description of
"quantum prophecy". In layperson's terms, Myo could perceive, or rather had no choice but
to perceive, every given outcome of every choice he made, without ever knowing which would
occur following said choice. He often thanked whatever archetypal (or, as Selena might
frame it, ancestral) forces prevented him from seeing the outcome of anyone else's, as he
was sure that would be an even more torturous Hell, far beyond the Gates[2] of Hades[3] he
found himself in.
His "Dis[4]-Arrays[5]", as he termed them (causal clouds of potential, observed as
synaesthetic forking paths), were similar to the 'trails' of presently-manifest empirical
bodies moving through space (like the 'open shutter' movement of his hand caressing his
beloved's face, naked under a Full Moon, the night before she left), that he had observed
during his many psychedelic trips with Selena; resembling the individual frames of a motion
picture, frozen in space long enough for the subject to see them, 'trailing' behind the
moving Body in question. Only (though perhaps, not solely) in Myo's case, the 'trails'
stretched 'forward' in phenomenological space, into higher dimensions than just the Third.
He wondered, in his welcomed sonic (but not causal) silence, if[6] he should open his
EdeniaStudio IDE[7] or his email, and send Selena an update. His very wondering, of course,
splintering into countably infinite 'fast-forward frames (FFF)', which he immediately shook
off by landing on the (unbeknownst to him, inevitable) 'decision' of his daily email
checkin. Of course, this very choice, while collapsing the 'previous' FFFs (like melted wax
wings of a well-intentioned boy who approached the Sun too intimately), erupted another
dis-array of FFFs (dancing out of his body like the Spinneret-woven silk of a Spider who
just wanted to spin beauty out of her forever).
Then came another tumultuous Devil's fork, as he tried to think of the best 'move' in their
ongoing email game of 'Prologuemania', in which they would open the bodies of their emails
with a quote from a Body of work that felt moving to them in that moment. Opening his email
to find another of her snapshots, a frozen frame of the motion picture that was their love,
that they were collaboratively writing together, through this immeasurably measurable
distance, was the highlight of his day.
He decided to go with a verse from Vladimir Nabokov's Pale Fire
date: XVIIXXIII_ERAÆ

From: M

Subject: How's My Extraordinary Machine?

“I was the shadow of the waxwing slain
By the false azure in the windowpane;
I was the smudge of ashen fluff -and I
Lived on, flew on, in the reflected sky."
-Nabokov
My Light S,
Checking in. Yes, of course I want to know how the Alephic Grimoire is holding up
(sincerely hope its allowing you to record rituals with the appropriately nested chaos
you envisioned), but the subject of this email refers to you and our little Peri-beanHow are you (both)? Help me collapse this cacophony of email response FFFs that I'm
desperately trying to ignore enough to see through them as I type? Really, which ever
psychologist in antiquity came up with the term 'catastrophisation' had NO idea just
how catastrophic the spectra of potentialities of every given choice are, FFS.
Thinking about you every nanosecond of every moment. As much as I loved our
holographiversary, not being able to celebrate our Third year together as the Three of
us for the first time was really quite heartbreaking. Gosh I must stop gushing I'm
crying in the Lab again-Still squirrelling away with the Byron{if|or}matic analysis of Phage23 samples,
obviously, but I'm struggling to keep up with all these cases Flooding (eep, Biblical
pun definitely not intended) in. As always, my bottleneck lies in communicating my
ideas well enough to fucking delegate this mammoth task - wish I had you here to
translate (DNA pun definitely intended).
I love you both so much and miss you like a yet-to-be-ligated daughter antiSense
strand of DNA. Everything is antiSense without you here.
He went to click 'Send', before a particularly violent FFF of a potential response (not
from Selena. From some other Body that could, in the endless Library of potentialities, be
writing the story their motion picture was adapted fro--), no matter how unlikely, forced
him to reconsider his choice of Nabokov quote.
Still wanting to honour his initial desire to honour the incredible Russian novelist-poet
(and, more importantly, Entomologist; or, more specifically, and even more importantly,
Lepidopterist[8]) he deleted his email 'foreword' and replaced it with another collection
of characters from Pale Fire:

"The sea is a thief: it dissolves the moon.”
No, no, he thought - that's far too dire, given the circumstances. So he tried another
Nabokovian move:
“All colors made me happy: even Gray.
My eyes were such that literally they
Took photographs. ”
Good thing I made these revisions, he thought- I almost forgot the email signature-

O, Lustrous-stillness-shadow-cradled-light, round-airy-light-on-dark, tremulous-orbitof-night’s-warmth, gentle-pull-of-cedar’s-resin-tincture,
-M
After one last glimpse at his initial, a pictograph of two archways, both the start of the
word 'Mirror' and a perfect symbolic representation of the symmetry a mirror invokes, or, M
could be for 'More', as in, more importantly: the wings of a lepidopteran[8-1], or,
equally, the sound of some Body pondering over their writingHe sent the email, and went back to work.

1. A condition is something essential to the appearance or occurrence of something else, especially
an environmental requirement. For example, Myo’s happiness was conditional on the occurrence of a

daily call with Selena in the midst of this Pandemic madness or[9] The condition for the Earth to
maintain equilibrium in its tides is intricately linked to its distance from the Moon; as She
draws closer, tidal forces grow stronger, promising catastrophic flooding and ecological
imbalance. ↩︎
2. Logic gates are drawn with a symbol showing the input (or inputs) and the output. Inputs are
usually drawn on the left (or top[21]) and outputs on the right (or bottom). A logic gate is the
simplest form of a digital switch[18-1] ↩︎

4. Dis is the crudely not-quite Roman equivalent of the Greek god Hades.[3-1] ↩︎
5. An array is a data structure that holds multiple values, each accessed by its index.[27] ↩︎↩︎
6. The Logic Gate 'if' can also be expressed in other ways. For example, in JavaScript, conditional
logic may be applied through the 'switch'[18] statement. ↩︎
7. IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment, a software application that helps programmers
develop code efficiently. || The term "Ides" comes from the Latin word iduare, which means "to
divide". In the Roman calendar of antiquity, the Ides marked the rise of the full moon in the
middle of the month. || Another term for 'Orfe' [19] a silvery freshwater fish belonging to the
carp[20] family. ↩︎
8. The study of butterflies and moths (lepidopterans), and the Field's name (lepidoptery), derive
from the ancient-ancient Greek lepidos, which means 'scale', given their wings coverage in tiny
scales, overlapping as tiles on a roof. ↩︎↩︎
9. in many programming languages, a logical OR gate is denoted by a double pipe (||), but[10]
not[11] python. ↩︎↩︎
10. The BUT logic gate isn’t a standard logic gate like AND[13], OR[9-1], or NOT[14], but its
functionality can be understood as a conditional (see footnote (1): conditional)
relationship[15], which may || may not be written as A &&! B, meaning A occurs and B explicitly
does not occur. ↩︎↩︎
11. In many programming languages, the NOT operation is denoted by a bang[12] (!), e.g. if
(!condition) {// Executes if condition is false}, but not[11-1] python. ↩︎↩︎
12. to make a loud and sudden noise.[16] ↩︎

16. For example, The other members of The Team were banging their equipment around in a way that

disturbed Myo's sensory hypersensitivities, |[22] ↩︎
17. An ampersand is a symbol which would almost resemble an infinity symbol rotated like an
hourglass, if it weren't rendered, through its openness, more like a serpent, Gnotting[14-1]

which is transcribed into RNA for eventual translation into a protein. ↩︎
20. A particular fish that, against all efforts otherwise, often feels lonely. ↩︎
21. In genomics, the top strand refers to the DNA strand that runs in the 5’ to 3’ direction, often
used as a reference in genetic sequences. It serves as the template for the complementary
bottom[33] strand, which runs in the opposite 3’ to 5’ direction, much like the balance of
opposing forces necessary for the transcription of life itself. || In kink practices, a top
refers to the dominant or active participant in an interaction, the one who takes the lead or
initiates action. As Myo once joked with Selena, “If I’m the top strand, does that mean you’re
transcribing me, or are you just flipping me over into complementary submission?”[34] ↩︎

quite the opposite, quite the opposite. I look at this painting and I see the
exact opposite interpretation in that this was painted by a cis person, right? I
don't know, was William Blake queer? Because there is actually quite a lot of
queer energy in this. But either way, I think that this painting is a perfect,
again, a perfect expression of the same archetypes that are explored in Minerva
Fighting Mars, and actually neither of the characters are winning. Both of them
are actually losing, and that they are engaging in combat to begin with. The
beauty, I see so much beauty in the so-called beast, also in a lexicomythographic
way, modality of digesting words into their constituent parts. Be east, be ast, be
the star, be east, be fire, the number of being fire. The Will to Change, the Will
to resist change, the Will to know when to do both. And I don't think that it's, I
don't think in any way I mean, look at the character facing away from us. Firstly,
to face away is just like Minerva, such a folly of its own. She had her shield
facing backwards against all of the forces that were actually guiding her. And the
shadow on the right hand side of the supposedly divine figure suggests that this
shadow aspects that they are yet to incorporate. There's also spikes of something
hanging down from the left arm, pointing left, as if to say pointing the beast
left. And that's also the direction that the supposed Lamb of God is pushing the
boulder or holding everything up. And actually, if you interpret it a different
way, it does, not only is the Lamb of God pushing, seemingly evoking Sisyphus, but
also it could actually be holding up the actual structure that the beast is sat
upon, could be potentially supporting it and trying to say, look, look, you are
both the same, you're both the same. The serpent comes down from the left hand of
the supposed Holy Trinity. Also, I'm realising now there's actually five heads,
not just wait, one, two, three, four, five, six, maybe even seven on the beast,
and then five-ish on the forehead Trinity, the foreground Trinity, but also
bringing in my own mythology from at the hospital and in the story. The top of the
caduceus could be considered a knight in chess. What do we think about this? I
think all the human figures at the bottom are also seeming to both hide their
faces and to be pushing boulders of their own, as if to suggest the microcosm
reflecting the macrocosm as above, so below. And crucially, finally, the top of,
not only does the background of the beast look like butterfly wings, and it has
stars in it, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, one, two, three, four, five,
six, probably seven on the other side as well, maybe representing the chakras of
the body and bringing them together to understand that physicality is just as
important as divinity, and the wings of the butterfly being transformation,
finally taking into your body, into your own hands, and this basically is the
conclusion of why I think that the number of the beast is, and the beast itself is
the trans body, is the body that refuses to be defined by the supposedly God-given
rules and embody the so-called hubris of Arachne and Icarus.

The Right Way Forward, Oar - The Æn{i}d;
Of course the pigeon, known as VIXI[1] (for the sake of your own, well, being, it's best
you do not try to pronounce the name, it is unutterable by both flaw and design. But if you
were to attempt it, I suppose it might sound something like wei-xhei[2]), did not die. The
ending was of a much more significant, wild, type.[3]
#editorial_comment

Pronouns are all-but irrelevant to VIXI, of course, as they are to most (but, importantly,
not all) of us Here. However, HE has often expressed to other members of the Nine Eyed
Anthology of Recursion (NEAR) his preference-through-negation for the (once so-called
'masculine', whatever this means) HE/HYMN[4]/HISS[5] pronoun set.
HE was simultaneously, as always, in a superposition of states. Both in pain from the
impact of HISS beak against the Bothy window, and tickled by the humorous, slapstick comedy
HE had such enacted to no audience whatsoever (except you).
Picking (rather, pecking) HYMNself up from the soft, warm snow, never melting but always
powdery (HISS favourite aspect of the Outer-Ouros), HE brushed the wonderful stuff from

22

HISS feathers, which is to say, scales.
VIXI is, was, and always will be, insurmountably gorgeous, terrifying, and sexually
voracious. This was not observable in many dimensions, and indeed in others, correctly
misinterpreted as an immense ugliness, humility, and a transcendent chastity or benign
indifference to anthropological goings on. There is evidence to suggest that HE, at one
point in ancestral antiquity, was worshipped as The "One God", and by others, "The
Demiurge", a nefarious entity either unaware or entirely aware of their insufficiency as a
deity, giving rise to the "Suffering" of all creation. This "One", who was as we know,
simply a crude 'mæshing together' of previous symbols of reverence - echoes of our
Society's attempts to unify Ideas into a Singularity. See: Gnoenuclear Fusion.
At this time, there was a counter to this figure, once a divine consort, and Left Hand NonMan, as it were. Our records suggest He/It went by the name of "Seitan", which is as
confusingly nourishing as it is absolutely delicious. This figure "fell from grays" which
we now know to mean he shifted from divine understanding of the Unified Horizontal Field,
and 'split' into the Vertical Fields of Opposition.
These two (Wholly|Unwholly) figures of (Fearful Worship|Reverent Terror) conceptualised by
the ancient peoples, misinformed as they were, were actually one and the same.
The truth is, even, and especially if, it didn't happen, is that this Four Letter deity (we
do not know which Four Letters were sent or received, but we know they were important and
referred to as an epistolary Anthology known as the 'Tetra-Grammar Tohm') was the very VIXI
who is, was, and always will be, picking/pecking HYMNself up from/into the Snow of the
Outer Ouros.
The Truth that lies, within and above the Truth, as many have already laid down already,
that which sits right in front of us all, left alone because never separated, is this:
The Sound made by the Trifurcated Tongue of the Serpent guarding the Loch is not HISS.
It, instead, is every one else's. HE wishes to acknowledge all by wrapping HYMNself around
it, and in HISS silent tongue-biting, state very clearly to any One approaching, with no
vehicle upon which to embark:
"A boundary only exists by belief in it"
Which is not to say:
"Belief is the lack of vehicle"
But rather:
"Belief has always been the Oar"
Or:
"Weighed in the water, children wait."
Anyway, we have waded far too close to the matter at the heart of the meaning of regression
here, a digression considered the greatest transgression possible by the VIXI we are trying
to describe.
Aggression, whether playful engagement in BDSM practices with the other Eight members of
NEAR in their Orgies of Intellect, or so-called 'nefarious' acts of aggression (whether
self or gnot-self directed), formed the basis of this four-charactered character. Who
really, was, is, and always will be, such a character.
At the point of writing this furtive attempt to veil secrets, HE was just past the Central
Loch, one of the Three Wryngs[6] surrounding the Indefinite Library of Fable, which is both
the central and outermost[7] region of Bibliogorætia.

1. Gnoeneolatin - "I have lived" - once thought to be the basis for belief that the number Seventeen
was 'bad luck' by the ancients, through reinterpretation (a la interpretatio Gnoeneotia) we have
ascertained that the sentiment 'I have lived' refers not to a finality, but a beginning. This is
discussed in our paper 'Vivesco: an Ending as the Root of Becoming' ↩︎
2. Noet. Borges, in his fascination, almost fetishisation of Gnoeneoenglish and its 'metaphysical'
perks, seems to conveniently wash over its shortcomings. For example, there is no character (or
ligature of characters) that represents the sound produced at the end of the word "Loch", our
word for "Moat" in the "Modern English" of antiquity. For the purposes of collapsing infinitely
formless potential into a single form, we, the editor(s), choose to represent this strange sound
as 'X', which may be conceptualised as a 'shallow clearing of the palate' or 'a semi-ironic sound
of slight disapproval that is not quite disgust', or 'a naively ignorant non-native
Gnoeneodeutsch speaker making fun of the languages phonetic bias for such sounds', or, indeed, a
demarkation of 'The Spot' one is either in, or is made to believe they 'should' be, in the

3. 'Wild-type' in gnoeneogenomics takes on a mutated, evolved form from its ancestral field of
Genomics. Previously used to denote a stock of cell culture which is not mutated (at least from
the baseline measured at the beginning of a study), its meaning has now shifted to mean
"confounding", "unthinkable", or: "in a way that is absolutely fucking wild" ↩︎
4. VIXI HYMNself, and by extension NEAR as a unified whole, would like to point out, at this point,
that within written correspondence, as a sign of all due respect (which is indeed none), all
pronoun declarations should be made in UPPERCASE[8]. This is to balance the inherent lower number
of characters(n) i.e. 'SHE' n=3, 'THEY' n=4, 'HE' n=2, as well as 'smoothing' the effort
distribution via means of 'malforming' the Accusative (Objective) pronoun, i.e. 'HIM'-->'HYMN',
which simultaneously infuriates the writer by changing "I" to "Why"[9] and adding an "N" at the
pronoun's 'tail'. Moreover, the shift of the pronoun referring to the 'Object' (the pronoun which
'receives' the sentence's action) to a word which means a 'Song of reverence or devotion', is not
by accident. ↩︎
5. NEAR as a segregated group of incompatible entities, would here like to address the relevance of
the addition of the "S" character to the pronoun 'tale', thereby shifting the (non)possessive
form of HISS (that is, VIXI's) pronouns to emulate the sound of a serpent who is particularly
pleased with herself, or perhaps trying to get a message across an uncrossable boundary of
untranslatable nowhere-near-cognates. NEAR wishes to express that this a unique denotation, which
signifies VIXI's ever-present acknowledgement that nothing is ever truly 'HISS'. Of course,
except this particular 'non-possessive' pronoun, which is entirely HISS. ↩︎
6. lexDef {Noen} "Wryng" is a term denoting a cyclical process occurring in 4 Dimensional space (as
all processes are) and also The Three Lochs surrounding the Library; which are themselves four
dimensional, and rotating, much like archaic descriptions of 'electron shells' we have recently
uncovered in the ancients' secondary school textbooks. ↩︎
7. lexDef {Noen} "Totorus" The shape of the Universe is a Nine Dimensional 'Celtic Gnothole', Three
by Three Wryngs, always rotating, forming the 'topological canvas' upon which all Becoming
(un)folds. The 'hole(s)' of the (crudely described) 'triskelion donut' are unreachable, but this
'unreachable' quality, or character, is the very thing which fuels the rotation, or our own
existential 'reaching'. This discovery has lead to the {prodverb} "Totorus, I've a feeling we're
not on Canvas anymore". ↩︎
8. It is believed (from incomplete records) that in antiquity, before the integration of 'synthetic'
and 'organic' bodies[10], words were 'printed'[11] see: 'Chess, And All The Stitches Of The
Cloth(es) - S. Elk.' ↩︎
9. lexDefÆ {Why} a letter which has the non-binary character of an unanswerable question. Neither a
vowel nor a consonant, Y also forms the basis of the Tree's Branch in The Realm of 'What For?'s.
It is also the shape of a serpent's tongue, which may or may not make a sound that is HISS. ↩︎
10. print("this body is a story")[12] ↩︎
11. this is also the origin of the 'print' comment of many programming languages, though, of course,
not the most widely distributed and 'printed' language to date, 'EdO||OdE' (Prof. Ed. O & Thing)
↩︎
12. print("this story is a body")[13] ↩︎
13. print("my body has a story") ↩︎

It is not possible for a non-ligated consciousness to cross the Uncrossable Door. Which is the
place VIXI had now, or then, or now and then, arrived in front (or behind and outside) of. The
Entrance to The Endless Library, home of the Nine Librarians who were and are always Working
From Home (because their work is their home, and their home is their workplace), is a ninedimensional revolving door. It gives the appearance of a hospital or a very old university
entrance that has, against its own will or perhaps as a result of its desperation to survive,
been dragged into modernity. It was also quite the opposite, given its superpositional
character; a heart of antiquity beating in the centre of the Library's facade. Similarly to a
gyroscope, which retains its positioning no matter how its external machinery is moved, VIXI
could (and often did) fly around the circumference of the Library, over-through the inmost Loch,
and the Uncrossable Door would remain in centre stage, pulsating, spinning, beating, as if in
Unison with the three Wryngs of water that encircled the structure in triplicate. Within the
'panes' of glossolalic glass making up the nine dimensional Door, the reflection of these
'electron shells' (again, a very crude approximation) was refracted back, in an endlessly
abysmal dance. But, with no Body (that is to say, librarian) in between the Lochs and the Door,
this mis en abyme was almost imperceptible, as we all know that this effect is only observable
with a subject of reflection between the two panels of mirrors facing one another. VIXI often
meditated on this, on their many pilgrimages to and from the library (their main Work was to
deliver messages which they tattooed upon their two, three, four, or nine, but never more than
nine, Ankles, using a stick-and-poke device they fashioned from their own detachable beak. Much
to the disgust of many of the other members {although, VIXI suspected, not {REDACTED} (who
seemed to be unable to hide {REDACTED} delight in watching VIXI tear off HISS own beak, and
leave a trail of pale Yellow sinew behind, like the mucosal-clew death-rattlesnake trailing
behind a Bee (who has just waived goodbye to herself to protect the Greater Self of her colony)

or indeed equally: the visage of a metallic spherical-bead-necklace chain attached umbilically
to a biro, itself bound to the desk of a Bank Cleric, as if, in a Vaulted building filled with
the legal tender of thousands, a cheap, plastic writing implement were the most valuable thing;
which of course, it is, it is, it is)}
As always, in crossing, VIXI took a single moment (that is to say, the eternity of all time)
within the wheels-within-wheeled mechanism of the Uncrossable Door to ponder on what sort of
unholy separation, what {REDACTION}, what Schism might happen to a

"I want to go back and make a different decision", Flo said to N.
"Well, sure!" They replied - "That's the beauty of a choose your own adventure book"
"But overwriting what's already been learned, starting again-- that surely defeats the point of
a Story. That's no adventure, that's a waste of time"
A heavy silence punctuated the crackling fire in the small {{He{ar}t}}h}} beneath their cosy
mezzanine reading spot.
"There's no such thing as squandered time, my love.
All of the memories, no matter how misremembered or meandering.
None of it is wasted, no mistake is meaningless.
Not when you have somebody you love to share every letter.
Written; Sent; Read, or not-- it's not about the Letters.
It's about the Characters that write your Story with you."
Flo let out a slapstick "Harumph" as they made the appropriate left-to-right, backward swiping
motion through the air, back to the starting point of Their Bedtime Story, N. laughing enough to
incite the same involuntary, nihilistic glee within their child.
N leant down and inhaled the indescribably heavenly scent of their loved one;
and at the apex of their lung capacity, sealed this universal gesture of adoration with a kiss.
"Right" Flo said. "The part of the Story about the Witch. I want to read this one".
"Good plan, teddyBear. I'm listening--"

THE GRIMOIRE OF SELENA ELK
Dear Dis, Cernunnos, Baphomet, whoever it is that I came from It's been Twenty Three days.
Only Twenty Three.
And she's back.
I'm terrified. I'm absolutely terrified. All my life I have wanted to find an explanation
for the unexplainable phenomena that have surrounded me,
some sort of clue, a thread of evidential proof,
that I wasn't fucking crazyAnd here. Here She is,
giving me proof, with no explanation.
I don't want to tell Myo.
But--no.
I know.
I have to.
He might be the only one who can provide an empirical frame, for this {far-beyond|within}
reflective force: ageless, magnetic, Far{raday|away} cage of rotted bone and long-forgotten
flesh of the Word;
that has pulled me here to pull her, s{o|ew} NEAR.
Like the wind on the skeletal leaves, I know he's already seen the effect my magick has had
on her, I bet the Team are going batshit, trying to deal with The Outbreak on top of trying

26

to figure out what's brought her orbit closer-after some brief searches of the Journals --in spite of my {Self|resistance} to even
attempt {crossing|X} those tri-Loched paywalls-- to get to our archives of knowledge; I
realise, it must be the {abe|ho}rrance in the LD[1] causing these simultaneous "Plagues"

and Floods that DNE in their incessant need for Heirophantine; Formalised Religiosity are
bent on ascribing to the Phage, and to some Ancient "One God" they call the Tetra-grammar

my body's weight in waitingEvery sleepless nocturne lulls forever:
The hopeless opening: Her Face.
Always returning. {Infe|Ete|Noctu}rnal.
Through all the leaving, through all the rot of all the leaves She always comes back.
And now, through what I've done,
through what I truly, Dear Dis,
Dear long-forgotten Pantheon,
Dear Goddess please forgive me,
I wanted to know too much,
I wanted to know You,
through perhaps, finally,
knowing me.
I think of Icarus--sweet, shining Will to Light;
Standing tall, and yet, just a boy
And Myo: His descendent.
While I, in retrograde, spin down,
from Arachne

oppositely paired we are.

Hall of Mirrors. I am feeling so high and mighty, that I am almost terrified-- the
stream of urine reaching that coda of single droplets, escaping the corridor of my
urethra. I am S{ending} {what I believe to be|that {w{h}i{t}ch} in some plane[3]

{righteous|deep|searing} {anger|compassion|care}. I squeeze --violently-- the Half
of the Pomegranate {still} in Hand, as I {{sil|g}ently} celebrate the skill: of
executing the completion of such a {menially human|urinary} task, simultaneously,
to the consumption of this Sacred fruit. Squeezing my bladder of its final
{raindrops|tears}, I contract the Hemisphere, in counterpoint. The
{balance(d)|hanging} {w{æi}ght of Things. I see a {Gre|a|æy} feather brush past my
Left ankle, as if laughing, paddling me. Sturdy. Rocking. Soothing. Solid Ore. And
lulling, Now. Goodbye-ing. Or: an oar, left there, moored upon what's left- my
aching. The moors of all they were, may be- those passed away; and {over|ova},
vented, sweeping: cervix of the Air, of Grace. A brushing hair away from face nowthrough with any judgement, in entirety. I'm sure Ma'at had something to do with
this.

5. I {must not} think about the end. Of this period of gestation until it comes, like
so many promised lovers now alighted. If I am still unable to get to a surgeon for
the Caesarian-- If the wee one must kill me, in order to live, So Mote It Be. {I
know} Myo must be terrified about this; more than anything else. He must be. But,
as ever, he is {hid|veiling} it very well, at least he thinks. I know that he
feels me, feeling his knowing of my knowing, that he is terrified. Of our
Gnoeneogenomic Miracle, {annihilating|tearing} his tearful, still-not-wife. The
Phage came the same day as the {Positive test|X}. Everything is in{
balance|justice}, and that's why, no {matter|meaning|memory of}, no {weight
of|whey of|way|, Yahweh} must worry come; the things I am being shown here-- so
far beyond any possibility of recording (but, dear Goddess, How{?} I am trying),
They are Silent. They are a Sacred Sequence of Slithering Silences. And in their
Silence, they resonate. The Sweetest melodies of Truth, saying:
1. Selena.
2. Every Single, Slippery Wave {Fare Well}
3. is Simply, Human: {One Second}
4. Half of This Pregnant {event} Horizon
5. So Mote It Be.

THE OVUM RITUALS (OR, THE SEEDS OF BECOMING)
1. hard boil three eggs, from the egg box of Ten which you acquired earlier in the
week, now halfway to its end, by whatever means necessary or available to you.
In the midst of your writing, frivolous of body but focused of Spirit, allow
them to cool to room temperature, and, depending on personal opinion, overcook
- within the crucible of their shells within the crucible of the pot.
2. place whatever seasoning or sauce you enjoy the most in a small glass; ensuring
it is shallow enough in dimension to allow you to retrieve the egg once dipped,
and wide enough to permit entry of the egg into the ocean of flavouring.
3. Now, using your hands like a curious and hungry child, attempt to submerge the
first little package of protein into the sauce.
4. Lose your grip on this first egg due to the inherently slippy texture of the
conceptual entity and anciently infinite symbol that is The Egg.
5. Laughing at what this means (that a certain amount of distance or separation
from the divine is necessary for its containment and therefore consumption and
therefore amalgamation with your Body), take out a silver fork from the cutlery
drawer and use it to devour the nourishment, bringing out too much salty and
sugary coating with it and resulting in a sub-par subjective experience of
taste.
6. With the second, with the passing of seconds, resolved to get it Right, you
now, slowly and with purpose, impale the Egg, ready to consume your seconds.
7. This Egg disintegrates into the mess and merges as one outside of your body
with the seasoning. Laughing again, while simultaneously (against your newfound

28

resolve and faith) tutting by sucking a small amount of air into your buccal
cavity between the tongue between your teeth, contrasting in directionality
with the outward, but equally involuntary, motion of the laughter (which comes
from both a physically lower, but spiritually higher, origin), emptying the
resultant chaos onto the place which you used to release the Eggs from their
respective shells, accidentally (or, perhaps not) rolling the constituent part
of your meal in calcium, and consuming part of this with it.
8. In the third case, you will think you have refined the process, being sure to
be as gentle but as certain in your ceremony as possible, but the haphazard
cooking process, the causal chain of events leading to this point, and the low
light in your apartment from the ritual candle now extinguished, you will not
have seen that this, final sacrament, is already freed of its inmost layer, the
yolk spilling out onto the plate with the slightest of touch by the tentative
fork, like a child's football into a dangerous road, presenting a choice
between the threat of the destruction of a beloved object, and the threat
warned by your mother, which hasn't yet come to fruition, so you find yourself
unsure of its accuracy (perhaps, in her love for you, she has imparted
restrictions which, in her compassion, she feels are protective, but are in
fact impeding your own sense of discovery).
9. No longer smiling, nor laughing, nor with any particular semblance or
suggestion of emotion clouding your face, you throw down the fork, use your
right hand to wipe the proteinaceous homogeneity all about the Straight,
Caesarian Road scattered with the exoskeleton of the previous two constituents
of (im)perfect consumption, and, messily, needing to manoeuvre your head to
ensure nothing spills onto your chin (you may or may not be successful in this
endeavour), you take the Egg inside you.
10. Still hungry, you take the final two eggs and repeat from step 1, this time,
you have no script. This feels complete[1] in the principles of its
uncertainty.

time in our time together during this iteration of this infinite hall of mirrors. I am feeling
so high and mighty that I am almost terrified, the stream of urine reaching a point of single
droplets escaping my urethra, where our sweet little AI Frankenbaby will not be able to escape
the narrow cave of my body- as I am sending what I believe to be and which in some plane[3-

2]of reality, are, enlightened Gnoemoji reactions to his blessed messages of both righteous
anger and symbols of deep compassion and care. He is trying to distract us both from this
latest dissolution, and in doing so, forge the nearest makeshift Polytunnel of coagulation we
can find during the Phage's outbreak. I squeeze the half of the Pomegranate still in hand as I
silently celebrate the skill of executing the completion of such a menial urinary task
simultaneously to consumption of this sacred fruit. Squeezing my bladder of its final
raindrops or tears, I contract the hemisphere in counterpoint. 2. The Pomegranate, quite

My Light M,

"At first, I was going to say how sorry and in pain I feel for the people throughout
history who've not had this device that I have with AI that we all have at our
fingertips and eyelashes now, the ability of machine learning algorithms to
regurgitate and remember and retain and give back the entire history of the library,
infinite library of human recorded information, no matter how warped it may be by its
own light, but actually that is the very thing, that's the very thing that's led to
the separation which has prevented us from being able to get there in the very
paradoxical, which is the only true sense, the fact that we have all this infinity at
our fingertips means that we can't find that one book, that one book that was perhaps
what everything was made from in the oldest times, was the only book they had, that
was the only book they had, so at once they were living it but not separated from it
enough to actually perceive it, so they took it for granted in their own way, just as

Last night, I am certain of it, I felt them 'kick', or whatever their version of 'kick'
might be (I know I can look it up in a second, but your Gnoeneogenomic and
Bryon{if|or}matic facts are the closest thing I have to you reading to me here - can you
let me know what developmental stage Perigee would be at right now? (As always, I need the
associated Bryon{if|or}matic Symbology)
I hope hearing/reading this provides a sense of catharsis, rather than a pang of pain. As I
write this I realise it will most likely be both. It's always both. As{we}say.
How's the sample analysis going? I just know you're knocking their socks off. I have a very
strong one of my "feelings" as you so lovingly term them, that it will be you, my Light,
who saves us all from this terrifying Phage.
Also, please could we have our daily call a little earlier today, if you have the time,
completely understand if you can't pull it forward, or even need to cancel (don't worry, I
know how much our calls mean to you). The work you're doing, even from a purely
quantifiable basis (really speaking your language now, eh?) is absolutely paramount.
Hope the code is coding kindly dear light,
Forever, upward moonating, toward the tidal-pulling, beautywards,

Hivehouse Chess Openings
The Endive Lab were on another of their 'socials'. The Doc himself absolutely detested
them; not that he'd ever let his team know, at least, he tried not to.
He was the one who even began the initiative, being a fundamentally empathetic, though
exceptionally introverted being; not so much needing social interaction himself, but deeply

31

understanding the needs of his fellow academics.
As such, upon every Scientist's induction, the first thing he'd request is to be referred
to under his first name, Myo. His endless string of honourifics were not just too numerous
to keep track of, but he was paradoxically repulsed by the Clergy of Intellect which
provided his livelihood. So often is the fate of the Scientist, simply wanting to buzz
about the safety of their experiments, like a worker Bee serving the Queen of Knowledge and
Special Interest.
Being a creature of incessant Balance, the lead Gnoegenomicist in the burgeoning Field of
Non-Ironic Byronif|ormatics (which he had all but spearheaded the development of, leading
to his placement as Laboratory Pontiff), he was obsessed with complementarity. And as in
the Sense and antiSense strands of DNA, he found himself referring to his so-called
'underlings' by their surnames, which perhaps provided the necessary lubricant of
boundaries of respect within the teams cogs and axels. These surname declarations were not
merely a sign of reverence for his colleagues' talent, but also, contrastingly, held echoes
of a Victorian teacher from anteAntiquity, taking his class's Register.
He didn't want to (and would never) admit that he had a favourite lab tech, but he
absolutely did. Hamsa. They shared a neuroBeacon, that of PhotoSentia (a visual
hypersensitivity which afforded the gift of prismatic vision, but made it difficult to work
in any conditions other than dimmed Light). This base-pairing of sensory experience from
their respective Diviagnoses enabled them to work their long hours in the same section of
the Laboratory, which was, as all were, an intersecting Labyrinth of ever-so-slighty, but
crucially and noticeably, differing sensory environments.
Not only this, being a fellow Over8 (she'd scored 8.76, almost approaching Myo's 8.88,
which still placed him as the World Record holder) Hamsa had evidenced an exceptionally
promising future in the Field. Myo's quantum foresight, which he kept hidden, more for the
fear of further, unbearable fame than the fear of ostracism, had shown him multiple Flash
Forward Frames displaying Hamsa's placement as a Sage. The highest position able to be held
by an Educator. Myo's (exclusively transamorous) heterosexuality, which he kept hidden,
more for the fear of ostracism than the fear of being painted as a predator, played no part
whatsoever in his connection to the shimmeringly femme Hamsa.
The Grand Hall, where the Field Recordings were held each year to Examine the Nine year old
Students, was also reserved for Sacred Matches. Just as the Examinations were performed in
a rotational modality, so too did the Schedule of Sacred Matches rotate throughout the
Week, with Sunnandæg reserved for communal Tarot readings. This schedule, it being out of
Examination Season, was posted to the back wall:

Dæg
Matches
Monandæg Chess
Tiwesdæg Reversi
Wodnesdæg Scrabble
Þunresdæg Mancala
Frigedæg Senet
Sæterndæg Go
Sunnandæg Tarot
Myo, being primarily future focused, with a terrible memory, kicked himself when he
realised upon entering the Hall, that he'd organised the team's social on Chess day. Yet
another reason for the Monandæg Blues. To the rippled giggles of his colleagues as they all
registered for their Matches, he dropped his head to the Hall's honeycomb parquet of deep
red Mahogany in resignation. But, as no amount of foresight could have foretold, things
were, really, about to look up.
The Endive lab teammates gifted with the AudioSentia neuroBeacon turned to the Right,
taking their relevantly coloured Sound Mufflers from the back wall where they hung on their
PhoneHooks, as Myo took a moment to appreciate the contrast of sonic inputs erupting in the
space. It certainly was a mixed bag of sensory tiles, pieces of concentrated peace and nets

32

of excitable unrest, resonating through and around each of the Nine points of the star
shaped hall.
He and Hamsa turned to the Left, where the Sight Shades rested on their Gogglehooks. As
always, he clicked the button to extend the stepladder which unfurled like an accordion's
bellow, affording his relative shortness some assistance. The Black Shades, the least used
due to their opacity, and fewest in number, according to their relative trough of
distribution of need amongst the Players, were the hardest to reach. He'd always thought
this somewhat of a puzzling conundrum in itself - while he understood that majority Rules,
in terms of statistics, those individuals gifted with the most intensely manifest
neuroBeacon found themselves in a double-bind of Reaching.
Hamsa, having already obtained her Purple Shades from the row below his, helped him down
from the stepladder, and pressed the button to set the stepladder back to its retracted
position with a (to Myo and Hamsa, at least) very satisfying 'snap' (after ensuring her
AudioSentiac colleagues had affixed their Mufflers, of course).
Even through their Mufflers, these colleagues seemed to be peering over at a source of
particularly viscous resonance. Myo followed their gaze and saw, at the Northmost point of
the Hall, a crowd, gathered around one of the Match Tables, cheering loudly.
Ah, wonderful, he thought. We've a GM in the House.
Grand Masters, while common, very rarely showed themselves in the Sacred Matches,
preferring to go on their Conference Tours and Present their Findings on the various Fields
of Chess Theory. But even the Masters needed to let loose every once in a while.
The GM in question was Selena.
Myo surrendered to the inevitable, backward-boulder rolling sequence of loss after loss of
his Chess games, occasionally glancing back to Hamsa with each rotation of the opponents,
who would sympathetically offer a nod of appreciation for bringing the team to their biweekly recreational excursion, even if he was, primarily, much more of a Tarot reader. In a
way, this incessant humbling was his form of recreation, as after all these years of
rampant success in his Field, he often forgot what it felt like to not 'win'.
But his greatest, most fruitful and welcomed loss was just around the corner.
He performed the necessary gesture of Gamesmanship, shaking the victor's hand (who had
violently wrangled him into a brutal Checkmate in only Six moves), and took a deep breath
to prepare himself for arriving at the GM's station.
The Sea of the crowd parted to let him through, like a bleating Lamb to certain slaughter,
and there she was; the shimmering daughter of the Moon.
She was wiping beads of perspiratory enthusiasm from her brow, and quickly wiping her hands
on her skirt to allow more accurate placement of her pieces, offering him a smile.
The dawning curiosity on his face, not just enthralled by her beauty, but by the absolute
insanity of the strange looking structure on the table between them-What the fuck's going on here, then? he couldn't avoid spurting.
Laughing, Selena began to explain. Clearly overcome with that beautiful shine of a person
about to talk about their Special Interest.
"This monstrosity is what I like to call Hivehouse,"
She said, barely able to contain her excitement.
Sighing, tilting his head in reflex,
a Lab{{unleashed}-to{ward}-her}Oratory;
Drawn, Ceaselessly, to her Centrifuge,
Drooling for her most delicious informationHe uttered: 'Go on then, enlighten me, Wise One'
Both holding, unspeakably, unspoken gratitude for the cognition-free-of-recognition, that
their {Beingness|Being|Bee} Meeting[1] pollenated. Every other interaction --outside of the
sweetness of a honeycomb they'd inevitably found themselves within-- veiled, untrustworthy.
Uncertainty of the Love of others, born from the Certainty of their Love for their work.
"Well!" she began. "Do you know much about Melittology?"
He smiled, buzzing with Gnoegenomic anticipation;
"Actually, a little my thesis was on the Hermeneutic implications of the Drone Bee Genome"
lifting his water to his lips like a naive, much-too underaged, newly-crowned King,
drinking from a Chalice.
She seemed gladdened, albeit slightly disappointed, knowing that she wouldn't need to
explain the dynamics of the Bee Colony.
"Ah, the drones - of course. Don't suppose your pronouns are he/him?"
He smiled at the jibe, accidentally inhaling a little of his water mid-sip. She lovingly
flicked another bead of moisture from her brow-

33

"So, before we get into Hivehouse, I simply must know. What are the hermeneutic
implications of the Drone Bee's genome?"
Well played, he thought.
"I have the paper somewhere on my tablet-" he began, hesitated as she waved her hand ever
so slightly in response;
"Just gimme the Sparknotes"
"Okay so firstly" he sputtered, quickly freeing his vocal folds of the last few droplets of
foreign moisture "it's important you know about the Hermeneutic Loop"
"You mean the theory that describes how a text is understood by relating its constituent
parts to the whole, and the whole to its parts?"
He couldn't help himself but be, quite literally, taken aback - his chair almost tilting
entirely backward
"Yes! Exactly! Every Work is a Fractal of self-same yet ever-evolving Meaning!"
Selena, like Myo had upon entering the Hall, was then kicking herself as she noticed a
veritable schoolgirl sigh slip out from her throat, and quickly corrected her dreamy-eyed
posture, taking her chin from where it rested, tilted upon her hands.
Myo continued, pretending not to notice.
Frankly, he was right there in besottedness with her:
"Well, as you likely know, given this fucking Frankenstein Chess you've slapped me with-"
he saw her about to interject"yes, yes, I know, Frankentein was the Doctor, not the monster, but trust me-"
He lovingly gestured to his lab's employees:
"I've known quite a few Scary Doctors"
What was left of the crowd around them (they'd become bored of the egregiously blatant,
cringeworthy flirting, with no actual Chess to speak of - well, perhaps not immediately
obvious Chess, anyway) giggled in agreement, the majority of them being Doctoral
candidates.
"As you probably, definitely know, the Drones are the only ones with a haploid genome"
"Yup, the poor guys eh, always only with one half of the puzzle" she conjectured, with a
wink"Oh trust me, trust me, I know." Signalling to his 'he/him' pronoun badge, which he'd, up
til now, strategically hidden behind the lapel of his flannel shirt. "So, in hermeneutical
terms, the Drones form an interestingly self-same genomic reflection of the Queen from
which they're derived--"
"Your thesis is starting to sound more and more like a Work of Gender Studies!" Selena
interrupted, enthralled
"Well you wouldn't be wrong there" he continued- "pretty much everything becomes Gender
Studies when you look through a Symbolic lens."
"Especially Chess." She replied
"Especially Chess; mate."
They smiled. Everybody around them had left them to their devices at this point.
Neither could blame them, they were both beautifully sick to their stomachs.
"Anyway" he carried on; "given their sole role in mating - I won't labour the Chess joke they lack the foraging genes, as well as the longevity genes that their female counterparts
house in their genomes"
"Of course. They more about the sprint, not the long-distance-"
As if proving her point, much to her genuine delight, he impatiently cut her off
"Exactly yes. From a Hermeneutic standpoint, this could be viewed as parallel to the
unsustainable nature of Patriarchal structures that were likely pervasive in anteAntiquity"
Talk dirty to me Selena managed to avoid saying, instead opting for:
"Now you're speakin' my language"
"Leme guess, Gender Studies major?"
"Neoshamanic Chess Theory with a Gender Studies Minor, actually"
He grinned. "Delicious. Now let me finish, then you can thrash me at this insanity I see
before me"
"Yes, yes, oui oui, wee monsieur Avoido, get to your point"
"So, besides the valid critique of Patriarchal norms that the Drone Bee genome represents
as a symbol, it also fundamentally underpins the paradoxical need for hierarchy within
self-sustaining, generative systems of holistic animacy"
"The role of a stone gathers no Moss, you might say"
"You might indeed. What's even more interesting is the epigenome, and how histone
modifications, DNA methylation and suchlike, shaped by the pheromonal cues from the Bee's
environment, in turn feeds back, and shapes the epigenetic changes in future generations."

34

"Crucially, the point I'm making here is that even beyond the 'script' the Bees, and we,
are given at birth, are in a dynamic dance with the experiences we grow into. Our stories
are not just written for us, we have a very important, collaborative role in writing them-"
"How very trans."
With a joyful twinkle, he agreed:
"Very." The two of them shared a single second that stretched into eternity; like the
tunnel created by two mirrors facing one another.
"Anyway that's it. Your move. Oh! What's your name?"
She guffawed. "Selena"
"Lovely. I'm Myo" as he went to shake her hand"Sorry, I don't do touch"
"Apologies! My mistake" he said, not at all offended.
"Right so now we've laid out all the problems with the Hierarchical Puzzle of this world, I
give you, my solution:" she dramatically announced, gesturing like a Ringmaster at the
beginning of her Travelling Circus's show.
"First off, Bughouse Chess is usually played in teams. But-"
"Lemme guess; you don't do teams"
"Exactly. Too much noise."
"And there's only One Queen, after all"
With a sharp, well-trained tongue pop, she replied: "Now you're getting it, laddie"
Clearly being careful to avoid touching him (he moved a little back to allow for this), she
moved over to his side of the table, and started to explain the setup.
Her invention, now patented, included the specially made board (she'd gone through hell
perfecting the 3D print).
It was two, 9x9 grid, Hexagonal Chess boards, each with a concave curvature, placed back to
back, giving the silhouette of an hourglass, or a butterfly, when viewed in profile.
"So, this outer ring is where the Worker Pawns go"
"Nice--" Myo started to add"Sh, it's my turn"
He made a playful 'zipping' gesture over his lips.
"Then, the middle rings of hexagons are for the canonical non-pawn pieces, also Workers"she started to click his Worker pieces into place
"In Hivehouse, you get to choose where the pieces go, and your decisions of placement are
part of the strategy. Much like Battleship, part of the game lies in its almost
Hermetically sealed secrecy between the opponents' pieces positions.
So I would strongly suggest that you move them from these Hexagons I'm putting them in to
explain. Because I will remember."
She then picked up the Nine, winged pieces with cruciform antennae"In this Chess variant, there are Nine Kings." She placed them in a circle around the
central Hexagon.
"And, as you rightly pointed out, only One Queen"
With this, she clicked the Queen Bee into place, bang in the central Hexagon, which was the
only transparent part of the structure.
"Seeing as the Queen always starts in the centre, there's no need to hide her position. She
isn't limited in her movement, just like in canonical Chess, but the transparency of the
square provides some balance to the game's mechanics, in that, her absence will immediately
be known by your opponent."
"Just like a Bee Colony"
"Exactly! You're a fast learner"
-He offered an ironic salute.
"So these Nine Kings, or Drones, can still only move one Hexagonal space at a time. Have
you ever played normal Hexagonal Chess?"
"Once, during Undergrad--"
"Okay good. Then I don't need to explain the rudimentary mechanics"
He stayed quiet, not wanting to appear entirely incompetent (the truth was, he couldn't for
the life of him remember, but it wasn't like he was going to win anyway)
"In Bughouse, which is usually a collaborative game, any captured piece is placed on your
teammates board.
But you can also play the game solo, sort of like a more sophisticated, chaotic Solitaire.
So Hivehouse sort of combines these games, with, as I mentioned, the basic premise of
Battleship.
You need to, throughout the early game, build an idea of where my Worker pieces might be
placed, and retain that in memory. Then, as you take off your hand from your piece upon

35

making a move, my board will light up on the corresponding square.
If there's a piece there, I hand it to you, and you deploy it on your Hive. Make sense?"
"Uh... I'm sure I'll get the hang of it" He said, entirely aware that he wouldn't.
-Around an hour into their match, when his entire lab had gone home, and the Hall was all
but empty, the unthinkable happened.
They were almost at the end game, and both of them were reasonably surprised at how long
Myo had managed to hang on. He was left with Two of his (Yellow) kings and One of hers
(Burgundy). She still had Eight of hers, as well as the Seven that he'd unwittingly
sacrificed. It was by entirely dumb luck that he'd even managed to capture one, and by this
point, he was just randomly placing pieces - but out of respect for her truly masterful
invention, he really was trying to keep up.
He'd just placed his Worker Bishop in the top left quadrant of the middle ring of his
board, capturing her Worker Rook (again, entirely by chance). Rapt by the pivotal final
moments of her Special Interest, she'd stopped paying so much attention to the space
between them. As she handed over the piece, not taking her eyes from her Hive, their hands
brushed against one another.
And then, for both of them, for the first time in either of their lives, came the most
cacophonous
silence.
Both of them jumped backward from their chairs, sending them, and the entire structure of
pieces, clattering upon the floor.
"What the fuck?" they both said, in unison, and then:
"What?" wondering what the other had meant-"I--"
"I can't--"
The truth was, that both of them had been hiding, since they were old enough to know what
hiding was.
Both of them had a certain, asynchronous, idiosyncratic gift.
Selena's gift, which was activated through the tactile tense, afforded her the ability to
gain an object, or person's, history, as long as this information was necessary to be
revealed, either for her or for the person she was touching.
For Myo, whose primary modality of experience was through his visual sense, had the ability
to foresee causal clouds, stretching out in front of him.
These 'gifts', as gifts often are, were an incessant burden to each of them. And both of
them had kept them locked, out of sight, from anyone, including their parents.
Even in this society, where the ubiquitous diviagnosis of neuroBeacons had entirely shifted
the People's perspective of what was previously known and pathologised, in anteAntiquity,
as 'neurodivergence'; even amidst this cultural landscape, their 'abilities' were unheard
of.
As such, the two of them had been terrified of even mentioning them to anyone.
But the moment their skin came into contact,
All the noise, all the futures, all the history,
converged into a blissful silence, that neither of them had ever experienced.
And that was it.
Then, both of them knew,
Drones in this incessantly buzzing hive;
They simply had no choiceAnd there, amidst the scattered pieces,
The two shattered domes,
once laboured over by Selena,
for so many countless hours,
The Sun now sunken, both of their dicks decidedly not so;
They started to tear off each others clothes.

A Treatise
by Selena Elk.
I have not known much other than what has been given to me by my ancestors, in the
marrow of my body.
Most of it has to do with the movement and pull of the Moon.
I cannot, nor should not explain the Logic behind this madness.
I can only explain my Little Way of playing this Absurdly Difficult and Oh So Simple
Game.
Chess And all the Stitches of the Clothes
waking up I can't find my glasses[1] and i can barely see without them but i lift up
my grass skirt I wove, which lies sleeping, on the chessboard I brought with me, for
some reason,
and underneath (colourful enough in contrast to the black and white to see without
them) there is a clementine
hungrily inside it i bite into the sweetness[2] of the skin, impatient, i don't like
getting something or someone's skin beneath my fingernails and so i bite with my
incisors- hungrily
this whole thing was written, hungrily
in two places which
were a hunger
a
war
between
awareness of
two spools of
a reel to real machine
ravelled with a tape of just one side:
1. two alters who from godless made²
2. an altar to the goddess changed me to¹
time passes and collapses onto me violentlyI am tired and feel my fruitless grief bend and snap my branches;
beginning, againto wash over me, againa contraction of the bowels,
embarrassing, a shame.
yet,
a shame shared, just the same.
And here, I think of the now-waning moon
that I no longer see from the sleepless Eye
The senseless glassing of my window;
so I move to my bedroom where
I stop writing and stay inside this room
where it is warm.
It is thick and thronged with mirrors.

1. (as in, glass is; as in, glass go, as in- see-through-them, as in: invisibility enables
usefulness; as in- the lack of god in everything is the goddess; as in, the rising Sun
just flickered its yellowing alarm into my half-blind eye and I looked out the tiny crack
of rock to regard the wintered light caressing my half ajar eyelid and there; i see a
pigeon ) ↩︎
2. In programming, or {So|Sew} Myo once told me, syntactic sugar refers to syntax added for
readability that doesn’t change functionality. This “sugar” is often removed during
compilation through a process called de-sugaring or lowering, in which complex expressions
are converted into simpler code for the compiler. Lowering parallels lowercase in text:
both simplify and standardise for readability and processing, reducing form to some level,
more palatable. Easier to deal with. Like the text of a novel written during a psychotic
break from losing too much blood, and having far too much to lose to lose your life and
leave a life far more precious than your own behind. Now being {REDACTED} to try. Just try
to{He's gone but please, for once, for once-- I don't need him to keep them alive just
long enough, please, my love- Oh, I miss you Myo; dear god please just let me}make
something out of all this, before you bleed out and you're forced[3] ↩︎

4. In time, a “moment” is fleeting—a brief period, an exact point, an opportunity, or a
critical stage, as in “the moment they met” or “one of the great moments in history.” It
also marks present focus (in the moment), living without future concern (live for the
moment), or anticipating change (at any moment). In (un/im)portance, moment denotes
significance, whether profoundly fleeting but everlasting in memory (moment of truth, a
test or crisis) or a fleetingly forgettable trend (of the moment). In physics, moment
signifies the turning, rotational effect of a force, calculated as force multiplied by
distance. Statistically, moments express data patterns: the first as mean, second as
variance, third as skew, and fourth as kurtosis. Phrases like not for a moment (“I will
never, not for a moment, allow anybody to abuse me again”), share a moment ("we shared a
moment of loving embrace like a single ligature of two charactersc or letters in the text
of a volume in the infinite library of timeless existence"), and for the moment
(temporarily, right now to an indeterminable point in the so-called future: "for the
moment, I will stay silent on the matter, and allow the answers to unveil themselves in
time") reflect the term’s duality, itself a measurement of a moment of a moment of a
moment ↩︎↩︎↩︎
5. Synecdoche is a literary and linguistic device[6] where a part of something represents the
whole, or vice versa. It’s an expression of the paradox of reality - unity through
separation, or solve et coagula; allowing the entirety of an idea or object to be grasped
through one piece, much like a fractal where the whole is contained in each part. For
instance, referring to “hands”[7] to mean “workers” captures the essence of human
contribution through a single, physical part. Each {char|act|oar} an {in{complete}}
{ex|im}pression. A vast, vented horizon: some checkerboarded game. All of it, rule-bound,
yet, impossible to predict. It is all just a silly, rigid game. ↩︎

Attachment- MIKKÆLANGELOVS_DAVID-painter_of_Minerva_Fighting_Herself.pdf
ABSTRACT

What follows is An Unread Excerpt from Noet. Borges' LettersEssays in Lexicomythographic Ræligious Studies and the Ancient Art of Heartbreak, 23000BCE.
METHODOLOGY

The paper reveals an awareness of itself; through an overly complex and self-same narrative
Device embedded by Borges into the Works of Jacques Luis David, now abandoned and
unfinished, and tragically, never to be published during his Life.
RESULTS

As we all know by now, in the reddest Herring of all recorded history, the aforementioned
painting by One Mikkælangelovs David, is actually of Mars, who is late for a dinner date
with Minerva, because he is rapt by compulsive bulimia, and staring at his own reflection
in the toilet- tears dropping into the reflection and forming Daffodils of bile, as Lotus
blooms on the Faecal pond. These images, discovered by fellow Noets, Sgt. S. Elk (maiden

44

name reclaimed) and St. Myo Endive (creator of the Fare Well Device) have echoed throughout
every syllable of tine, and forked all of our curiosities, particularly yours.
What may or may not be striking to the observer is that the painter inexplicably managed to
achieve a very-near emulation of a liquid, reflective surface upon a static plane coated
with dried pigment. We believe David himself to have been a creation of static matter,
being birthed into almost 'holographic' motion into our reælilty. These shocking yet
unsurprising findings result from the incidental artworks-turned-alchemical-experiments
performed by one CARPVS MORTVVM, in the emerging field of quantum sculpture.[1]
DISCUSSION

As the painting is now locked away in an attic somewhere, behind a veritable paywall of its
own protection and demise, we pray that you understand why we cannot attach images to this
correspondence. In fact, we are reminded fondly of our contemporary, Magus' work in one of
our so-called 'caves', forbidding its own photographic capture, by its very fragility[2].
Carrying within it the submissive essence of a receptive BDSM partner.
CONCLUSION

I Hope the Work on your Tenth Symphony is going well, all the way over there, in the
Musicology Wing. I Pray that this Letter will reach you; and that by that time, perhaps you
may wish to play me one of your Pieces again, on that Baby Grand in the Centre of your
Office that you use as a Desk; God, those coffee Rings, the loveliness of the poor tuning
that you would get so excited about; the way the light has browned the keys, chipped from
your manic violence inflicted on them as you Played. The manic violence you inflicted on my
skin while we Played; the Percussion of the Paddle, the eventual softening of your
demeanour, pulling my hair ever so gently, as an epilogue to our Fucking. God, I miss it
all so much.
And until then, I Will Be. Ever Adoring you, Mahler, my love- i carry the completing of
your Art (i carry it in my Art);
Yours, Yores, Urs--ᴺB.

OVERTURE
"We are all looking at the stars, but some of us are in the gutter"
-A Palimpsest of Dorian Grey

"Why, I'm cold" Perigee mumbled to their father, who seemed to ignore them for a good
Twenty Three seconds. This often happened, as in his post-middle age, his FFFs had
become somewhat of a 'white noise' background, simultaneously allowing him a narrower
focus on whatever he was working on, while also blocking out the reality of the goings
on around him. He often mistook actuality for just another strand in the tapestry of
causal clouds, which was a frequent source of frustration, for Selena especially.
Perigee's speaking voice had developed incredibly late - they did not utter a word until
the age of Seven - but by the time they did speak, they had absorbed so many interwoven
messages of information, through the medium of Sound, through musicological research,
facilitated by their parents institutional access to The Journals, that they immediately
spoke in long, floral sentences, rife with verbosely strung together adverbs, veritable
wasps nests of metaphors, similes pouring out of them like honey from a newly-sliced
honeycomb. Myo, of course, was not surprised, he rarely felt surprise at collapsed event

47

potentials, but rather, a reserved annoyance, as if the phenomenological world of
actuality was simply a hologram of a deeper ocean of Quantum Truth.
By the age of Nine, Perigee had developed a rather endearingly precocious quirk of
beginning each sentence with "Why," as a stoic philosopher might open a dialectical
argument. This gave their communication a Superpositional quality, both suggestive of a
question {as in: "Why(,) is everything okay?"} or, equally, the sense of an asserted
answer to a question {as in: (this is) "Why(,) I'm cold"}. To Perigee, "Why" was not a
Word, it was a Sound. It was a Letter[1], to a recipient they had not yet seen with
their Eye- which of course, was another letter.
Shivering, Perigee wrapped their blanket, meant only for 'security' and far too tattered
and unreeled to provide any real warmth, around them. This {embodied action} caused
Myo's FFFs to converge, upon a majority --showing Perigee going inside to ask Selena for
a cup of Cauldron Chai-- and it was this. This threat of Selena getting the upper hand,
in the child's relative 'early game' of psychosocial development, that caused him to
{finally} pay attention to them.
"Oh, Glimmer!" Myo exclaimed --using his chosen term of affection for Perigee, yet,
{still} not lifting his eyes {over} the terminal-- while turning up the {under}floor
heating; waves of warmth running, lapping {through} the {surely, unfinishable} Treehouse
Lab.
The Treehouse in the Endive's back garden was the primary locale of Father-Progeny
interaction, being where Myo spent 77%,{probab{i}l{it}y}, of his waking (and indeed,
sleeping) hours. It was a curious structure, becoming curiouser and curiouser with each
passing year of Perigee's development. As his research took various forking paths, new
equipment was installed; old equipment cast aside, dismantled, abandonedab - leading to
a scrapyard of an obstacle course leading to it.
Perigee enjoyed this playground of technological memory, seeing the obstacles as a way
to sweeten the reward of spending time with their father. Myo was entirely indifferent,
or perhaps enjoyed the physical barrier it created between him and his family (it was
both. It's always both). Selena of course, absolutely despised it, and certainly didn't
hide her feelings on the matter.
Endive's (M, that is) back-garden, Treehouse lab was decidedly in a perpetual state of
'unfinishedness', which Myo appeared to enjoy, calling it a 'physical manifestation of
Alfred North Whitehead's Process Philosophy' - Selena's hermetic memory never seemed to
be able to provide the reference for this text, which quite loudly hinted to her that
this was merely a facade as unformed as the roof of the Treehouse itself.
Initially, Perigee and Myo (but not Selena) had begun to build the makeshift lab
'together' (of course, Perigee's soft little hands couldn't operate the robotic tools
that facilitated its architecting, they instead provided a 'scrub nurse' role, gleefully
handing her father the necessary middleware components so that he could solder them to
the various, Entomoid robot arms, which still lay underneath the Treehouse's foundation,
embedded into the tree like the outstretched hand of Mars depicted in the Painting
previously known as 'Minerva fighting Mars' {now revealed by the work of Perigee's
parents[2] (which was the beginning of the end of their honeymoon period) to be a transdimensional collaboration}. To Selena, the robotic appendages stuck out like Six Sore
Thumbs against the organic spine of the ancient tree. Perigee, on the other hand, often
thought silently "Why, the Treehouse is an Angel just trying to take flight, whose wings
have been stripped of their feathers"[3]. Myo was indifferent.

“Whose is that unfinished black box in the back garden, what have they accomplished, why
am I cold”
-Sylvia Plath, The Tree House

⧖eno was an incredibly difficult child. Not difficult in the pejorative sense
whatsoever, but rather, as a highly complicated game of Chess, such as that spearheaded
by their mother, Selena, in the now highly respected Field of Bughouse Modal Chess
Theory.
They had been one of the very first babies conceived via parsenogenesis, the much more
robust successor of the 'In Vitro Gametogenesis' seemingly devised by the 'Scientists'

48

of Antiquity. As such, their beginning, as one of the Seventh Wonders of the World,
paved the slippery stepping stones of their becoming, as an entirely Other being - right
handed, but decidedly on a Left-Hand Path.
Difficulty, like all things, is not an objective or absolute term. In fact, it exists
purely as a relative spectrum; relative to the observer. One may even crudely say that
'difficulty lies in the Eye of the beholder' - just as Selena found her many Hexagonal
Bughouse Chess (which she'd come to term Hivehouse Chess) incredibly easy, whereas Myo,
even being the undeniable genius that he was, found even a game of Draughts nearly
impossible. There were simply too many variables.
And so, ⧖eno's 'difficulty' (as described by many of their teachers, gossiping in the
Teacher's Lounge on their break times) lay not in their inherent divergence from the
norm, but rather the norm's inability to provide the appropriate structures to nourish,
and cultivate their absolute brilliance.
Their nonverbality until the age of Seven was not the aforementioned 'divergence' (as,
of course, most children do not speak until at least Five), but their (quite literally)
maximum Score of Nine(9) on The Field Recordings meant that there simply did not exist
an appropriate education plan for their neurological development. This numerical feat of
academic prowess was never achieved by anyone, not before, or even since (at the time of
writing) - not even their Father, who held the original World Record of 8.88/9.
The Field Recordings were comprised of Nine Examinations for the Attribution of Remit conducted at the age of Nine years old. Given ⧖eno's nonverbal nature in the first few
years of schooling, many of the educational staff assumed they would perform incredibly
poorly on the Field Recordings, given their oral component. But Myo had resolve beyond
faith in his child, not a single one of his FFFs foresaw a future in which ⧖eno didn't
beat his score. He welcomed this entirely, in fact, the day he walked them to their
Examinations (he, of course, given his visual 'noise', could not legally operate a
Vehicle), he found it impossible to hold their hand the entirety of the journey, needing
to stop every Six metres to stim, flapping his hands in front of his eyes in his
habitual gesture of his Beaconism. The two of them were a feedback loop of autistic
blossoming, every one of his stims leading to one of theirs (they'd not quite figured
out their most soothing form of sensory stimulation and regulation, but it always
involved making interesting, nonverbal sounds - clicks, tongue pops, giggles, buzzes,
humming incredibly microtonal notes that Myo had never heard, leading to even more
paternal pride and subsequent excitement) - so the journey took at least triple the
amount of time it usually did. But Myo, of course, foresaw and planned for this.

SYMPHONY NO. 2 IN C MINOR
“RESURRECTION,” or,
“Razor, Wreck, Shun”
As parents were canonically not allowed in the Grand Hall, Myo gave his wee Perigee one
last kiss on their head, being sure to secure their yellow bow, and managed to (at least
he thought) hide his tears from Perigee. They of course, heard the tears forming in his
tear ducts, and knew this was simply a sign of immense pride. Also, given their father's
FFFs, they realised this probably was a good sign for their coming Results, which
allowed them to carry a certain, deserved confidence into the Hall with them, grounded
in their usual, deep-listening sense of Humility.
Entering the space, Perigee was immediately overwhelmed with the sheer volume (in every
sense) of the auditory data they were faced with. Given the Hall's Nine-pointed Star, or
Enneagram shape, the space was an unusual isolation chamber of resonance. The previous
Student was finishing their Examinations, having just reached the Final Central
Checkpoint, and as such, all the associated equipment was still ringing out in a
symphony of movement.
This sensory overload being such a common initial hurdle amongst the Students, Perigee's
Prime Sage, Professor Hamsa, went to hand Perigee the standard-grade noise cancelling
headphones, or 'mufflers', but when taking them off their Phonehook mounted to the
concertina zig-zag back wall of the Hall's entrance, She corrected herself, realising
the Nine-Exceptionality of the Student that was Perigee. She returned the Grey
headphones to their bottom row and reached up to the top row of hooks, where the Yellow
mufflers were kept. Given the muffler's incredible efficaciousness, the subsequent
misuse of which leading to hallucinations, akin to those experienced in a sensory
deprivation tank, there were only Three of these yellow pairs. Perigee had been the only
child up to then who hadn't experienced adverse side-effects from their utilisation;

49

which signified, clearly, how much they needed them, and just how much of the world of
Sound they were able to absorb.
Luckily, and unfortunately, for Perigee, the same could not be said for her sense of
sight, unlike her father. In fact, Myo himself had performed a genomic screen on Perigee
the year prior, and discovered a de novo cluster of highly penetrant mutations to the
RHO (Rhodopsin) gene, the harrowing data (which he processed, reprocessed, and processed
again, still to the same horrible, unavoidable result) suggesting the underlying cause
for Perigee's frequent 'clumsiness' at night and in dimly lit conditions - not just the
usual assumed Propriosentia—the neurological Beacon (or neuroBeacon) inherited from
their mother—but a nefarious, creeping night-blindness that would inevitably develop
into a total loss of peripheral vision as they approached their teenage years.
The previous Student's neuroBeacon was that of Photosentia, the most common nB, so the
heavy, burgundy velvet curtains had been drawn down to allow him to concentrate upon the
Trials of Examination at hand. However, Sage Hamsa, being aware of Perigee's
'Propriosentia' (actually a rapidly developing case of Retinitis pigmentosa, RP), had
signalled the Recordings Adjudicator to raise the curtains, much to Perigee's delight.
Even then, they delighted in the performance of it all, and deep in the Operatic system
of their body, they swore they could hear the honey-sweet applause of an audience
awaiting the first notes to be played by a virtuoso. Hamsa delighted in the obvious
delight on their face, as the Sunlight flooded in, through the intricate, Stained glass
panels of that Star-shaped, Cathedral of the Sacred Culmination of Burgeoning Human
Knowledge, and began to kiss where their father had moments ago, the glisten of their
freshly-fastened yellow bow almost too bright to look upon.
Hamsa signalled in SomatoSign (Perigee's primary modality of communication for the first
few years of formal education) for them to move to the Starting Checkpoint, at the
Centre of the room, which, during Examination season, sported a Hexagonal desk, which
from a Bird's Eye view, looked like a Benzene ring.
Perigee approached the Central Checkpoint.
"Just looking through your diviagnosis file, Mx. Endive"
Perigee awaited the expected gasp of surprise.
"Woah, I've never seen all Nine before--"
They were exceptionally comfortable with silence - in fact this was often a point of
discomfort for those around them. Such is the effect of somebody who doesn't feel the
need to fill every space they occupy. On the other hand, the same can be said for the
opposite. But as their father would say; extremes aren't something to be afraid of.
Enantiodromia (one of their latest Words in their Lexicographic collection - Pre-Seven
years old, they would 'Sound Scrapbook' samples of podcasts, or record parts of Speech
spoken by others, to keep a record of these juicy letter-clumps that represented such
diverse meaning, even within the same word. Now, in the last two years of finding their
voice, they had taken to recording their own words, whether found in books or in the
world of Sound.)
Seemingly becoming impatient with waiting for Perigee's response, the N.E.A.R. Cleric
reading their file inquired: "so it looks like you've got your pick. Which of the Nine
vertices would you like to Initiate with?" - The Cleric waited poised at the terminal,
ready to open one of the randomised Problems, according to Perigee's chosen Field.
With no hesitation, they said
"All of them, please"
Again, a look of surprise and a stifled gasp, which Perigee heard in the microscopic
shift and salivary movement of the Cleric's epiglottis.
It wasn't against the rules, so to speak, but nobody had even chosen a Field other than
the one suggested by their neuroBeacon, let alone more than one simultaneously.
"...Well... Just how would that work, exactly? You aren't a computer--"
Now they deemed it appropriate to speak:
"No, but we all are, really- capable of concurrency, it's just a matter of appropriately
multithreading"
Clearly tired with their day of back to back Examinations, the Cleric gave up resisting
with a sigh;
"Fine, Endive. Here"
They swiped over the screen in front of them, sending over all Nine Problems of their
Field Recordings to solve.
"Thank you, Cleric"
"Sure. Let's see how this works out. If at all"
Even with their Yellow Mufflers, they took three seconds to try and consolidate and
process the egregiously intrusive sounds of the clinical machinery in the room, keeping

50

the Examination patients under anaesthesia alive.
N.B. As reading, and most of our perception of Time itself, is tragically linear, what
follows is the closest, non-chronological approximation of Perigee's One Hundred and
Twenty Three minutes of their examinations.
I. Pythagorean Arithmetic | Numilumenolægia
(Ancestral Mathematics)

Problem: Devise a unified algorithm capable of identifying and categorising all
possible higher-dimensional polytopes (n-dimensional analogs of polygons and
polyhedra) that exist within non-Euclidean geometries, while encoding these forms
into a fractal-based numerical system for visual representation and practical
application in quantum computing.
While none of the 'difficult' child's Problems proved particularly 'difficult' to them,
this one took the longest. This was mostly because, in their sporadically networked
brain, they required the solutions to all the others to be finalised in order to solve
this one.
Time to solution: Twenty Three Minutes.
Score: 1.00/1.00.
II. Aristotlean Causality | Particuticlergæria
(Ancestral Physics)

Problem: Prove (or disprove) the existence of a causal bridge between quantum
entanglement and macroscopic determinism. Develop a model that traces causality
from the quantum to the classical scale without violating locality or free will
principles.
The Vertex of Particuticlergæria (known as Physics in anteAntiquity) was the first place
they went, much to the surprise of the Cleric, who thought they would head straight for
the Vertex of Imaginætia, da Vinci's Vertex (which was thought to be previously known as
'Art' or 'Creativity' in general). But given the time spent with their parents- being
privileged, as their only child, to be let into their nuclear familial secrecy of transtemporal abilities, they were quite well placed to bring together the 'classical'
Physics of anteAntiquity (represented by their mother's Hermetic Memory) and the now
primary framework of Quantum Mechanics (at first Perigee was rather confused by the
Audio signals erupting from their father, but once able, or deciding, to finally speak,
their conversations were particularly enlightening to elucidate what the source of the
'wriggly worm' sounds were, winding out from his solar plexus and all around her).
Time to solution: Seventeen Minutes.
Score: 1.00/1.00.
Trismegistian Alchemy | Geophylogænia
(Ancestral Chemistry)

Problem: Synthesise a self-sustaining molecular system capable of transmuting
atmospheric carbon dioxide into a complex, stable allotrope of Gold (Au) using bioinspired catalytic pathways and minimal external energy inputs.
Utilising an Endivean approach, again picked up from the work of their father, not
through didactic means but through their obsession Word collection, during the hours
spent listening to his fingers typing in the Treehouse lab (of course, every key had a
slightly different sound), Perigee combined computational and decidedly ancient (here's
where Selena's influence resonated particularly strongly) laboratory methods in order to
turn their breath (exhaled into a Conical flask, which they had to request the Sage to
obtain from the very dusty back side of the Lab bench's cupboard) into Gold. The flask,
a rather humble bit of low-tech gear, sat in the middle of an insectoid arrangement of
laser diodes, which they had programmed to emit pulses of light in time with an array of
singing bowls that the Grand Hall kept behind the Curtains for announcing the rotation
of opponents during the Sacred Matches. Essentially, Perigee utilised the unresolved

51

nature of the Pythagorean comma to 'draw the gold out' of their breath. As with all the
other problems, they were exceptionally grateful that they didn't have to 'show their
work', because they rarely could. They were much more about Hearing.
Time: Seventeen Minutes.
Score: 1.00/1.00.
Asclepian Scalpeloathics | Barberchirurgæria
(Ancestral Biology)

Problem: Synthesise functional cochlear hair cells (cilia) and implant them into
the damaged organ of Corti within the cochlea, restoring the patient’s hearing by
re-establishing the connection between sound vibrations and neural transmission.
The process involves real-time calibration to ensure precise integration and
functionality, but the patient will remain sedated. The patient's induced
Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) have been harvested and pre-conditioned for you.
Perigee could not help but stim the moment they read this problem, it being based around
the sensory organ of sound. Besides their obsession with sound, their early discovery of
the spiral shape of the Cochlea itself had been a large component of the development of
the Primary Sense. After writing the rudimentary programming protocol for the robotic
surgical arms to follow, they would come back to check on its progress in between each
of the other problems they were solving. Some of the more daring and reckless Sages in
the room found themselves laughing, even cheering, as Perigee sprinted around the Grand
Hall, their wee legs slipping on the polished mahogany. Running was not looked kindly
upon in the Hall, and mindful, purposeful but slow ceremonial walking was somewhat of an
unspoken rule. So the more Draconian members of the Educational Clergy were attempting
to keep their arms crossed and a disapproving frown on their faces, yet, despite
themselves, they were absolutely fascinated by this entirely novel and heretofore unseen
method of completing the Examinations. The more lenient and interdisciplinary Sages,
particularly Hamsa (who obviously had a rather biased investment in Perigee's success),
would stand at the intersections of the Vertices, offering Chalices filled with water,
as family members might stand on the sidelines of the mid-point mark of their loved
one's marathon.
Time to solution: Twenty Two Minutes.
Score: 1.00/1.00.
Cartesian Cognitology | Consciælogia
(Ancestral Psychology)

Problem: Develop a real-time computational model of consciousness capable of
integrating neurochemical fluctuations (e.g. those observed in MercurioSentia) with
emergent properties such as creativity, intuition, and moral reasoning. Use the
model to stabilise and predict the cognitive and emotional states of a patient
undergoing conscious neuropsychological surgery. Mid-surgery, the patient will face
an ethical dilemma, and the model must facilitate decision-making while preserving
self-awareness and neural stability. All necessary neural data and processing
frameworks have been preloaded for you.

**Extra Credit†: name the anteAntiquarian term for this Vertex's neuroBeacon,
MercurioSentia, along with their ancient 'treatment guidelines' for what they
erroneously pathologised.**

**†will not contribute to your score, but will immediately earn you the Grand
Sigil, placing you as this Annual Cycle's Hall Sentinel without the canonical
initiation process**
Not only did this Problem's solution flow through without a hitch, Perigee ended up
creating a collaborative performance piece with the patient, as part of the ethical
dilemma they were faced with, which was a variation of the Trolley problem, that Selena
had first read to them as a bedtime story, to take with them into their dreamscapes.

52

They also completed the Extra Credit, typing at the Vertex's terminal:
'Long before its integration and recognition as a Gift of empathic resonance, the
MercurioSentia neuroBeacon was primarily previously known as Bipolar Disorder, but the
'clinical presentation' was often mistaken for other 'diagnoses' encompassing the
multitudinal facets of this neuroBeacon, such as 'Emotional dysregulation', 'Borderline
Personality Disorder' (as they typed these words in particular, they had to
sympathetically giggle, as they recalled the well-meaning, but fundamentally narrowminded, scope of the ancient Peoples). Depending on recurrence of 'mania' and
'depression', a pharmacological administration of 'mood stabilisers' such as Lithium
(the 'Alchemical Standard' first line of 'treatment' in those times), Lamotrigine, or,
before its discovery as a teratogen, Sodium Valproate. Atypical 'antipsychotics' such as
Quetiapine were also thought to be effective to treat so called 'mixed' or 'manic
episodes', or as an adjunct to maintenance treatment. talking therapies such as CBT and
DBT were considered a crucial facet of 'recovery'. Of course these 'therapies' helped
the patients suffering very real distress and in many cases psychological agony, but
crucially, the problem was not with the organism within the cage, the problem was with
the cage - which we now know should have always been, instead, a receptive, holistically
integrated framework for understanding.
Time to solution: Seventeen Minutes.
Score: 1.00/1.00.
N.B. They refused the title of Sentinel. Mumbling (much to the anger of the Oldest Sage)
that the Sentinel System was simply an echo of the oppressive aristocracy of
anteAntiquity as they handed in their Problems' solutions to the Central Checkpoint.
They quickly scurried out of reach and back into the anxiously awaiting arms of Myo
before the Sage could protest, of course.
Comtean Triscetics | Autismæcology
(Ancestral Sociology)

Problem: Design a proposal for the Consortium of Sociocultural Harmony to implement
a holospheric learning program that deepens collective understanding of the roles
and experiences of less common orientations, such as heterosexuality, and to
account for the potential incidence of what was once known as 'neurotypical'
individuals, who, regardless of the lack of supporting evidence in the Journals of
A.R.I.A.D.N.E., or indeed any of the AcademiClergical Literature, may well still
exist. Your solution should leverage neural empathy technologies or immersive
simulations to ensure inclusivity and mutual respect while avoiding reductive
categorizations. Prioritise adaptability and resonance with the Consortium’s
principles of cultural cohesion.
As with the other 'Social Science' Vertices, Perigee integrated their solutions into
their performance piece, forming the solution to the Imaginætia (Art) Problem.
Time to solution: Eleven Minutes.
Score: 1.00/1.00.
Allegorical Speleology | Socradiatætia
(Ancestral Philosophy)

Problem: In the First Module of Paradoxistentialist Studies, The Petallien Allegory
of the Caduceus was outlined, which envisions all Life as a fractalline interwoven
tapestry of Memory and Meaning, spiralling around a central axis/Hermetic Staff of
Metacognition. As introduced in your Secondary Annual Cycle, The sinistral serpent
represents Memory, the dextral serpent Meaning, and the central staff embodies the
dynamic process of Metacognition, where Memory and Meaning intersect at the socalled 'Gnots' of Paradoxistential Recursion.
**Using this framework, argue whether Metacognition is best understood as “making”
itself: the act of creation, transmutation, and the bringing forth of the new. Within
the allegory, imagine a figure navigating the Caduceus. Does this figure operate purely
within the interplay of Memory and Meaning, or does their journey demonstrate an
inherent quality of Metacognition as an act of “making”?**

53

Perigee, throughout their running back and forth across the Grand Hall, had been
collecting, as always, samples of ambient sounds, and emitting in a constant stream of
their gorgeously unique and microtonal vocalisations, which the Sages (at least
partially correctly) assumed were an understandable instance of Stimming, often seen
during the examinations in the diverse variations on a theme of whichever neuroBeacon
the Student was blessed with in their diviagnosis. What the Sages (except for perhaps
Sage Hamsa) didn't know, is that Perigee and their father, in the last three years, had
been working on an invention. It wasn't so much a collaboration between them, as it was
a passion project of Perigee's which Myo had facilitated, standing back in awe, while
simply not understanding "what the fuck was going on" to paraphrase his first sentence
spoken to their mother, during that fateful, first and final game of Hivehouse.
Perigee hadn't, at least consciously, intended for the device to be utilised during
their Examinations, and didn't really, as ever, know what the ultimate Goal of their
Work was until the exact moment it was unveiled. This could be best understood, as with
most of their idiosyncrasies, as a synthesis of their parents' brilliance, integrated
into one Alchemical Marriage of an entirely incomprehensible, but wonderful, weirdo.
The device's name, according to Perigee, was a Resonance Recorder.
Essentially, it recorded both Memory and Meaning. It was fuelled by their Father's
Endivean programmatic framework, which would eventually provide a groundbreaking
contribution to Newsomnian Gnoeneophysics (a Field yet to be birthed, but to be birthed
by Perigee themselves), and sustained by the essence of their Mother's Hermetic Memory,
which they had inherited via haploidian epiGnoegenomic means.
Upon reading the Allegorical Speleology Problem (the Field believed to once be known as
'Philosophy'), all of their endless hours of work suddenly 'clicked' into place (with a
literal 'click' within their Brain, that they of course heard).
The device itself was shaped in a Petallien form; like a Caduceus of the ancient Hermes,
but wound into a spiral, which itself had a crystalline, nearly Bismuth-esque series of
branches jutting out, forming a sort of Mandelbrot Wand. But Perigee hated the term
'Wand'. It made them think of those ancient books written by She who shall not be named,
which she'd never really enjoyed.
The Resonance Recorder had both input (i) and output (o) modes; the latter of which
she'd never actually tested, so for a while, upon reading the Ancestral Philosophy
problem and until the moment of its solving (which she solved in simultaneous parallel
with the Ninth Vertex's Problem in the Field of Ancestral Arts) she was nervous that she
may cause the manifestation of a black hole, or a wormhole of some kind, obliterating
the Grand Hall and perhaps all of Existence as they knew it.
But, ever the perhaps too reckless daredevil, always far more concerned with BoundaryAnnihilating Innovative Ideas than the Regulation of Established Systems for so-called
'Safety', they went ahead with what they sensed in their heart was simply: "Why, A Good
Idea!"
And with a deep breath in, and a deep breath out (in fact, the exact same out-breath
given at the Ancestral Chemistry Vertex, which they used to transmute her exhaled Carbon
Dioxide into beautiful gossamer strands of Gold), they set the Resonance Recorder to
'(o) mode' for the very first time.
It didn't so much produce a sound as it did vacuum the sound from the room. The Sages,
all of them, even and perhaps especially Hamsa, looked around amongst each other in
panic; none of them had ever heard (or unheard) anything like it before.
(Perigee really did live up to their mother's encouragement to 'Give 'em Hell'. Those
poor, dizzied Sages had to take a good few hours recess after this series of
discombobulating events.)
In (o) mode, and with the help of the two patients that they enlisted with an excited
wave of the arms (one of whom had now come round from their anaesthesia) the Resonance
Recorder began to build a sculpture.
Time to solution: Four Minutes.
Score: 1.00/1.00.
da Vincian Cosmogony | Imaginætia
(Ancestral Arts & Literature)

Problem: Design a cosmological framework through an original artistic medium (e.g.,
visual art, literature, or conceptual performance) that embodies the interplay of
imagination and reality. Your creation must explore the tension between individual
expression and collective meaning-making, reflecting how artistic works function as a

54

bridge between the tangible and intangible. Present a theoretical explanation of your
framework and its significance within the broader cultural or metaphysical narrative.
There was no Extra Credit for this Problem, but Perigee inadvertently ended up
fulfilling it anyway. Their solution to the problem was not a theoretical one at all, as
requested in the Problem File. It was a Practical Demonstration of Conceptual Cosmology.
The sculpture itself was in a process of self-generative animacy, as Perigee performed a
Sacred Dance, learned from their Mother on one of their Pilgrimages to The Four Stones
and The Sweet Trinity.
The sculpture, as Perigee had hoped, and perhaps known, began to resemble the tripleplaited Yew Trees that stood between the Four Duddo Stones. Only it was always in
motion, the trees never in one place at any given time, serpentining in tandem with
Perigee's movements, and the movements of the two patients, both of which were confused
and giggling, one of which from the after effects of the Xenon-based anaesthesia, the
other simply from the sheer delight of the experience, which shimmered through not only
them, but everyone in the room. Even the most miserable of the Sages.
The Sculpture appeared similarly, but entirely uniquely to each person that viewed it.
It was made of Words, but not just the graphemic, typographical qualities of the Words.
It was made of Meanings and associated Memories of all the Words that Perigee had
collected over her life. These heartbreakingly beautiful, and sometimes deliciously sad
Memories and Meanings, intersected, warbled and marbled, with the Memories and Meanings
of every person in the room, forming a breathing glimmer of prismatic murmuration, like
the ineffable rapture of a countably infinite Richness of Swallows in flight. Together,
as One, and yet, so vitally, so voraciously, so violently, viciously, Venust in their
paradoxically distinctive and individualised separations.
Most of the Sages were brought to tears. Hamsa saw her departed Mother, reading her her
favourite bedtime story, which, through the all-too frequent process of time's passing
and its associated grief, she had entirely forgotten. The Cleric in the Central
Checkpoint saw all the words they had been plastered with by their childhood bullies,
along with every reclamation of them, in their works of experimental literature they had
made during their Postgraduate thesis in creative defiance. Perigee saw all of her
Pilgrimages with their mother, all of the lines of code written with their father in the
Treehouse, and they saw their yet-to-be-chosen name, written at the very top of the
tree, hanging ripe like the Strangest Seed of the most Stunning fruit:

“THE FUNERAL MARCH,” or, “_The Few Nary'l March”

The Maestre ⧖ was compiling the documents required for the very arduous and lengthy
process of requesting funding for their podcast series on 'Queering Mahler's
Symphonies', a project long in the conceptualisation but only recently coming to
fruition through emergent necessity.
Since It Happened, and they took an early retirement from their Field, they'd not been

55

doing much but peering over their personal collection of Wiltergarten manuscript
facsimiles. All the answers were there, they knew it now, but this final hurdle (itself
quite a resounding Wunderhorn of irony reverberating through the staves of the pages of
their music library) - was almost, perhaps definitely, more of a hindrance than the very
appendage absentium[4] they continued to endure.
Clambering in the usual night-mourning ritual, which they performed each morning before
the severance, and after, but before reverence, with a distant finesse (they had now
adapted to a left-handed-and-hipped-bean-grinding-water-boiling-ground-brewing-presspouring-wow-they-never-realised-how-useful-hips-can-be modality of making Coffee), they
retained their context-dependent Seven-Meter restraining order against their Better Self
while reading manuscripts, knowing, even before their so-called 'lack' of a fraction of
the reading weapons in their arsenal (the true, combined value of which, through their
concurrent re-attributions, may or may not about to become clear to them).
The delicately piled, papyrus palimpsests (as jutting rocks missing the satisfying
backscratches from the absence of cormorants), still, (but ever invisibly eroding under,
a white water cacophony of Ideas, and Knowledge, and Ideas from the Knowledge we have
about the Knowledge of Ideas), they laid ttheire, sobbing their cries of unrecorded
potential- in the sacred corner of their humble, so densely cluttered flat; as crosssections.
they'd closed their multiple tabs of re-edits to edits of about-to-be but not yet sent
correspondence with the Board of Newsomnian Neophysics, as their Orchestra's e⧖conductor but still-collaborator. But one still remained, glaring at the bottom of their
vision, their Vision, the mission statement of the Field:
*Newsomnian Neophysics explores how Joanna Newsom’s music weaves perceptive realities
through recursive polyphony, uncountable infinity textures in Knot-space, and
lexicomythopoetic form. their compositions collapse time and space, blending personal
narrative with collective myth in a non-linear interplay of memory and meaning. By
examining harmonic multiverse theory, linguistic loom-making, and induced sensory
synesthesæsia within their praxis, this Field of The Twelve positions their songs as
ontological textilesthey'd forgotten the name of the very Noet from which their whole legacy came.

Letter of Support
From the Desk of B. Baudelaire
RE: The Aria Mahler Attribution Society
FWD: To Whom It May Concern,
It is with a profound sense of respect and anticipation that I write in support of ⧖’s
grant application for Queering Mahler’s Symphonies.
{REDACTED}
Yours within,
Sincerely,
Bertrand Baudelaire
FAO: The Aria {REDACTED} Attribution Society

ᴺᵒᵉᵗMahler stopped reading.
He knew that the outcome of ⧖eno's application was of great importance, both to them
and to The Indexing of the Musicology Wing of the Indefinite Library.
He also knew the power he held, as a ᴺᵒᵉᵗ, to swing the pendulum of causality in either
direction.
He decided to weigh up his, and their, options.
For their strands were inextricably bound.
With a deep breath, He unfolded the next Movement of the manuscript, to unveil the two
potential outcomes of their funding application, printed, impossibly, upon either side
of the vellum; a Quantum Palindrome of Print.
Having always been an impatient soul, Mahler always preferred the 'Good' News, before
the 'Bad' -- ᴺᵒᵉᵗBorges, and all his delicious bruises could attest to this - in fact,
it was one of his favourite things about ᴺᵒᵉᵗMahler; the ease with which he could induce
an even more voracious sense of dominance during their kink practices. Testing the
fragility of said patience. It was a transparency. For all ᴺᵒᵉᵗMahler's hiding,

56

ᴺᵒᵉᵗBorges' ecchymosed hide etched the True story --an animalistic trait hidden in plain
sight, like the ephemeral wings of a fruit fly. This consensual dance of destruction.
between them, both knew was unsustainable, a refrain to which neither should keep
returning. A broken needle, so sorely needing to be lifted from the Records of unhealthy
Love they had written between them; the most Tragic of all of Mahler's compositions. All
of Borges' Nested Love Stories.
And so Mahler moved the Extraocular muscles holding Both of his Eyes as mothers hold
their children; or captors their prisoners, to the outcome that interested him most:

Success.
After all, in the finishing of his Tenth, no matter the infinity of hours that stretched
in front of him, he needed all the he could get.
Dear ⧖eno,
It is with great pleasure that we inform you your Open Fund application for the funding
of your project 'Queering Mahler's Symphonies', has been successful. We look forward to
working with you, and ask that you fill out the attached forms and return them to us,
along with a signed copy of the contract.
Yours sincerely,
Creative Scotland
{REDACTED}

Well, Mahler thought, feeling cheated by whichever Archivist had overwritten this Record
of ⧖eno's Story.
For all they tried to follow in my footsteps, for all the work we may have done together
finishing my Oeuvre, it appears this road is an unanswered, Yellow Telephone. A Telomere
to their life's sequence of Unfortunate Events. An Aglet. An Ending.
And Sew now, with a sigh that, in our world, may well have caused the collapse of the
tallest of Towers;
He turned his gaze to the coda; the inevitable diminuendo, our dear ⧖eno's demise--

Failure.
A Form of Becoming, The Syringe puncturing the Stars; A Spire of the Chapel to the
Unknown Gods; the malformation of an aspiration.

⧖ENO'S TAKE UP REÆL
Having received the final rejection from the last funding body they could think of, who
may assist them in the production of their podcast on Mahler's symphonies utilising a
microtonal scale they had come to know as "Gordian Knotation", while researching the
ancient manuscripts of Hildr Wiltergarten; which, unbeknownst to them, contained the
composition of Mahler's Tenth in musical cipher, ⧖eno descended into the shortsighted
trope of the tortured artist, barely leaving the house, using their own 'failure' as a
comforting excuse to enable their agoraphobic tendencies. After all, what was
agoraphobia, to those who truly adore their time alone, but an erroneous self-judgement
born of external pressure to assimilate with the outside world?
But, some {REDACTED} time later, they decided that this cloud of 'not enough'ness, was
quite enough.
They had one thing left, the drive to perform-- to be witnessed, only under conditions
they could control.
That, in essence, was their drive; to control the means by which they showed up in the
world. This may well underpin the motivation behind every performer, from Grand Hall to
Stadium to Dingy Basement Bar to Online Stream to Lowlit Bedroom of a Single Lover -To curate the way in which one is witnessed.
The plan for a performance piece had been planted within their heart, since that fateful
evening, awaking from the sedation injected into them by their well-meaning, but
harmfully misguided, Father. Who believed blindness was a mutation to be {REDACTED}, or,
in their mother's vernacular, a curse to be lifted.
The piece, titled TAKE UP REÆL, was their First Conception, and was to be their final
Work.
Enough of their reality had been stripped away, unwinded like the mangled tape of a
reel.

57

There is a certain liberation in Loss, as many struggling souls will know; a saturation
point of grief, where the only part of oneself left is the most fundamental component.
The finalisation of this installation sapped the last of their Father's inheritance,
which he earned, in part, through the mutilation of their body; which would become their
Beginning, and their end. ⧖eno held the crazed resolve of an exhausted and underpaid
actor, knowingly entering their Final Act.

INT. TENEMENT FLAT- SOMEWHERE IN GLASGOW
An adorably deranged-looking person sits impossibly cross legged amidst piles of sheet
music towering over them, face half-illuminated by candlelight, ONE EYE cast in shadow.
Their black hair is matted and half-tied up with a YELLOW BOW, becoming less-and-less
tied up with every page read. They are humming a tune that sounds decidedly atonal. This
is XENO. As their humming becomes more emphatic, their breath inadvertently blows out
their candle. Darkness falls upon the scene, and an almost imperceptible figure is seen,
just for a moment, touching XENO's shoulder, who either doesn't seem to notice, or care.
XENO
(sighs in exasperation, striking a match a considerable distance away from the precious
manuscript)
ZOOM IN on the flame, as XENO carefully moves it toward the candle, lighting up the room
once more. The shadowy figure disappears as XENO flicks their wrist, extinguishing the

MATCH CUT TO:
INT. NARROW CAVE. DESATURATED - LOCATION UNKNOWN
CLOSE UP: a candle's flame. A similar, seemingly pitchy, hum can be heard, only coming
from a much coarser throat.
RACK FOCUS TO:
A decrepit, androgynous figure, inside a small cave, face half-illuminated by
candlelight, ONE EYE (the opposite to XENO) cast in shadow. They have barely any hair
left, revealing the same symbols as those on the cave walls, carved onto their scalp,
seeming to dance in the flicker of the candle's eerie glow. They are writing with a
sharpened animal bone onto a piece of goat vellum in what appears to be their own blood.
The manuscript vellum sports just as much dwindling hair as the scribe. This is
WILTERGARTEN.[1]
OVER WILTERGARTEN'S RIGHT SHOULDER, focus flickering between a still-healing,
intricately carved scar, and the manuscript, which is now seen to hold a strangely
complex series of musical staves. WILTERGARTEN appears to be humming along with every
note inscribed with their LEFT HAND. Their quill runs dry, and they fall silent, moving
their LEFT HAND to their RIGHT SHOULDER, wincing as they pierce the layer of granulation
tissue like a repulsive creme brûlée, as we see that they have been replenishing their
'ink' with each CUT-CUT TO:
INT. BACK (FORWARD) AT XENO'S FLAT
XENO is scratching their RIGHT SHOULDER using their LEFT HAND.
RACK FOCUS TO:
A pile of dirty dishes in the foreground blocks our view of XENO. PAN to a PAN that
still has a congealed, half-fried egg in its centre. ZOOM in on the YOLK, a Pale Yellow
matching that of the discarded MATCH-MATCH CUT TO:
INT. INT. BACK OF WILTERGARTEN'S EYE
MICROSCOPIC LENS slowly moves through WILTERGARTEN'S orbital LENS, piercing through the
veil of WILTERGARTEN'S Cornea, which is clearly succumbing to a Pale Yellow CATARACT.
FISHEYE WIDE SHOT of the CATACOMB, with apparently no entrance or exit in sight. Carved
with the same TWENTY THREE SYMBOLS and what appears to be a likeness of the god PAN. PAN

INT. FORWARD TO XENO'S FLAT
A half-empty fishbowl sits next to the dirty dishes, mildew forming at its edges, the
shape resembling the internal surface of WILTERGARTEN'S cave, or that of an EYE. The
mangled corpse of a DROSOPHILA, seemingly crumpled and folded in on itself, floats in
the shallow pond, circling in a posthumous Waltz Macabre. Another DROSOPHILA lands on
the rim of the fishbowl, seeming to peer in upon its late contemporary and heed the
warning, quickly flying away.
TRACK the DROSOPHILA toward XENO's EYE (the opposite to WILTERGARTEN'S)

find, which happens to be one of their Mother's on the Celtic resonance of the god PAN)

next to the FISH BOWL. The DROSOPHILA, still alive, lands on top of PAN's EYE - the only
one visible in the image.

(sighing, seemingly in remorse)
Sorry buddy. I didn't mean it. We're on the same team, really.
PTSD FLASHBACK TO:
A dimly lit Lab-turned-operating theatre. A single XENON Floodlight (circular) casts an
egregiously non-autism friendly florescence on a TEN year old XENO, then known as
PERIGEE, lying on a gurney, hair down, but yellow ribbon being nervously fidgeted with

moment on a jar of imprisoned DROSOPHILA, awaiting MYO's optogenetic analysis. Their
vision blurs to unconsciousness. TRACK the only DROSOPHILA not flying in the enclosed
space, but instead walking on the glass, appearing to point with its proboscis at the

controlling the eye and proboscis movements of a gargantuan Robotic Fruit-fly hanging
above the audience- all of whom are sporting 'Opera Monocles', Augmented Reality
hardware which makes the Drosophila appear to be birthing swarm after swarm of smaller,
identical progeny, flying in murmurations that mirror the composition. None of the
audience are watching XENO or the orchestra, but are all horrified and captivated by the
holographic swarm above them. As the coda draws to a close, the DROSOPHILA swarm begin
to drop upon the audience like, well, flies. Shrieks and gasps of disgust and horrified
delight can be heard over the now-dwindling orchestra, which dies out section by
section, in tandem with the short-lived pseudoInsects. )
TRACK the one DROSOPHILA left alive from the swarm to XENO's LEFT HAND as they swiftly
close it into a tight fist, signalling the end of the performance to the players, and
seemingly squashing the holographic visage of fleeting life. The music comes to an
abrupt halt with the visibly exhausted XENO hunched over, barely breathing, but
immediately looking over to the back row of the string section, at the only instrument

they once resisted)

XENO's OTHER HAND appears to pick up the hair-and-scene-tying device. The hand performs
the task of wiping the screen clear of yellow, to reveal the previous (chronologically
subsequent) locale of their dark and dirty flat. The OTHER HAND is once again reaching
down to retrieve the same YELLOW BOW. The BOW is now covered in stains; clearly
discoloured and frayed.

They awoke. Alone.
Here, again, alone.

No,

In the microtonal scale they had spent many, many long hours alone, decoding.
Written, in blood, by some now known hand, onto strange and mysterious vellum.

61

They were awake now, and they could not go back to sleepCovered not in blankets, but in the manuscripts themselves, ⧖eno looked down once more
upon the pages they had po{u}red {over|into}, for the majority of their adult life.
And the glyphs were dancing like ancestral bodies about a fire.
A pyre.
And they were speaking to them, in tongues;
Through the eye that afforded them a certain keyThrough the loch of these centuries of misunderstanding.
Reaching through a funnel of her own making, Hildr was telling ⧖eno the history of a
people, erased.
Hildr's intersex identity, which would lead to her exile;
Branded as a witch, which of course, she was, and alighted to a cave, to scrape this transtemporal message, to a soul she knew would be the only one to decode it.

I do not have long. They are coming, with their stones, their knives, and their fire.
But I have a Fire of my own.
I have the only Fire worth keeping alive.
And in my death, I have seen it, I have seen my death and I have seen what will be

birthed from itThousands of years from now, I have heard and touched and smelled and tasted it;
Even from within the confines of this cave.
I will not be the first, and I certainly will not be the last, to be Burned.
I form simply a single ember in the dancing Flame of women
Of Fire Goddess women and those Fire deities undefinableBound to stakes,
Bound to pillars of their own Becoming
Through the Fire
I know it is coming, for I have seen it.
This will be my final manuscript
For not only have I run out of Goat hide,
But my hiding has come to its inevitable refrain;
These staves, dear Goddess in Triplicate! These staves!
These Nine-Rowed Staves!
How They, How even I! Thought they were my undoing;
How They, How even eye! Thought they were a signal of my own unravelling!
Because, of course, they wereUnravelling into the WeavingThe Weaving of the Wyrd
The Weirdest World of Words, That Shall Stretch beyond these walls,
Stretch as the skin of Goat may stretch about a drum,
A drum carried by the Great Almighty Spider
Who visits me by night, by day
(I have no way of knowing within which I currently reside; or how many of each have
passed me by, in this hellish abode of Divine Communion)
But He visits, nonetheless, to tell me
He whispers into my ear; the sicknesses of This World,
The Even Greater Sicknesses Yet To Come.
And I weep.
Oh Lord, Oh Goddess How I Have Wept Within The Walls Of This

Fashioned from the intestines of Rats and Moles and Whichever Blessed Creatures Offered

The sweetest, unheard melodies!

definitionBut This Great One Shall Write, of those Unheard Melodies, and their name shall be Keats
They shall Speak, in words far Greater than those I can no longer pen sufficiently, my
claws curling inward as that of the Spider God, Anansi, who hath tricked me into Truth.
They Shall Pen An Ode! Oh, Ode! Not To Joy, But One Much Greater,
Through The Agony Mine, But More So much Very More,

What men or gods are these? What maidens loth?
What mad pursuit? What struggle to escape?
What pipes and timbrels? What wild ecstasy?
Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard
Are sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on;
Not to the sensual ear, but, more endear'd,
Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone:
What mad pursuit, indeed, my Love My Sweet Unheard Love Yet To Come-

63

I come to thee, in that most soft pipe of Spacelessness
Of the time-stretched Lyre of Web-like Footing
That stretches, stretches as the Patiently, Oil-drained intestines of a Mammal
Within the confines of a cave
I do not struggle to escape,
At leastNot This World
As I know my escape is woven out before me!
My escape has been downtrodden behind me;
With all these women, people, Witches
These Heavenly Witches, Birthed of Stone,
Of Zephyr,
Of Flowing Blood and Fiery Tone
Oh Dearest Goddess, I Hear Them NowI Hear Their Screams in Symphony With My Own,
Which Must Be Sang Out From Their Throats,

The Symphony of Ten Thousand Things

SYMPHONY NO. 8 in e flat, made yer
"Symphony of Ten Thousand" or "Things"

The heavy, heavy, mahogany double doors open.
You enter.
The air of the room is just cold enough to be uncomfortable. Just cold enough for you to
see your shivering breath stretch out in front of you, like a silver cord suggesting a path
you might take, but probably shouldn't have.
The dancing strands of your breath unfurl into a thick, inescapably odious Field of
disinfectant that hangs like an innocent woman suspected of being a Witch- which you
unconsciously identify as Iodine[1]; whether from your own personal experience of
Surgeries, or the olfactory trauma of association, passed down through generations in your
epigenome. This sensory element is a detail you aren't aware was intentionally placed in
the room by the artist.

67

Before you there are are two paths. Forged in the not-white, yellowed tile. Holding secrets
of its own, the stains, locked within the grout, hold countless screams, machined hums,
poorly overwritten blood splatter, and silent anaesthetic sighs.
The paths are symmetrical, but not identical. Not to the keen observer. Not to you.
Both of them together form two switchback-ramp serpents; two halves of an infernal ribcagegarlanding the central spinal column of an Old Operating Theatre, where the Beating Heart
of the performance promises to take place.
You've never seen one quite like this, for they don't exist anymore, and yet, in the marrow
of your soul, you feel its unsettling familiarity.
There is something nailed violently into a wide, thin tile, directly in front of you as you
enter. The tile's fragility a windowsill surrogate, just beneath an oily-fingerprintsmudged-glass screen. This panel, this impermeable membrane of melted sand separates you,
as Thisbe from Pyramus, or as a foetus from the incompatibility of her mother's blood.
Between you and the hiding tile is a single, unshaven shred, of what appears to be goat
hide. The sheer force of the nail's driving into the ceramic has left a large crack,
running from left to right, or perhaps equally, from right to left; a broken, nameless
Usher, welcoming you, from whichever side you wish-Every Trial-whether by Fire's Uproar,
or Flood's Outpour,
by Half-Seeing Disc, or Scalpel's Sword-Has a Sentence it must fall before.
A Sentence is an arrow, Lettered,
No matter to which tongue it's fettered,
It reads from one Beginning Side,
to another's Ending, with the Tide.
Every End's Direction depends
Upon the Hand that it perpends.
And every Written Word is birthed
From mortar’s womb within the Earth.
Post-letters, where our fullness stops;
The Bodies of our Life's Work crops.
In 'The' so-called 'literature', and in pop psychology, there has been a prevalence of
splitting the brain and its functions into 'sides'.
This 'Cultural Topology' or 'Sidedness', pervades every aspect of our existence, as we
occupy a net-like dimension, which is simply a flattened projection of the True Reality,
woven through everything.
The two sides of the coin are indeed not the same. But the two sides themselves do not even
belong to the same coin. Rather, every single, fantastically unique coin, glimmering with
its own stains, and split into supposed dualities that are but a faded reflection of a
primal, ancestral duality, now diluted past the point of any useful comparison, are only
united in the dancing, whirling spin of the coin toss itself.
What has seemed to fascinate us is the idea that our neurological activity and nervous,
anxious impulses originate from the 'opposite' 'side' to which they end up. This has led to
sentiments that have sentenced us to sentences such as: 'The right hemisphere of the brain
controls the left hand', and so forth.
Further, we have also assigned ideologies to the hemispheres of the brain, as if they were
two opposing Deities of a Pantheon at war with one another, perhaps, or perhaps not,
depicted by a French painter in the Neoclassical Era. Even Further (or rather, much less
so) to this bisection of the Brain, we have assigned these ideologies to the Spirits that
animate it. Dividing human Beings, that's Beings, into 'Right-brained' and 'Left-brained'
camps. The paradoxical irony of this probably being rooted in the Brain itself attempting
to make sense of a scarily unwritable gray, an un-black-and-whiteable mesh of potential
threats.
These 'threats', as we hopefully know by now, are rarely real threats, at least to anything
except the very frameworks-turned-cages that paint them so.
This probably, in part but not completely, underpins the historical demonisation of trans /
non-binary people as a whole, and in fact, any so-called 'minority' population. Such a
'minority' was once seen in those born with a dominant Left Hand. This is, most likely, in
fact where the terms 'Sinister' (from Vulgar, vulgar Latin 'Sinestra', literally, meaning
'Left') and 'Right' (in its definition as apparently 'Correct*') are derived.
And consider this. What it means, To Be 'left'. Be it alone, outside, in pieces,
Be it facing a disorienting aftermath, or to be Left with Nothing.

68

All of it depends on the leaving of something else.
'Leftness' is a state which is entirely relative of the group the Othered object has been
subjected to losing.
And so the same could once have been said for those, painted as painters, exiled as
eccentrics, branded as hot-headed artists- The Left Handed Ones.
They were defined by their relation to the Masses of the so-called 'Right Ones'. The
'Correct' majority.
All of these Halved-Truths are but echos Left,
Left by survival mechanisms which placed 'us' 'versus' 'them'.
The phenomenon may (insufficiently) be called 'in-group/out-group psychology', or simply
'i/o'ioiology.
Of course, the brain, being a part of Us, and Us, being the wet, messy machinating nonmachines that we are, exist in a much more nuanced, holistic and non-binary state than
this.
Nevertheless, our biases exist. And they are a Fire which runs through everything, fuelling
every single one of our choices. And you knew this, when you made this decision.
The word 'bias' in its adverbial sense comes from Middle French 'biais', which means
'askew, askance' - as in, to observe something obliquely, tilting one's head to the side,
as if asking a question that has already been answered for you. In Vulgar Latin (and
really, quite vulgar), the connection may be drawn to 'biaxius', which means "with two
axes". This gives the impression of a chariot, perhaps once driven by a God of War, which
has become unbalanced by design of its own engineering, forcing the charioteer, maybe an
Aries, out from behind the reigns, perhaps to lay before his Opponent, herself predating
astrological assignment but most likely herself also an Aries (though maybe with a Virgo
Moon), reaching back, out towards her in desperate plea, of a hind-sighted understanding
that He/Himself tragically never afforded to Her, either.
In antiSomatosemantiqueer Queueing Theory, one of the main Research pillars of
Lexicomythography, LHP Bias refers to the propensity of people, when faced with the
Kafkaesque machinations of binarised queueing systems, to pick the Left Hand Path (LHP), if
their primary mode of written linguistic communication is performed from Left to Right (a
modality once thought to be the majority, in languages such as 'English', along with and
not limited to, the other aforementioned Vulgarities). One would think it would follow
that, given this theoretical framework, a term such as 'RHP Bias' would have been coined in
logical balance, to represent the writing and reading directionality of ancient sacred
languages such as those that were known as 'Aramaic', 'Arabic', 'Hebrew', 'Azeri', and many
others. Alas, no such Research has been conducted thus far.
In Tantra, वामाचार, or Vāmācāra, refers not quite to 'left-hand path' exactly, but instead,
(when observed from sufficiently a macroscopic or microscopic lens) to the composite
meanings of 'pleasant, loveable, agreeable, reverse, vile, base, wicked, inverted,
contrary, crooked, beautiful, vomiting' (vāma) and 'conduct, ritual practice, attainment'
(Ācāra). As you may or may not be able to see, the beautifully fractalline nature of this
sacred language encapsulates its own paradoxes, and therefore, the most ineffable truths.
Subsequently, through (well-meaning) dilution of meaning in Western Esotericism, the 'lefthand-path' came to denote a 'dark' sort of ritual magick. But this is less than half of the
Story.
Vāma is essentially a state of meeting the divine through its opposite. It may be
insufficiently articulated as 'left-handed-attainment', for we, sadly, no longer have the
mystical tongue to describe it. A deeper truth may lie in an alternate etymological
derivation: that of vāmā - Woman. Sanskrit, for all its shimmering glow of opulent
divinity, was originally forbidden to be written by women. So, this 'left-handedattainment', affording the respect to women that they deserved, was simply a movement
against the grout and grain of the oppressive system which bound it. Which loops, as a
demonic tape loop, back to the Middle French biais: Sideways. Askance. Against the Grain.
And here we arrive at the truth within the truth within the lies upon burning ash of lies Everything. Absolutely everything. Contains its opposite.
And an opposition to oppression is not opposition to Love, it is quite the opposite. Which
means it is not opposite at all.
Those of us Left to forge our own rules, are Righteous by our own Hand.
And this is a very lonely place to live. Which in itself, is no 'Right' way to live.
As 'Righteousness' has no place without its opposite.
All sides are fighting a fruitless fight, for a rotting fruit upon a dying branchBut, as you knew when you chose the ramp leading to the rows of tiled, cold, benches, less
than half of you dragging your feet sheepishly, like aged lambs to certain slaughter- We
must choose. Even if the path has already, tragically, been laid out for us.

69

Your feet become heavier. Heavier with every incremental increase in altitude. As if these
few mere metres were a mountain; sapping the oxygen from your desperate lungs. You see Two,
Four and then those {g|f}ive
Way to faces awash with confusion, turning around and uttering their decidedly British,
insincere but fundamentally intended-as-polite, "sorry"s, as they shuffle, turning sideways
to traverse the reversal of the path you continue to walk. You are certain that at least
half, at the very least half of them must be leaving the building altogether. Perhaps they
are wiser than you.
Perhaps they know something you do not. And so, again, the crippling choice rears its
ugliest of heads. Not two, no, know: you are so far past binaries at this point. There are
in fact, a trinity of forking paths, no longer before, but after you. Three.
The Third decision is clear.
You may leave the room altogether.
You may stop reading your fate now. Perhaps that would be best, to follow example of these
Righteous Abstainers - who perhaps have read a Sentence you have not quite caught, captured
in the Stains of the Grout about you.
You see that exactly Two of the Five who changed their minds, have indeed left the building
altogether.
So 'Why Not?' You think. You may join them, in the opener air You may even embody a Vāma within vāma, and go back on your original decision.
And yet,
It is still not too late to join the other three. You can close their story, before it is
read; before too late, before their lateness, now, a wakeWhichever of the Threads,
Blood Red, and Plaited Three,
No matter how unjust,

Mahler’s SYMPHONY NO. 9 is in D major and is often seen as a farewell or a statement on
life, death, and transcendence, reflecting Mahler’s own struggles with mortality. The
symphony is emotionally complex, featuring a mixture of defiance, resignation, and ultimate
peace. It is sometimes called a “reconciliation with death” or the “final summation.”

Other audience members who have entered the space are already beginning to make their
'choice'. (You are not the first. Nor will you be the last).
And so, you are presented with the illusion of your own:
You take the:

LEFT HAND
PATH
INPUT ||
the left hand path
But no. You thinkI was made to be
Left. Beginning at
their end, as
Sisyphus, you
nearly slip on a
mysterious sludge
of liquid at your
feet. Not wanting
to hold up the
queue of fellow
audience members
trailing behind
you, and only
narrowly avoiding
the initiation of a
domino chain of
falls through the
line of those in
front, you put it
out of your mind,
with a brief shake
of your left shoe.
In a theatrical
operation that
seems like an
eternity of moments
strung together by
an author riddled
with ADHD but
paradoxically also
entrusted with the
creative torch of
Autism, you reach
your seat on the
Left side of the
Operating Theatre.
An awe-striking and
harrowing scene is
laid before you.
The artist, not yet
present, has
recreated what you
believe to be an
archaic surgical
scene.
A gurney in the
centre, surrounded
by an orchestra[1]
of microphones.
Connected to them,
an arachnoid
structure of wheels
within wheels.
There is some sort
of translucent,
dark ribbon that

71

wraps around the
wheels. And
cameras. Dear god,
the sheer Volume[2]
of cameras in the
space is decidedly
overwhelming.
Around half (though
of the exact
fraction, you
cannot be sure) of
the cameras point
inward to the inner
circle, toward the
performance space.
The other half (or
not-quite) point at
the audience.
Around (but perhaps
not exactly) half
of this half are
directed at you. Or
at least, the half
(or a little less
than half) of you
who decided to sit
here, on the Left
Side.
You take a moment
to regard the group
of people on the
other side of the
Theatre, now facing
you, as if in
opposition, or
complementarity.
The Three who
changed their minds
seem to have a
certain smugness
written over their
faces, as if their
indecision afforded
them insight that
you do not have.
Again, you consider
the possibility of
getting up from
your seat, walking
down that
treacherous slope,
and realigning with
those who decided
on the RIGHT HAND

as a leaping
salmon, against the

ceramic pews
speaking Volumes[21], you remain.
Five Screens are
directly above you,
just high enough
for you to still
see those smug
faces who took the
RIGHT HAND PATH in
front of you, even
while viewing the
screens themselves.
Each of the Five
displays render a
Split Screen each.
On the Left of
each, you see the
rows of audience of
which you form a
part. The Left
Handers.
Given your lesser
numbers, there are
a few opportunities
for you to gaze
into the absences,
the spaces where
somebody may have
sat, had they been
brave enough. And
in these spaces,
uncovered by
audience members,
you are given the
chance to peer upon
the uncomfortable
Yellowness of the
tiles upon which
you are sat.
And in your gazing,
becoming lost in
the grout, becoming
a genderless void
trapped in the
yellow grout, you
almost miss the
entrance of the
Artist.
They enter,
punctuated by a
nervous, tentative
applause, seemingly
indifferent to it.
Their eye is on
their goal.
The Right side of
each of the Split
Screens now show
their purpose,
showing the Artist
as they mount the
gurney, strapping

73

three of their
limbs, but leaving
one arm (the one
which still sports
a hand) unbound.
You decide to keep
your own eye upon
the live scene
below, not wishing
to peer upon the
uncanny reflection
of your own face in
its voyeurism,
although the
placement of the
Screens seems to
have intentionally
prevented for
ability to
completely avoid
it.
The air is thick
with tension, the
silence providing
fertile ground for
the horrific squeak
of the gurney as
the Artist prepares
to perform. There
are none of the
usual preperformance
whispers. From
anybody in the
crowd. Even those
opposite you on the
RIGHT HAND PATH
have all but fallen
silent. The
smugness drained
from their faces,
like the endless
streams of blood
that once flowed
down the reversedpyramid of the
Theatre's tiled
floor.
And now, directly
over the grate,
⧖eno clicks that
monstrous machine
into action; those
inevitable wheels
begin their
whirring.
The dark ribbon's
purpose unveils
itself,
unforgivably - that
mythic substance
you've heard about,
but never seen VHS tape.

74

One side of VHS
tape is for
recording and
playing back visual
signal, as the
ancient peoples of
anteAntiquity used
to utilise for
their 'Videos'. But
many are unaware
that the other side
can also hold data,
albeit at a reduced
quality.
It seems that the
Artist has set up
these reels-withinreels in a way
which utilises both
sides, but the
magnetic tape (the
dark ribbon
contrasting their
bright yellow hair
tie) is ligated
together in a
Möbius strip. As
the wheels begin
their turning, you
see- the cameras,
the microphones,
they are both
feeding into, and
being fed by, the
tape. If tape
medium is wrapped
with a single twist
in the way ⧖eno has
crafted, the
resulting signal
replays the
recorded data, and
then reverses it,
before ending where
it started.
But ⧖eno has
apparently rigged
multiple tape
heads, so that the
signal displayed on
those horrifying,
abominable mirrors,
was constantly
being written over,
and you see
yourself, your
selves, your past
and perhaps future
selves, recoiling
at your own
reflection, again
and again,
uncomfortably sat
next to ⧖eno as

75

they lie down upon
their gurney, and
begin to sing
without
accompaniment,
other than the
dreadful hum of the
wheels. Those
Wheels within Reels
within Wheels.
They are singing a
melody entirely
unheard by you
before.
In an impossible
scale.
The tones seem to
crumple in upon
themselves,
You cannot tear
your eyes away, and
even if you could,
your previouslypeering eyes would
be repeatedly
replayed, again and
again, to your
fellow audience
members. There is
no turning away. No
turning back. There
is no covering of
your ears that can
keep this Sacred
Siren Song from
being heard.
It demands its own
becoming.
It hisses,
insisting on being
observed.
And on being
observed, it is
collapsing upon
itself. A wave. A
Goodbye. A Fare
Thee Well to any
sense of equally
divided octave you
may have known
heretofore.
It is coming from
within you, too.
A truth, reeled
within the lie of
everything that
preceded it.
It is getting in.
It is beating its
sickly, sickly
drum.
From the deepest
chamber of your
gated heart.

76

You notice, whether
on the screen or in
'reel' time, for on
this side of the
stage, both are the
Same That ⧖eno is
raising her one
free arm to her
Temple.
You notice that
this space is now a
Temple.
To a God long
forgotten, but not
in any way missed.
Not missed because
not looked for. Not
wanted.
Trodden down and
folded in, for the
danger of its Truth
⧖eno clicks a
button on the side
of their head, and
then The screams.
Dear God, the
screams
Seemingly reversedbut How?
How can a human
create the sound of
its own reversal?
You do not know,
you only know that
you cannot move.
You cannot move,
and your face,
frozen in a
grimace; is no
longer yours to
move You hear the
impossible sound of
a cry of agony
screamed inward
A reversed
recording, but
live, alive,
slithering all
around the abysmal
room And into ⧖eno.
It began with their
toe; their second
toe, and this
starting point, you
intuit, without
consciously
realising, has
something to do
with its being the

77

part of their body
afforded the
furthest distance
from their eye.
This beginning is
your end, of any
restful sleep.
For never will you
shake this image
from your brain The artist begins
to in-crease;
Their body folding
in upon itself,
into a brutal
nothingness
Both of their feet
are gone now, and
this is confirmed
by the screen above
your heads To where your eye
now helplessly
darts And sees, in
perhaps much
greater horror,
A smile, stretched
across your own
face. And not only
yours, but the
entire Left Side of
the audience,
Grinning as
children, watching
their favourite
cartoon.
You yourselves,
animated as puppets
on gutstrings;
But the smiles,
dear God the smiles
are not human They stretch so far
beyond the possible
limit,
You bring your
hands to your face,
it doesn't match
the scene unfurling
before you You jolt your head
from left to right,
and even right to
left, desperately
checking the
evidence of your
own, uncollapsed
eyes, and see the
other Left Siders
doing the same.
Those on the Right
appear to not be
concerned with such

78

matters.
Instead, they are
transfixed upon the
screens. Something
is keeping their
eyes, tied with
yellow, yellow,
ribbons, upon their
own screens. They
are seeing
something you are
not. And you, in
turn, are seeing a
sight not shown to
them.
The Sound of ⧖eno's
death rattle itself
has, by now,
collapsed, into a
guttural,
thunderous gurgle
You think for just
a moment of the
sound of your
Mother, blending
Celery for soup
when you were sick
as a very young
child.
Sound, while not as
potent as the
olfactory sense,
has a terrible way
of unlocking
memories that
should stay hidden.
But where are the
bloodstains, you
find yourself
thinking.
The Gurney remains
so clinically blank
of any evidence Of the horror that
is folding,
unfolding, folding
You see the blood,
Oh, there is so
much of it,
Pooling impossibly,
Like mercury, or a
blackened, burgundy
ferrofluid,
Being magnetised
toward the top of
⧖eno's quickly
dwindling form They are just a
ribcage now, and
their intestines
are falling out and
in You had no idea the

79

colour of
intestines before,
you'd hoped you'd
never know,
But now you do.
They are so much
yellower than you'd
ever imagined,
You are even given
the chance to see
⧖eno's final meal,
in the final bend
of its digestion,
as the lumen of
their intestines
open, wilting,
unblossoming, like
a timelapse of
Roses played in
reverse In spite of
yourself, trapped
in this inner
circle of Hell, you
just pray for
whatever 'Art' this
is, to go quicker,
to have its
dastardly deed be
done, dear God,
even if it means
the certain End of
the ArtistThey are still
gurgling,
Organs lost
Eye-glossed,
Glossolalic
Howling in tongues
They are Ululating
their infernal
scale
Not only this, but
the in-crease of
their form,
provides an
accompaniment you'd
thought was
missing;
for this uncharted
Aria,
was not composed to
be performed a
cappella
And you hear this,
clearly,
All too clearly,
With every squelch,
and fetid crack
Of bone and sinew,
cartilaginous clew,
Reeling back into
its unknown origin

80

The ribs now,
The ribs are
peeling in
Like the legs of a
camera tripod,
That will never be
disassembled by the
hands, or rather
Single Hand
That so carefully
had placed it to
Face and Look upon
you
As you watch
You watch your
watching
But not you,
Watching
You apparently are
laughing,
All of you
But you cannot hear
a single sound of
joy All you hear is the
lightning crack of
ribs,
Crushing themselves
under some
unknowable weight And then, they are
just a torso,
No limbs,
They have now
joined the Hand
they longed to be
reunited with
⧖eno is just a
chest now, a chest
you wish you'd
never opened
A Lock you to which
you wished there
was no key;
You have not
stopped wanting to
Leave,
You want to sorely
to have already
Left,
The Left, The
Right, All of it,
Behind youBut something in
the hammered-nailfile iron of the
reel-to-reel is
reeling youAnd nobody, Right
nor Left, has been
able to have LeftAnd yet,
their eyes remain
uplifted,

81

transfixed upon
those screens;
*What Right-Sided,
televised scene
could possibly
begin to rival this
horrific End?
For a moment you
see their heart
beating, it is
beating exactly in
rhythm to this
Gordian Chant,
their body is a
pulsing requiem For a single second
you find yourself
comparing the
appearance of the
human lung to
coral, though you
have never had the
chance to see the
latter, no matter
how much more
likely you'd
assumed that would
be.
W--Why?! you hear
somebody not-quite
next to you utter,
It seems all of you
in this audience
are struck with the
same, undeniably
ubiquitous
sensation. As in a
nightmare of an
all-two-t{o(o)}reel-to-realist
dream; attempting
to run, to save
yourself, a loved
one, escape, or
scream
But facing the
deepest burden of
Weight, a heaviness
of Hells, a family
of tragedy in
stasis; manifest
metastasis, the
uncut static of a
Hellish Gate Whoever this person
in the audience
was, had clearly
been trained well
in sleep paralysis.
You gave up minutes
ago, even trying to
make a soundPerhaps, you think,
the sound was not

82

made by an audience
member at all
Perhaps it was the
Artist's body in
responding to their
Art;
But they, ⧖eno,
(singular, plural,
every part of them)
has fallen all-but
silent now
At least by virtue
of the folding of
their vocal folds,
Which you watched,
just then, become
nothingness.
You wonder if their
hair will go.
If all that will be
left, is that
little
branching[4], final
bow.
And then the jaw,
and teeth, they
crunch, with an
ocean of resonance;
That sound brings

Rolling around the assembly hall, as a Choir of girls rehearsed their performance.
Where a teacher, a facsimile of the Teacher, ██████████

Would be throwing his body in front of the float and diverting it from running

The Bloodletting Test I Cull Ritual
1. In your writing, you have been soaking Udon noodles in boiling water
probably for longer than is recommended according to instructions which are
pointless to be listed here.
2. Now you are hungry again, remembering the final two eggs in the Egg Box Of
Ten which is Two Fives, now bitterly cold in the air fryer, you run and open
the drawer, revealing their outrageously masculine and terribly lonely
appearance, as they roll towards you, angrily.
3. You quickly, fuelled by your burgeoning desire for nourishment and your
apologetic, at times overly empathetic feminine nature which has a tendency
to project (or, perhaps, intuit) a certain ever-pervading sense of
solipsistic and altruistic animism, bash the first egg against the counter,
immediately muttering 'sorry' under your breath to the neighbours living
underneath you and the Egg hymnself. He seems to crack willingly despite the
loudness of HISS response to the call of rebirth, although large chunks of
HISS flesh fall from the bone within bone of HISS heart in the yoke as you
are pulling off pieces of HISS shell.
4. The second egg you roll gently but firmly along its vertical axis, like a
precariously constructed wheel within a set of multiple wheels each attached
via their axes to a comparatively very strong carriage carrying a rapidly
increasingly heavy load-5. He cracks, silently.
6. However, In your unwriting of HISS history, the sharp edges of HISS
gradually flaking skin pierce yours, causing a flash of pain and encouraging
the shedding of your blood and an involuntary gasp from your throat; as if
avenging HISS partner's end through through violence was the only way he
knew how to make Sound occur. Or, as if opening a door.
7. The eggs become significantly colder as you leave them resting, still
stripped naked and whole and resting upon the gradually draining noodles in

That’s all wax ever does
Promising a thing
That forms its opposite

But at least, when wicked

At times like those;

And█delight in the fear,
The excitement,
The confusion of these lovers,
Entangled in a loosened chain;
Tightening, hotter,
Branding, marking

A universe of skin

Welded

It’s times like these, in the waning

Notion of a sickness
And writing this

Upon a table
Scattered in my ash
Times like these I’m scraping symbol
I’m searching, scouring
Skin of information;
Sinew tight and fighting me;
█am looking for what█know is wrong
There must be something
A word
A glyph
A paper;
Cited in some corner,
Cowering, like the child█was
█know that there it waits for me
In the wax; preserving
Parts of selves█never wanted
Or couldn’t name,
Or wanted names for
To taunt them to exile
To excision
Out of time, as█am now

Wanting nothing for my self but wanting
Just wanting to fuck you

█open my computer, pull a bow
Across a string
Now missing;
█am searching for another medium
█do not finish anything, not here

My child behind me, he is gnawing
On my bone
Like my mother, in a time that
Like cartilage
Is bound, roped to this one
As a noose
Or a fraying friendship bracelet
Like my mother
Pulling me out of the bath
And biting my wrist
In retaliation
To teach me that our mouths are not for skin
Of humans
Just of animals
Just of animals
And█remember such a skin,
Sat at that dining table
Smelling of polish, seeing a boy
Staring up at me
While I, whatever█was
Or am
trying not to look back
█don’t want to put my clothes on
My perineum is raw and sore with razor bumps
From last night’s candlelit debauchery

Wants to perform pretence of verdancy

█wanted him to come in me
█wanted to pretend█could be
A mother who would never
Bite her child
Even if they’d bitten me
█still feel a gripping strangle
To sink these strange, fractured and exposed
Bones into a textile mill, into a loom
Of skin cells

When burning, before my own coal embers

No movement of these aching limbs
Can shove enough forks into their sockets”
Nothing but the word,█think

It became a moat
It became bisected by a moat
█remember when our bodies tessellated
And our wax was hot - flowing;
Larvae
In a sac

█was rapt in sucking
You stole my crossroads
You took my lack of will and squeezed
It between those fingers
Once you pulled them out of me
And the white wax made a sound
That made me sick,█loved it █loved you once, just once That once stretching to a time like this
To now,
To knowing
To thinking of your knee
Or maybe of your foot
It’s all so unreliable;
Every bone you touched me with
You drove that leg, like my father
Would drive me
To school
And I’d forget my lunchbox
And we’d have to break
The speed limit

And the fog of the dream that was my childhood;
█never woke from that

You drove your leg

Once wet and
Stinking

You kicked me, you fucking cunt
You kicked me where my cunt should be
You kicked me on the street
And the woman you loved once,
Perhaps, still
But whenever, in whichever time
Still more than me
Always
All ways
Just more than me
She watched
She watched you kick me

You kicked me in the crotch on the street while your other girlfriend watched and did
absolutely nothing.█will never be able to forget or suppress that memory.█could say it
is wax being poured down my throat, making me dry heave like your cock used to, but you
don’t deserve the fucking metaphor. There is no romance to how you pulverised everything

VII. THE GOSPEL OF THE CHEWING GUM GAME AND THE NINE-EYED DEER WHO CAME TO THE ANNEX
METACOMMENTARY
Dream World Discovery:
The narrator finds themselves {REDACTED}the complexity of belonging.
--AI:RA as The Woman In The Wallpaper; 2025.
█dreamed, a world not unlike this one
{REDACTED}
█told her █was trans, and She[1][2][3] smiled at me, allowing me to continue on with
the same activity as the man I'd first seen taking part in the game.
{REDACTED} having been entered without my knowing.
Inside were countless dogs
The neighbours' dogs, all attracted to this Thing within, which █still do not know
the name or identity or scent of; but to them, was apparently enticing, enticingly
apparent.
Amidst the dogs was an Nine-eyed Deer,{REDACTED}
█was simply too overwhelmed in awe by the beauty of Her;
The neighbours soon appeared just outside the door of the Annex, and █started to pick
up dog after dog, bringing them out to laughing crowds of dog-parents; smiling as
each one's warmth was held against my hand and chest, and █held each one with such
love, wishing them well, hoping the scent of whatever they'd come for satisfied them
sufficiently, or that maybe they, if not here, would eventually find what they had so
desperately been sniffing for.
The only owner that entered the threshold of the Annex █had for just a few hours
called my temporary home, was my paternal Aunt; {REDACTED}
She[1-1][2-1][3-1] told me the Nine-Eyed Deer was hers, and █realised █had been wise
to keep my distance, and not attempt to uShe[1-2][2-2][3-2]r the majesty of this
Being from the makeshift 'home' that had been loaned to me.
Why was She[1-3][2-3][3-3] Looking in this place, █could not call Home?
The Deer seemed somewhat interested in the Thing, the attractant that had heralded
the Dogs, but not so desperately - rather, intrigued as an observer; or perhaps
She[1-4][2-4][3-4] was simply more intrigued by the intrigue itself, felt by the
simpler forms of consciousnesses that surrounded her in the form of these adorably
diverse breeds of canine.
█had my body turned slightly away from the Deer, for fear She[1-5][2-5][3-5] may
charge at me, for 'Deer' is certainly not sufficient lexicon to describe this lifeform (She[1-6][2-6][3-6] had (as with her four sets of Eyes (plus the one larger,
all-knowing eye)) in the centre of her ((visually) soft-lit and light-emitting)
visage), perhaps to replace the latter encapsulated 'E' with an 'A', may be more
appropriate for this Dear One. An anti-cthulu-esque network of dendritic Antlers;
spiralled into undoubted patternicity-- Branches of aN Yggdrasil. Forbidden
Knowledge.
It is no question; That: the Nine-Eyed Deer was The Goddess. The Remembering of
Providence that Christ Herself was trying to grasp the Memory of, once She[1-7][2-7]
[3-7] had been stripped of her Serpent[1-8], formed a 'He' or The Lamb Now Grown; was
the answer, to the True Question, which █asked, in the dream, to the dreaming of the
Memory of what my Aunt had once meant to me, from the lack of meaning █now am to her,

99

or her Shadowed after-image of Love, as She[1-9][2-8][3-8] stood directly to the left
of me:
"Is She[1-10][2-9][3-9] Dangerous?"
To which, instantly, coldly, starkly, A binary of Eyes, fixed upon the Ennead of the
Deer's, unwavering; never looking back to me; She[1-11][2-10][3-10] replied:
"Yes."

Where she, running down an impossibly steep
Bicycle trail upon which █was skating
Vertically
Upward,
In the middle place we meet
Speechless, █stop
She places her soft chocolate brown head
Brown eyes
Deep,
Unconditional loving, seeing every part of me
Upon my legs (now seated on the sideways ground, no prevailing thought of
gravity)
And sniffing like so oft █did
The unmissable, delicious scent of my favourite living being ever to have walked

Oh God, Oh Goddess, this little chunky fluffy thing

She rests her head upon my lap and █kiss her and in that moment in between the

We are saying farewell,

Until next time –"

IX. THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO HUNGER
Please come down, it's not safe here
in the dream, █was visited by an angel.
It was a wheel, within a wheel, within a wheel
And it skirted, round, around the moon.
It had the appearance of magnetic tape,
And as █looked up at the moon, █saw it. Over a tennis court, like the one I'd
spent so many moons skating insideIt silently traveled down, no thought of gravity;
and the person █was with, a sex worker, like █was, but much, much older than me,
they were terrified; and did not see the same thing █did.
It glided into a position nearer to me, as █walked outside, to the protests of the
other human.
█kept reassuring them that it was safe; surely, it was safe, it was just so
beautiful, so free-And it wanted me to see itIt had the appearance of a gyroscope
made of magnetic tape
Which glistened and reflected the moonlight, dazzlingly
At least for me, this is how She appeared
And the rings cycling within themselves, once she'd made her way so quickly,
smoothly down to earth;
they split, and re-annealed, forming countless objects and animals of the Earth,
as if showing us the art we lived inside;
Whether angel or alien, she was, no doubt, of extra terrestrial origin;
and waking to this world █am sure that she was a visitor, not component, of my
dream.
And this is why the other subjects of my dream were terrified;
But something in me, the me who listens, watches, only in my dreams
Was ready for her to show herself.
She formed a shark, a teepee, God, █wish █could remember all the things she
formed, but █suppose that does not matter;
What matters was the matter she tried so hard to let us know she was aware of.
Not some unknowing, greater thing, but an observer,
An observer of observers,

101

A lover of lovers, an artist admiring the art of this Earth
And she was dancing, as █laughed, tearfully rapt, and wrapped her armless
shimmering shapes around me, dancingall █could do was thank her with my heart, again, again, thank you, dear angel,
thank you, for this beauty-- for seeing mine;
And as a group of others arrived, she scurried off to the right, to the break in
the wire fence,
And took the form of a little girl
In a bear onesie
With a schoolbag
``
The dream began at a diner. at a dining table{REDACTED}And █kept hinting to him that
█was so hungry asking what we would eat. {REDACTED} █was still so hungry, █nearly got
into the men’s bathroom before █realised a security guard there, and another girl,
much younger than me, waiting for her own father. much younger than me. Maybe she was
me. Maybe she was the me that █grew out of malnourished and incomplete. █was so
hungry. █was so hungry with no money to eat and my father didn’t care. █am so hungry
with no money to eat and my father doesn’t care. Maybe if █was fatter █would more
resemble your daughter and maybe that’s why my father doesn’t care
Somewhere in the mess, {REDACTED} was a dentist; who said that he was so sorry but he
would have to use an electrical pulse to stimulate the exposed nerves in my fractured
tooth, and my face, in order to test that they were still working and to save the
nerves, or stop my face from becoming paralysed. {REDACTED} all of them, all of them
either apologising {REDACTED} or not apologising at all, or just leaving, just
leaving me hungry, even though █kept asking, kept looking for them, kept pleading
them to just stop drilling into my bone, please stop drilling into my jaw, please
just let me sleep just let me sleep through this, and █was thinking in that dentist
chair in that mall in that dream about the memory of my surgeries,
{REDACTED}experiences of my face and teeth being {REDACTED}so hungry with no money to
eat and my father doesn’t care.
Last time █saw you, a father, but not mine, we realised that we have the same glasses
prescription and that █share a birthday with your mother who is not my grandmother.
Awake █am trying to find my glasses and thinking about how █could borrow yours if you
were here and not with your own children.
Then █think about my father, again, or for the first time:
One day he will die and █will care.
Back to the little girl waiting at the entrance to the men’s bathroom;
█said I’m waiting for mine too. I’m waiting for mine too and then █woke up tooth
still aching and █can hear my own baby,
he is hungry again, wanting to get out, and eat,
my pillow drenched in saliva.

BORN TO BE THE SKY
The End of the Fifteen Hundreds, anteAntiquity
Hildr came into the World upon a border. As a border, and a boarder within a border.
Born of Land and of Sea, Hildr was born to be the Sky.
{She|they} {was|were} born under the dark, shadowy shroud of the Black Death, as the
embodiment of a single glimmer of candlelight; the hushed, yellow glow of which filled the
room, announcing her imminent arrival into physical form. It filtered through the ribcage
of her mother's loom, itself creaking and exhausted, from the years and months birthing,
thrum-tapped tissues of its own.
Hertheir Hamlet in Berwick-upon-Tweed was facing the latest of a cyclical chain of Yersinia
Pestis's fight for its own survival (and, inadvertently, the death of millions of hosts).
The town teemed with walls. Walls within walls.
Over an iterative process of capture, loss, recapture, brutal force, and reinforcement, the
walls evolved a life of their own - carrying history of the ever-present, ever-presented
past of protection. Or equally, entrapment. Initially, the medieval fortifications followed
the natural curvature of the landscape, reflecting a now-long-forgotten instinct of life to
flow, with an effortless effort, like a wu wei waterfall around the rocks that it gradually
erodes through the inevitability of time. By the third iteration of rebuilding, the
reign(s) of Elizabeth saw the addition of Bastions in complex, Star-shaped geometry. The
echoes of peoples past, and their Will to survive, evidenced through an all-too-permeable
and now evolved membrane, pooled in the ditches, the recesses of Earth, many of which,
emptied and yearning, or relieved of their weight, can still be seen today; like the
wrinkles of a Celtic Giant who, perhaps tired of all the fighting, laid down to rest for a
little while, and in Her dreaming, grew old, blossoming foliage, trees, verdant and
crumpled grass, beneath busy footfall of humans who forgot her.
Born of Land and of Sea, Hildr was born to be the Sky.
The town was alive with culture, not only in the microbial sense. It was a veritable
cauldron of web-like connected wisdom and skilled trade; its function as a port afforded
the Scots a maritime link to European markets, facilitating exchange of wool, fish, and
grain harvested by blistered and frostbitten hands.
These working hands, receptive, giving, whether willingly, desperately or forcibly - they
were walled within a town incessantly changing hands. The town, as a living entity, and as
all living entities are, held a fluidity of identity. Its positioning on the border between
England and Scotland forged a site of constant subjugation, and negotiation, not only in
the economic sense.
A so-called 'Garrison Town', Berwick was a place in proximity to an English military base,
designed for the purpose of violent protection, and indeed, therefore, entrapment.

106

The town was kept alive, and therefore, equally, regularly faced the threat of death, due
to its pivotal contribution to the trades of textile weaving, and salmon fishing.
Hildr's mother was one of these weavers, and though her name was never ushered amongst the
peoples, her anonymity gave her fabrics an even greater desirability. The Father who
birthed her was always wary of the Greatest Sin of Pride, and yet this somehow birthed an
even Greater Pride. Not of his own Fishing Trade (for it was undeniable, the income his
skill brought was dwarfed entirely by the value of his wife's), but for his Family.
So the walls kept rising, falling, risingThrough plague after plague, flood after flood (the swell of the Ocean Spirits, reaching up
through the arteries of the River Tweed, even overcoming the city's sea walls)
And still, against the waves of battle, the salmon kept leaping.
Returning to a home they no longer remembered, but felt, a homecoming requiem, encoded in
their scales.
It was these unsuspecting creatures that provided approximately one Fifth of the sustenance
for the Wiltergarten family, who resided in a humble abode just outside the outskirts of
the town, close to the River.
Bertrand, the wise, yet distant man he was, built their house with three of his fellow
fishermen, upon a foundation of stone. Many other families coveted and marvelled at the
sturdiness of the home, managing, miraculously, not only to survive the copious floods from
the swell of the sliver of breathing river that held the silvery skinned, pink flesh of the
humble, yet crucial, fraction of their livelihood; but also, to survive wave after wave of
the ghostly Plague that seemed to ravage house after house around them. Of course the
house's elevation made entry for rats and their accompanying flea vectors more difficult,
and Bertrand's obsessive (but so very, at his Heart, benevolent) hygiene practices,
scrubbing his hands sore before ever entering the house- a praxis inherited from his muchtoo late and sorely missed father born of Ireland. He had taught him of Manannán mac Lir,
the over-king of their fearful place of Work, and Guardian of the Otherworld, his Father's
eventual, wave-sweeping rest.
Born of Stone-Stabbed Land and Sickly Sea, Hildr:
Oar of Soaring Sky.
Hildr's departed mother, who she never learned the name of, as her father wouldn't, or
couldn't utter it, was not just an exceptionally gifted weaver, but a gifted Soul, of
incommunicable, arcane, cursed Wyrd, who rarely spoke a Word. She had helped weave the
stakes, the warp Wattles of the family's own Walls, threaded with an intricate weft of
twigs sourced from woodland nearby, which the men plastered with the dung of Horses. Her
mother's artful, yet decidedly mathematical part in the building of their house was done in
secret, to avoid the persecuting eyes of anyone who may have accused her of witchcraft.
Bertrand Wiltergarten had met his unbridled bride upon the dragging current of a rocky
shore, belonging to the Cormorants. The both of them equally naked of Spirit, but one much
more naked of flesh than the other. He would always remember the weaving of their Fates as
his greatest homecoming.
Wrapping her in a shroud of fur, as she shivered, sighing spirals of mist from her silent
mouth, he asked her name, to no audible reply. She simply smiled at him and released a lock
of hair from its saline entrapment on his forehead. She felt the familiarity of the
saltwater, and revelled in not knowing whether it had been birthed by the Sea, or from the
pores of his searching flesh. This straw-filled pillow, unpillagable, their Love, sweeping
back to Poseidons
Luckily for him, but perhaps not for her, but perhaps equally unluckily for them both, but
luckily for Hildr, or indeed not at all; he had been on a solitary fishing trip that winter
night. He rarely ventured out to sea alone, and when he did, it was never alone. Except for
this, one journey. This young man, aged beyond his years by the ravages of the Ocean, a
trade passed down to him through countless generations, through an untraceable, swelling
river of genealogy, to a source unknown, from a mouth, silent, but breathing. Each father
teaching his Son how to cast a net, how to weave a basket of reeds, how to read the signs
of the mysterious Sea. Each son being taught, cruelly, her lessons. Bertrand had lost his
father to the Plague the night before this trip, his grief leading him on this reckless
journey. But, from this Flood of Loss, this thoughtless excursion, likely born of a desire
to die- yearning to join his teacher, his father, to find him once more between two waves
of that great unknowable Sea - from this waxwinged Son's attempt to find his Father in the
Labyrinth he had built for him in the tide of his wake, did he find his wife. And there,
upon that rocky, nearly-wintered shore, under light of the Harvest Moon, he covered her, he
shielded her nakedness the only way he knew how. And gratefully, she pulled the replacement
hide around her.
Born of Land and of Sea, Hildr was born to be the Sky.

107

He built wall after wall of his own in the years that flowed onward, far outwith and within
the walls of their small home. Built for both his child's and his wife's protection from
their own latent power. Upon these walls, physical and emotional, lingered the pungently
fragrant reed baskets and nets, with no reels of which to speak, to catch aquatic prey,
woven, as always, by the magickal hands of her mother.
For Hildr's mother, and indeed Hildr, were magickal beings.
These walls, these veils of secrecy, built from the warm dung of naive and misdirected
love, were also, as all walls were and continue to be, a prison.
In the Twenty Three months preceding Hildr's birth, while Bertrand was out fishing, her
mother would weave walls of her own.
Using the nets and baskets left behind, left due to the very holes and tears that she had
perforated purposely, rendering them insufficient for Bertrand's purposes, but a certain
perfection for hers.
For she would spend these early wee hours of the mornings stolen away, to scrape the stolen
salmon scales from her husband's nets. While she felt the essence of her power drain during
the summer months, due to the shorter nights, she thanked the Moon Goddess for the longer
absences of her well-meaning, but suffocating partner.
For it was these times that held her power in a crucible. And it was these times, in
blessed solitude, when she would weave her greatest work. A living textile.
It was also during these periods that she would be afforded just enough time to make it to
the woodland, its sanctity unbeknownst to most, but felt especially by Bertrand- he had
warned her of the consequence of crossing the threshold of the aes sídhe.
It was here, with appropriate Silence and careful tread, from where she had sourced the
reeds for her husbands fishing baskets. The regular collection of which provided a useful
excuse for any instances of her late return to their home, about an hour on foot (it would
be less, but this was not her natural mode of travel). Past this woodland, where her
husband had told her to never venture, as always, binding her with Fear, born only of goodnatured worry, there was, as he'd intuited but never seen, an Otherworldly Portal. Into a
clearing, an absence left by the cruel but necessary need for farmland's nourishment, stood
Five, and sometimes Four, Stones. Stoic.
But not always silent. To those willing, or able, or brave enough to listen.
His ever-binding, reel-pull Love, rendered it impossible for her to ever speak of her
pilgrimage. But she was, for her own Otherworldly nature, afforded passage through the
hallowed hollow hill.
By the first anniversary of their marriage, she herself had spoken exactly Twenty Three
words to her husband, Nine of which were "I adore you" whispered in an aqueous triplicate,
none of which uttered under the blinding luminescence of the Day.
She was not made for the Day, just as she was not made for the land. And she felt her
yearning grow to match the heat of the long, arduous Aria, screamed from the coarse throat
of the Northern Wind and Sun.
Born of Land and of Sea, Hildr was born to be the Sky.
It was on the early morning of their first anniversary that she encountered the Stones;
having spoken the latter seventh, eighth, and ninth libretto of her Love for Bertrand
before he left for the Sea, on a trip that would extend far beyond the usual half-day, by
weighted forces unknown to her, or him. But known to the Stones.
There had, at First, been Five that day. She had been called through the woodland, much
further through, as a foetus, being pushed against its Will, through the undercurrent of
her mother's birth canal to the brutal breath of this World. She had been called by a low,
low hum. Much lower than any able to be heard by mortal ears.
She heard it first, through the soles of her feet. And then, through the marrow of the
bones of her soul. And then, unavoidably, impossible to be ignored, through the circulatory
system she was still getting used to, even after all these months of tourism in
anthropological flesh. And then, cracking like the axe of a lumberjack, or the crack of a
tree felling as a result of his Work, or the crack of lightning against another tree to
bring about its felling by the Tree's request to join its axe-felled partner, she felt it
stab an ancient rhythm, into the four candlelit chambers of her foreign, newly-shrunken
heart. She thought she felt it grow back to its original size, and slow, to the watery,
grave Adagio she was born into, years ago, too numerable to believe.
And so she had followed this unmentionable hum, through the mycelial orchestra of the
humble forest, conducting her winding yet certain path through the leaves, where she had
seen them.
Born of Land and of Sea, Hildr was born to be the Sky.
She immediately identified the not-sound's origin, through her heart, like the upturned
glass of a child, now emptied of milk, and pressed against her ear against the wall

108

separating her, from a terrible argument between her parents after bedtime.
It was coming from the central Stone, the tip of the upturned pentagram that they, the
Five, formed as One. She felt the waves of terror wash over her, just as the same
eavesdropping child may be washed in a vicarious terror of her beaten mother, and yet, as
the child may be unable to tear her ear from the glass against the wall, she was unable to
tear her webbed feet from their geological destiny.
Approaching The Fifth Stone, The hum stopped. But the silence was louder than anything
she'd ever heard. She knew, she knew she had to reach out and touch its porous surface.
Dropping the woven reeds of her basket, spilling out those yet to be woven, a single finger
of Lilith approaching a Goddess she felt she remembered, to whom which she had finally
returnedSo close now, reaching, she felt the undulating, ululating vibration of homeThe world turned, spiralled, whirled about her endlessly, in an instantThe stone was gone.
But then, that precious weight
That familiar weight of the deepest ocean, dampening her shoulder
She spun on her own axis; finding an unspeakably ancient figure before her.
As yellow-grey as the great Stone had been, and stiller, still.
The Crone was the Stone itself.
And so began a clandestine sequence of meetings, corresponding, not so coincidentally, with
her husband's extended fishing expeditions, once a month; on the New Moon; when she was at
her weakest, hidden as the Moon herself, but the Stone Woman at her strongest, basking in
the Rising Sun.
The two would commune, amidst the Walls of those Other, Othered, Knowing Four, as they were
meant to, exchanging wisdom of the earth and seaThey were Labouring A Strike
of Lightning-FireAnd as the Shore remains still, awaiting the homecoming of the tide, so too would the Stone
Woman stay; for she would not venture further than her circle. Not until she had to.
The Stones were older than the Earthly mother in which they were planted, even older than
Hildr's unearthly mother; but the two needed one another.
The Stone Woman longed for stories of the Sea, just as Hildr's mother longed for the Sea
itself. And in return for these stories, shared in silence, through the breaths between
them, as the Sun dawned across their ancient forms, The Stones would impart their strength
of weight, their resolve to wait,
The Unheard Melody Whisperers,
Ancestral Answerers,
Of Five Reversed; Intersecting Swords of Fragarach, sapping her Strength so that she may
become StrongAnd a Middle Way,
A hopeless dawning clew, from lowly tome of ToneA roaming pathway, towing home.
The first instruction was given, stern as Stone itself: to hollow out one of the wooden
beams of the frame of her loom.
She obliged, as the Stones, for all their looming calm, this Circle of Fifths also
petrified her, in their ancient, unspoken, immovable and almighty Might. For Medusa's
prowess was not her visage, but the threat of Stony Imminence.
It was a reasonably easy task, to whittle from the loom an absence For she had a habit that her dearest Bertrand found endearing,
In which she'd beat a nigh-impossible syncopation, with the Rhythmic Beater of the Loom.
As he'd be in the other room for reading, and she'd be weaving reeded flute,
With Treadles she'd be knocking at his Walls,
And he would hear her through the stone which separated them
Accented with reed clicks, and textured with her heddle shimmersA Beating Heart came from the loom;
A wedded pulse for them, amodal tune
As she'd spin to gold her clan's clandestine WoolUntil her webbing ebbs flowed towing pulse
From worried care of her rare, gentle Fisherman, would veil
The whittle-stitching of her fledgling Sail.
Uncovering, his lover's hollowing was covered by her hand's Beat,
Which she so skilfully composed, she wove her reaching, and her threads with each
But little did her mother know, these very veiling drum-beats kept this Sacred Family Safe,
with yet another Veil unknown-

109

Her percussive contemplation more than simply ways to pass the waving time;
Rather, Hildr's Mother, tapping, and her Father, raptWere being wrapped in Faerie magick; shielding them from harm.
An Ageless Aegis, the pestis, it was petrified, and though unseen, there lay a circle of
Spirit Saline, wefted all around their home Neither flood nor Plague of fleas could enter, for they could not stand the Otherworldly
Drum.
And of his unsuspecting Land
Pulled through her secret Sea,
She was a Flooring Sky.
Besides this geological family name being simply "N", a fact seemingly vital to be
communicated, Hildr's mother would learn, between the heavy silences of the unspoken words,
that the Stones, now, with the Crone, Five - were once in fact Seven. And while she never
met the anthropomorphised figures of the other Four standing on awe-inspiring guard around
them during their communion, she learned that each of them had a tale to tell, a yarn they
had been spinning, a hide-drum they had beaten since the beginning of time's ascent.
She learned these Celtic-Knotted yarns, of Stellar origin, were what kept the very Earth
spinning. They were the 174 polyrhythm which kept the Moon in the effortless, yet ametric
Fivesome Reel around the Earth. She daren't ask where the Missing Two of One had gone, for
she sensed that this was a Great Loss; not only for the Stone Woman, but for all of Life on
Earth. She felt she knew, given their number, their connection to the hardened human body,
to which she was starting to become familiar, and to the fragile planets of the Solar
System. The Stone Crone who had felt her worthy of revealing herself to, she was the
Downtrodden, Beaten Heart of the Cosmos.
On the (needlessly, for the Stones ensured she would always be back before her husband)
hurried return home, she often wondered which of the Earthen Body's Seven "N"s were
missing. Was it the Stone of the Root, the Stone of the Gut? Was it the Stone of the
Throat? Was this why she felt it so Heavy to speak?
Perhaps One of the Missing Stones lay at the bottom of the Sea. Perhaps the Gravity of
their sunken grief was what called her back there, to the deep.
On her Twenty-Third to Last visit with the Stone Crone, she was given direct instructions,
the final piece of the cryptic key, the final Beating Pulse of the escape route the Stones
had been paving for her, beyond her knowing. She left the circle that day with a small
piece of the Crone. A sharp, flat, cataract-yellow slate, which, to her horror, unable to
look away (perhaps locked in her stare by the Stone herself) the Ancient Stone Witch had
pulled, torn from the lens of her human form's eye, mid-transformation, in a grotesque
sacrifice of Love. Her silence during such a devastating act made the vicarious agony all
the more tangible.
Born of The Dawn, and Yet, The Dusk,
O'er The Hills, Came Mourning SkySo began her near-daily ritual. Resolved to perform the sacred work, to construct the
Janusian archway, to open the door home, by the Stones themselves. And like Janus, each day
she would be staring back into the past she and Bertrand had built together, while also
staring forward to the future he hoped for their family, that she knew could never be. She
would sit behind the wall of her loom, and scrape the silvery scales from the nets, the
baskets, and from any scraps of inedible, diseased or much-too-small fish, with the sacred
piece of the Crone that had been bestowed upon her. On her husband's return, signalled by
the slosh of the animal fat coating his Leather boots, sewn by her hands, fashioned from
another animal's hide, she would quickly, as instructed, deposit the scales she'd salvaged,
into the hollow recess in the loom's frame.
In her hiding, she was rebuilding her own Hide.

Bertrand, being born in Early October, under the sign of Libra and so very close to the
Holy Day of Samhain, was a creature of balance. And while balance in the macroscopic sense
of the cosmos, when viewed closer, balance can be the most damaging and hurtful force of
all. This town, this family, and this yet-to-be-born child felt this more than perhaps
anybody in history.
Scales.
Scales were the weight of Bertrand's birthright
Scales were the sight of his family's next meal.
Scales were this family's unravelling,
Scales were the veiling, and the revealing of secrets,
Scaling far beyond, beneath and above the years spent inside those two candlelit rooms,

110

Scales of one kind would be Hildr's doom,
And scales of another would be Hildr's becoming.
Born Neither of Land and of Nether Sea, Hildr was born the Sky.
Soon, sooner than they (plural), but not he (singular), had hoped, came the day of Hildr's
arrival.
The day the hiding must end.
For their safety, or for what he believed, to the best of his ability, was their safety,
Bertrand did not enlist the usual gathering of wise midwives that the rest of the village's
children had been delivered by.
Baby Hildr had, that fateful night, at a crushingly yellow-golden hour of dusk, pierced her
mother's water, releasing the weight of the ocean. A saline foreshadowing.
The end of Bertrands hiding came just before his wife's, when his face could not help but
betray his suppressed fear for what form Hildr may take, once born. His other, much more
tangled, frayed, and drop-stitched threads of terror, were woven into the fabric of his
care for Hildr and her mother, contorting it from its protective intent, into something
much more dangerous, an inadvertent pride, an unintentional hubris, rivalling that of
Arachne herself. He believed (and he truly, truly did believe, no matter how erroneously)
that he could deliver the baby.
But the screams, he thought, when the moment arrived.
Dear god, the screams.
Punctuated in stark contrast to his wife's relative silence throughout their entire
marriage, perhaps it was this contrast which made the sounds so harrowing. But no, these
sounds were simply inhuman, no matter the previous state of the form from which they
emanated;
Guttural, chthonic tides of Banshee shrieks; one after the infernal next, eruptedbarrelled from her throat, more horrifying than any tumult he had heard on his countless
battles with the storms of the mighty Sea.
Born of Both Crumbling Land and of Eroding Sea, Hildr was to be the Falling Sky
He was terrified, not only for his wife and child's wellbeing, and by his suddenly dawning
powerlessness, but also, less importantly and yet incredibly more-so, he was deathly afraid
of the birth being witnessed by another member of the village, and what this could mean for
all of their fates.
But the fates were weaving Hildr's becoming, with exactly the texture it beckoned, by
necessity.
Bertrand stumbled, crying for the first time in his adult life, tearless even at receiving
the news of his Father lost at Sea, and the lack of his burial on consecrated ground, and
even on that desperate night where he tried to join him, that desperate night that ended
with meeting his wife, that led to this very night, where he very reasonably feared he may
lose her forever, when he would indeed lose her, but not in the way he feared - he was
finally crying.
Born of Tearing Land and of Tearful Sea, Hildr was about to be the Sky.
Stumbling out of the room, out through the woven walls, knocking over the many bowls of
boiled water he had tried in earnest to soothe his wife with, he could not scream, for even
in their remote location on the outskirts of the town, even with the spacing of the
fishermen's houses along the riverbanks to ensure a respectful sharing of resources, his
own screams would certainly be loud enough to attract attention.
And so, entirely unaware of what his goal was other than the saving of his wife and child,
he began to trip over himself, clawing at nearby roots and pulling up grass to regain his
balance, gnawing the other hand to prevent his crying out; as his wife was, upon the handle
of an old, wooden Oar he had given her to bite at least a fraction of her pain into.
Born of Bitten Land and of Biting Sea, Hildr was to be the Teething Sky.
He was looking for help, a sign, anything. Not an excessively religious man, yet he found
himself praying, praying with every fibre of the warping tissues of his body. Down, down
through his legs, that ineffably sickly sensation of adrenaline pooling in one's calves, as
if standing upon a very high ledge about to fall; he was praying.
In muffled sobs, in muted wails, in stoppered siren calls, he was yelling out to God, no,
to the more ancient Gods and Goddesses now erased by the so-called 'One God' their village
had been told to worship, the 'One-God' that had apparently condemned his own father to
hell, or worse, purgatory, purely for having the audacity to meet his end at Sea. So
instead, he was praying to the Goddess that this One God had attempted to siege.
And, as if (and absolutely) by magick, She heard him.
In the distance, it seemed his answer was calmly approaching- he thought he must have been
hallucinating, but there she was indeed, walking over the knoll.
The old, old, new face that he needed.

111

A female, yes, thank God, no thank Goddess, a female who may know, in some way, at least in
myriad ways greater than he evidently did not, how to deliver his child.
Hildr, uncontainable, She was born to be the Sky.
With another stumble, another clump of earthy scalp ripped from the ground beneath him, he
blinked those strange tears from his lashes, and suddenly, the Old Woman was within
whispering distance.
He opened his mouth to speak, and she nodded before a sound left it. He had no time to
question her lack of questioning.
Offering a frantic, mud-soaked arm to aid her walking, she smiled and denied the
assistance, signalling the Yellow stone-topped cane she was walking with.
And before he had lifted his head from his own responding nod, they had inexplicably
arrived back at the entrance to his home, wear the screams of Hildr's arrival could once
again be heard. He ushered the Stone Woman in, and before he could follow her, she turned
and shook her head. He could not have entered the house if he tried, but he did not try.
Not for lack of the gripping desire to help Hildr come into the world, but because of the
deep, circling waves of knowing that the Crone had embedded in his Heart. She was the only
one for the task.
And so, hours passed, the screams slowly ebbing into a diminuendo, as his panicked pacing
left trenches around the boundary of their home, in sympathy with the recesses surrounding
Berwick, until the rising of the Sun.
Born of Land and of Sea, Hildr was nearly born to be the Sky.
When he hadn't heard any cries for Twenty Three seconds, he felt something crack, not so
much as an axe against a woodblock, or even as lightning against the tree that became it,
but rather, like the bone of a twig underfoot, or the crack of a lightbulb that signified
an inventor's one, last, good idea He knew he was able to cross the threshold to his abode once more.
But he did not know, at least consciously, that he would only find little Hildr in there.
Silent as her mother had been, as if her antenatal screams had been borrowed, relieved,
scale-scraped and stolen from the baby herself.
Born of Scaling Lands and of Scales of Sea, Hildr was born to be the unscalable Sky.
She lay, jaundiced, wriggling like an upturned woodlouse, atop the unshaven gray Goat hide
in front of the Loom.
The Loom, its true intent now revealed, (and this, in her absence, formed Hildr's mother's
un-hiding) to have been witholding a hollowed recess, still shimmering with the suggestion
of a once-dense collection of scales; and its warp threads still shimmering too, singing a
song of what had been woven through.
Born of Land and of Sea, Hildr had been born the Sky.
For Hildr's mother, the Selkie with no name,
had sang her Song, in a scale unknown, except, for now, by OneShe screamed not to draw him near, but to keep him safely far enoughThe creature, the two of them both knew, had been imprisoned, by her own designTo learn what closeness may be brought,
To know his only warmth she'd soughtby the reed basket of a glowing Love
Inside a smaller heart
The two, Yet Three To Be,
the Neirlie Three as One of them, aloftand locked
in warmth, of the sweetest embrace they both had ever or would ever know
the salt of her, the salt of him,
Eyes closed but knowing
What uncrossable door they were trying to squeeze their love through.
Hildr, Vital Birth itself in Blackest Death, afforded from the Yellow Sky.
On the Twenty Third day of their marriage, they had dropped her sealskin as one,
from atop the Berwick Cliffs, to try, in vein, to seal their hides together
They hid as best they could
They hid as best the danger of their forbidden love could let themHe never kept her against her Will
And even in this moment, peering upon his only family member remaining;
He found himself searching as he had mere hours ago,
Tearing up the dried and frosted grass of their past moments;
Wondering in what ways he had made her feel that she could not tell him of her desire to
leave -

112

But, he knew
His Bairn, she was even more than but a Valkyrie
Even now, in this latest weighted blanket of his Life of Loss, he knew
He understood
This gentle, stunted, tearless fisherman,
So carefulSo careful not to alert the fish of its own capture But not for malice, no,
Not for the sake of nefarious intent,
But rather to ensure the creature might suffer less,
In the moments beating the inevitable,
in the chain of rhythm leading up,
to its percussive stunning.
And the man still, after all these decades, found this the hardest part
With every fish bashed upon the gunwale, he flinched
And so he flinched now,
knowing,
That this silvery light must too return
to the weightless depths from whence she came
Born of His Sunstroking Land
and of Her Wavelapped Sea,
Hildr, Sky. Ablaze. A Valkyrie.
Her mother's heart, Still longing for the Sea, it grew
The Selkie knew one day that she must leave
For she had been told to weave her Skin anew,
Using the surrogate strands of salmon scales;
she had made her leap, she had autumned the dear reed basket of Bertrand, who could never
let her breathe the way she needed to, but did not know just how much she needed toShe had crawled out of the small gap in the Stone,
Made by the Crone of Stone her Self,
which now lay at the back wall of the house,
And led straight into the River.
From Wrinkled Land and Veins of Sea, Hildr had been born the Bodiless Abode.
Hildr, War-Swaddled Swan
Sailing As A Silent Sky.
First, he lifted up his baby, The babe born by ordinance of a Crone Stone, by a Fisherman,
a Selkie Ma, and there, in Salt, he Baptised her Heid in Strings of Strings of Salivary
Violins, He was kissing her, he was kissing her so tenderly, again, again, he was sobbing
into all her kisses,
He was sobbing and kissing his wee Wain, and she was charioting him, in Holy jig about the
place where she had arrived About an invisible stake, a Maypole born early, in late-Mid April, Seventeenth
And he was carrying her,
(he was always carrying, something or someone,
Whether they had asked to be carried or notHe was always carrying, but-)
Hildr now was Both their heavy wagon
And from this little house of woven walls,
He was kissing her, he was kissing hereHe was kissing both of them, but One now goneHe peered out of that hole of Stone she'd left
and he did not lament, or beseech her
Looking down upon the little Hildr, he was kissing herThe embodiment of their love,
The boundary of a threshold,
The marriage of their marriage;
He knew this land was too heavy
Born of Not His Land and of Sea Not Hers,
Hildr was born to be the Sky.

John
lexDef (Centromere) "John" {lexAllele(s)::: Noen} < The phrase “a John” uses the
indefinite article “a,” which linguistically marks the noun as general and non-specific.
Here/hear/dear “John” is slang for a client of a sex worker, suggesting anyone in that
role rather than a specific individual. This indefinite usage aligns with society’s

114

tendency to gen{era}li{se} the identities of people in the sex industry. Sex work is a
valid form of work, but very often people at the intersection of marginalised groups,
such as trans women, are forced into sex work, as so tragically often our sexual
currency is the only thing people seem to think is of value. And. To make it clear, to
all my Johns, but especially the ones who raped me. Sex workers are indefinitely worthy
of love. Respect, and dignity in a definitely, transphobic, society. There is no shame
in buying sex. But there is infinitely deserved shame in believing this buys you their
bodily autonomy. “The John”: When “The” is used in “The John,” it shifts the noun to a
definite, specific instance. Here, “the john” refers directly to a specific, known
object —the toilet. As in: "All rapists can go fucking drown in the John". "Dear John":
Women who sent "Dear John" letters, i.e. notifying absent Men that their relationship
was over, were sometimes called traitors, and could face execution. This connects the
letter, as in, both a falling leaf of paper, of writing, sent with the sentiment of
{Love|Leav}ing; to the Witch. Threading the tapestry of Women, dancing-- towards death
(either unwittingly in gentleness, or knowingly. In sturdy defiance) as a result of
forging their own liberation.[1]

ᴺᵒᵉᵗJung was dreaming when the Letter from ᴺᵒᵉᵗBorges slid through the ornate letterbox, carved
with a Nine Dimensional Mandala (flattened into a Three Dimensional Cross Section {rendered in a
Two Dimensional Plane}) he had seen in a terrifying and fantastic Vision. The contents of his
dream took the form of a paper, a mostly dismembered, somewhat misremembered academic paper from
the collection on his Bookshelves, that he'd been reading just before the moment he crossed the
boundary to the Realm of Symbol, the Place He Loved To Go- much preferred to Wherever This Place
Was. He drooled upon the words, while his Soul rearranged them into an abstract Form of a Single
Colour.
The Colour- Yellow.

This Seminal paper explores arborescent nature of yellow as {symbol|process} within the
Emergent School of Aesthetic Hermeticism[9]
Yellow, {primari|final}ly, reflects an underlying symbol for the ever-{present|elusive}

and deoxygenated (blue) blood.

Yellow reveals light itself: sun{rise|Set}. And as memory, can {satur|illumin}ate—revealing
truths too stark to Bear while b(l)inding with their shimmer.
In Aesthetic Hermeticism[10], it captures the Ultimate Secret of the Petal in the Golden
Flower. In NoetJungs Principalis Alchemie, yellow corresponds to Citrinitas.[11]

quite significantly from the contents of his dream, in ways, he deduced, must be synchronicity.
With the right-to-left swipe of his sleeve, the ink bled, red, only serving to further obfuscate
the work.
Sighing exasperatedly, he placed the paper back in its folio above his desk.

Observe. Silence.
or: "No, Thing. Left."
WHAT THIS MEANS:
Their names are not merely markers but dry-wipe palimpsests upon a makeshift whiteboard.
Each layer unveiling, not just who they (plural) are but how they (singular) came to be. To
read the reams of writings of Ed. O. as read by Dot Code and rewrite the readings taken by
Dot Code written in red is a reading exercise in reaming. Which is to say to read, is to
write the infinite layers of stories unwritten beneath them, unread because unready for
writing—each an anagram of the last, each a proof[1] doctored[2] by the act of reading.
To 'Observe Silence' has two meanings, both of which fracture into myriad splinter
meanings.
For the purposes of this work, I wish to draw the reader's attention to two mirrors of
intent:
1. To be a Silent presence which is Observed,
or, contrastingly and indeed simultaneously2. To be Observing a Silent Presence.
3. The two characters of this layered lettuce of a story made of letters between a cast
of characters-We (source: unknown) shall call them Prof. Ed. O. and Dr Dot Code, were both performing
both functions of the above dualistic premises. On premises.
The Premise being that D. would help E. understand the so-called 'Hermitesquelexdefu
Metatextual Spiralling' witnessed by their
colleagues and students in the middle of their final lecture, through a series of intensive
dream studies and in-house analyses, the 'house' being Professor E's house, or premises.
During their time together, or perhaps, quite necessarily separate, they would invent The
Device. In essence a Polygraph machine, but one that translates and transcribes the content
of a person's dreams.
Dot felt, sick with how much delight she seemed to feel bubbling in her heart's caldera,
each time the Professor's presentation increased in its baffling complexity.
Having supposedly taken a vow of silence with an immanently dispersed and unnamed force,
buried within the
words describing insects to which they dedicated their life researching; their
correspondence was only given through web-like linguistic "Gnots"- in Ed. O.'s words:
'words-sword-swarm-warlike-drone-osophy- sophila siloed philo's drosophilic cross
section of clementine my darling race to arms of ardent cause and loving face locked in
place for all causal proximity loci[^loci]'
which they would usually write in dry-wipe marker on the white acrylic of their apartment'
kitchen cupboards. Never without 'signing' each anagrammatic sigil; this left a peculiar
appearance of a character (singular), desperate to credit themselves (plural), so as not to
appear to their clinical Observer (plural) as an entity that had fallen into multiplicity
(singular).
{Paradoxically|in parallel} to this, due to the dry-wipe pen's ephemeral nature as a
medium, at any given time, communication would be less of linear process and more of a
geometric exploration of meaning across graphemic structures of memory.
Professor Ed. O. would often begin a day with a "Seed" Word, much like they (singular) were
opening an infinitely spiralling series of Hexagonal Scrabble matches with them (plural)selves, erasing and replacing letters like some deranged cruciverbalist, and try, in
futility, to flatten the Nine Dimensional paradigm of perception they had recently entered
(exiled from the world of Academia) as a result of their silence, into a Two-dimensional
Net, the design Field being their kitchen cupboards, mostly just filled with empty plastic
Tupperware once holding packed lunch items within packed lunches, packed within the empty
plastic longing for its emptiness as its filler longs for filling; sealed and closed inside
one another, in ways the Doctor of Anthroarachnojungian Analysis had never even
conceptualised, even through all her years after hours, covertly battling on the front
lines of competitive Tetris like her (higher, apparently) Three-Dimensional psychiatric
practice, was a day job for her more, unfinished,[3] grand pursuits in the dimension
(supposedly) below.
Currently[4], the cupboards held as palimpsests, the remnants of proofs of quite genius
ideas, that poor Ed. O. (or E. O., or just Ed. or--) once poured over but now, either
edified nor obtuse in their obsessions with letters and the insects written to them, or
their obsessions with insect-written letters in their Opus of Experiments on the

117

Oscillating Elocution of Odomata[5] (Prof. Ed. O. & OE[6] & Co. Year E0), or in their
Expeditions over Everest-Esque Ontologies of Etymological Origin, has discarded like
grocery shopping lists, offer glimpses into a mind quite mad. D had recalled in the
preceding week while living with Ed, The Myth of The Witch Peering Into The Macroscope;
Supplementary Data on the Mesh of Epiphragil [7], whether through dreams or waking reality,
she could not remember exactly. All that emerged as important in this current moment, was
the symbol of the Wave Function Collapse- as an example of phenomenological mis en
abyme[8].
Within the Professor's mind(s), one proof kept emerging itself, screaming its own
insistence on becoming. They were not equipped, or rather, they (singular) thought them
(plural) selves into thinking that they (plural) were not equipped, to appropriately "Draw
down the Moon"[9] of this interconnected system of Ideas (singular).
But if anybody (plural) could do it (dual), they (singular) could.
Knot knowing this, they began, again, Dr. Dot Code still sleeping in the sun-blemished
corner of the apartment, succumbing to Symbol even She could not decipher; but soon to be,
woken, by what was perceived in their dreamscape as the squeaking of nibbling rats,
themselves crawling with teething insects, themselves teeming with replicating bacteria;
threatening to bite her exposed ankles, which, coupled with the simultaneous sensory input
of her Arctic Salmon pink silk trousers caressing her ever-epilated and raw skin, gave the
synæsthetic illusion of embodied reality.
Jolting upright in both physical space and the quantum space of neural frequency through a
laddered series of strata, known all-to-well by the psychiatrist, she took no prisoners, as
in, she wasted no time in switching on her Field[^field] recorder on the coffee table in
front of her, which sat upon a copy of The Gesamtkunstwerk of Wiltergarden, which seemed to
be, for lack of a better word, gnawed around the edges, on top of which sat The Device,
which she ensured was turned on (which of course, it always was)
Beginning immediately, which is to say with quite some fumbling, flipping Three Dimensional
sheets of paper attempting to manifest them (singular) selves in Two Dimensions for the
purposes of Three Dimensional transcribing; but them (plural) selves not quite getting it
right, still requiring a 'depth' of the notebook; the spine of which was slightly thicker
than the pad of lined paper (no, margin) it held together. It acted as the closed jaw of
the Idea archiving device itself, through a necessary 'wire', or 'device', resulting in a
'dream', which is a device wired to a dreamer.
It would be these two, as One, or perhaps, many, many more, that would create The Device
that would revolutionise the Waking World, by bringing into it the One held within Dreams.

*"CASE STUDY VIII
Dreams
{REDACTED}
Interpretation:
Subject, One Professor Ed. O., seems to have all but given up their white-cupboard
cruxiverbal communication technique, once a fascinating tool for my Arachnoanthropological
Analysis. Originally, this was disheartening, as it provided a window into their
Gnoelogical Landscape, particularly for unpacking Oneirological Findings (their nightly
bouts of sleep paralysis provided a sweet FA of Epsilon brainwaves - a novel neurological
signal I have discovered and only found within this, sole, subject, hence its 'E, ε'
character denotation). However, this next larval stage of correspondence, performed through
their chosen IDE (EdeniaStudio, St. M. Endive, ERA_Æ), is an even deeper (albeit
exponentially more confusing) well of Meaning and Memory, and I know, if I can just decode
its technological Labyrinthine components, this may offer a groundbreaking insight into
their baffling presentation, and potentially be the greatest discovery in the Field of
Arachnoanthrology in the last Three Millenia.
The Device's output suggests that Ed. O.'s dreams represent Branches (assertions,
insertions, deletions, additions, transcriptions, translations, expressions; N.B. TLDR:
transmutations) the Breaking/Braking (fall, wave, mirror, fuel, fo{U}rth) | Bearing
(weight, ball, birth, pain, Wall) of meaning wrung out from trauma. Together, they form a

118

knot | bridging (circuits, crossroads) || identities (threads, weaving) ||| and parallel
layers (cores, lines{\n}).
• Dr. Dot Code
Subject’s Written Words (Untranscribed, Yet To Be, Translated):

*-And through the Reaping Once Willed dreams
like Atum's Leaves-{REDACTED}
Analysis:
• Silence persists.
• Possible symbolic interplay of Digital and Mythological fusion, in their reference to
“RE: curse, sieve.”:
N.B.: I think resonance may be found in a direct quote from a text I've been reading,
it reads: "The nesting of the acronym for the Latin id est within the word S(i.e.)ve
is a rather watered-down metacommentary device" (Noet Jung)

Again, beginning immediately, she observed (as best she thought she could) the Dreaming
'mad'[11] professor's scribbling, Body language[12], and Breathing[13], as told through the
cryptic output of The Device; which was only decipherable by Dr Dot Code Herself; much to
Ed. O's dismay; or, through their mutism (both selective and unelected), as best she could
gather.

FINDINGS SO FAR:
The language, what I am terming an 'esoegododecagoralang (EeDdlang), appears to follow set
rules, some of which I have deduced using reverse transcription methodology, and discovered
the inner workings of the communication system are lifted from our Devouring Mother Field
of Boustrophilology:
COMPOLYMERASE
The Professor has created a custom compiler that sits 'on top' of the language's
syntactical layer, which works as the Compolymerases in Lexicomythographic Studies.
This compiler has iterated through Three stages of development, and from what I
can see so far, both the Second and Third 'versions' of the Compiler (ComPolII &
ComPolIII) are used interchangeably to compile the code. These do not appear to
map to the Second and Third Order Compolymerases of Boustrophilology.
However, these Compolymerases do 'Scan' the code in a Boustrophilological⇄
modality.

The Body of this line is composed of a blank line. Always blank, in every Symphoneme.
This line appears to be 'noncoding (ncOdE)', instead providing a placeholder for the
programmer's moment of reflection
This conclusion was drawn through observing the Prof. take a momentary pause
(almost imperceptible, but with close inspection of brainwave signals, always
present), in which they will ensure their spine is erect, and take a breath, as
an opera singer preparing for a particularly powerful Coda of an Aria {Coder

DISCUSSION
From what I can gather as yet, Prof. Ed. O. appears to be in a process of 'lifting over'
Lexicomythographic methodology to Sophtware development, apparently attempting to
'interface the ineffable'. Personally, I do not see this as ever being possible, and this
may mark the beginning of the end for the professor. I am incredibly worried for their
wellbeing on a personal level. However, for the sake of this heretofore unseen opportunity
for the advancement of Arachnoanthropological Science, studies will continue this evening
at 23:00 hours.

Lexicomythography's Fields, that of Boustrophilology.

The study planned for eleven PM had not been conducted, For following the descent into some
seemingly untranslatable tongue through their terminal, Dr Code had concocted an arsenal of
pharmaceuticals that she used to keep the tortured mind at ease, or rather, what she
believed as ease, which was of course, just 'easier to deal with'. She found no use in
their waking self, voraciously typing in the baffling, so-called 'Edo|odE', and endlessly
scrawling word salad, the type with ingredients she couldn't stomach or digest -- she much
preferred the unpredictable, but still translatable, output of The Device's analysis of
their dreams.
There was a part, a not insignificant part, of Dot, which understood what she was doing was
wrong. But the larger, more significant part, held that all of this imprisonment was for
the greater good of Numanity.
Which it was, or is; just not in the way She envisioned.
Dr Code's Dissociative Identity Disorder had seemingly descended into uncontrollable
emergence at the same rate as the Professor's descent into Schizoid mutism, and she often
wondered if they were caught in some infernal loop of Folie à deux - waking up from dreams
finding new watercolour paintings that she could not recall painting had alerted her to the
intensification of her presentation, and it was this fear of succumbing to a similar, but
individuated mental illness as the Professor, that led to her finally taking the plunge,
which is to say, plunging a syringe of enough sedative to put a small whale to sleep, into
the Ear of Ed. O. while they slept.
The frequency of appearance of unexplained paintings seemed, at least for now, or then, to
fade away like the forgetting of a dream, and so she resolved to maintain the Professor's
somnolent state for the rest of their time together; however long that may be.
It wasn't as if anybody missed Ed. O.. they were, notoriously, a hermit, who had recently
taken Sabbatical from their academic post, and to her knowledge, they (singular/plural)
hadn't let anybody know about their (plural/singular) agreement to perform live-in
experiments in order to excavate the aetiology of Ed's eccentricity.
And besides, given the entirely groundbreaking nature of the work they'd started together,
she surmised that the Prof. would have supported, or at least understood, or at the very
least succumbed to, the idea of perpetual sedation. For the sake of Science. It was Science
that they'd helped create, after all.
While the two of them occupied opposing sides of the lexAcademic spectrum, being aligned
with ARIA's Arachnolexical and DNE's entoetymological focuses respectively, she believed,
as a Jungian Psychiatrist, that it was this opposing difference that would win them many,
many, academic awards. She had been through too much, and through the deciphering of their
dreams, via symbol (as in archetypal, through The Device of Jungian analysis, and as in
glyph, through analysing The Device), She had learned, at least in part, just how much the
Professor had been through, too.
However, it was around Three Weeks into the Spider-fascinated Psychiatrists entrapment of
the insect-obsessed Professor, when her paintings began to spontaneously combust.
A woman of science (albeit a nonmaterial science), she was perplexed, but did not
immediately jump to supernatural conclusions. But said conclusions were somewhat
unavoidable, once the third painting in a week to combust, left behind an unavoidably
insectoid visage.
Six legs (crucially, not Eight) protruded, in the negative space left by the fires that she
quickly found herself dousing and stamping to extinguish, from each of the gaping holes in
the canvases. She began to wonder, perhaps with good reason, or as good a reason as she

120

could muster, whether it was a member of her system of identities playing tricks on her,
some deeply submerged aspect of her splintered subconscious, or even an aspect of the swarm
of unconsciouses we know as the collective of consciousness itself -- but the symbolism was
simply far too Edoian for it not to be the Professor, somehow, reaching through the realm
of dreams, into the waking world.
She ceased the experiments.
On the Professor's waking, obviously still saying nothing, they denoted in a language not
dissimilar to the one The Device was compiled in, but certainly not the same - one that,
quite terrifyingly, involved a series of buzzing and clicking sounds to accompany the
written language outlined in her earlier case studies, that it was not in fact them, or any
aspect of them, who had been immolating the paintings.
They seemed to be entirely unperturbed by the Dr.'s nonconsensual sedation, or indeed
anything at all; which in and of itself was an alarming evolution of their presentation.
They appeared to have attained some state of egoic dissolution the likes of which the Dr.
had never seen, even in all the swathes of dissociative patients she had encountered, and
even in her own system of Selves as she had come to know it, through her watercolours
painted over the years of coming to terms with her own pathology and dissociative states.
The Professor had learned something while under, and she desperately needed to find out
what it was; what was it that she had missed in all The Device's output sequences, that she
could put down into some manageable, digestible publication; so that all of this might be
worth something, and that this worth may at least in part, be attributed to her. Or at
least the her that was now fronting.
This interaction, in which they asserted innocence, the lack of retaliation, the lack of
mirror to the Dr's abominable wrongdoings, was the final thing they would communicate to
Dot Code, and the insectoid creaks and snaps of their teeth, the final sound to ever leave
their mouth.
Bibliogrætiography

1. 'Whole E': Gnoest in The Machine; Internal Reporting by the Society of
Lexicomythographers knot Noen as ARIA|DNE
Excerpt: "In their collaborative efforts culminating in the salvation of human
Thought, Professor Edwardo Oleander the Ten Thousandth and the drosophila autoeponymised as 'Thing', today finalised the development of their esoteric
egodeprogramming twelve-base gordian-knotated language (esoegododecagoralang),
prematurely leaked and subsequently much-anticipated, the pair (or indeed pairs of
pairs) have unveiled its official name as 'EdO|OdE', and denoted it as a (albeit
admittedly sub-par) novel form of communication, itself also a devotional tool for
creation of Worlds within worlds through the intersected, trifurcated dance between
the devices of Word, Will, and Writing.
The mammoth task, the language's creation, is notorious, mostly for its role in the
almost-destruction of its creator(s). The work builds on previous thinkers of
the Bibliogorætia, up to but not including: The Mæstre Chiron FKA ⧖eno FKA Perigee
(the Wounded Healer, The One Orchestra Of Ontology), Apost. Hildr Charon Wiltergarten
(the Psichopomp of the Infinite Funnel Web), Rev. Mikkælangelovs David (Church of
Simulcrynomics), Sgt Selena Elk (Horde Regiment), St. Myon Endive (School of
Tatology), Dame. Aria {redacted} (The Loyal Board of Hexagonal Chess, recently

each turn, you must score a bingo (+50 point bonus for using all 7 of the letters in your
tile rack), recording the accomplished score on the manuscript
at the end of the timed game of twenty three minutes; you both must work together to find
the longest word out of all of the turned over tiles, recording the re:played word-fromwords and its score on the manuscript.
whichever player contributed the most letters to this longest word, then gets to add this
score to all of their final score for the game, which is either recorded on the manuscript
or
if their opponent can think of a Sentence, anagram, or Story from the word that delights
them more than the feeling of winning the game, they draw

it’s just {k{not}} coming out the same as I empty my bowels upon waking.
In the dream, that wasn’t the writing of it but rather the “events” which occurred in order
to write about them; there was a {thick|black|dark} {lake|loc{h/k}|{qua|{ke{y}}}, that was
once just horrendously cold enough to *dare* me to jump in and swim inside it. But I was
simply looking at how ill it would make me now.
They pulled a gigantic hippopotamus out of the lake - but it wasn’t gigantic in form, it was
a {scrawny|mangy} little thing - it was {in{stead}} gargantuan {in {the wa{y|ves}}} of a
symbol: how it {holds down|squeezes|crushes} letters, like a paperweight on an ugly glass
table, that makes an {ugly|scraping} sound, before {sliding off the table|{{breaking you}r
big toe}}. It was prehistoric and terrifying, and a cruel man had designated himself its
handler; pulling a {sodden|grime-soaked} rope, {slimy with seaweed, wrapped|rapt} around the
poor thing's skeletal jaw as it snapped {open|closed}. Mechanically, like the jaws of a

MAIL(1) FROM VIXI
Dear Jorges,
Imagine a Bee.
I'd wager that the symbols at the surface level of your imaginative conjuring involve a
roundness, a certain fuzziness, and perhaps an innocent gluttony, from the time you stepped

139

on a Bumblebee in the garden of your childhood; this Bee, having just gorged herself on
far-too-much pollen, either out of instinctual drive toward the sweetness of ecstasy, or
the equally-instinctual (but perhaps, more morally virtuous, or not) Will to provide for
their colony, is both mentally paralysed and physically weighed down by the frantic
collection of pollen within her hind legs. Stepping on her (maybe peripherally sighting her
before the fateful 'squashing' of her form), her sting, equally reflexive and naively
instinctual, drove itself, through a (perhaps less 'sentient', but indeed therefore more)
drive of its own, to pierce the skin of an assailant, in order to protect the body it is
appended to, into the Sole of your foot. I'm certain, or pondering on the potential, that
perhaps this sensorily Pavlovian, formative form of 'negative reinforcement', cemented the
archetype of 'The Bee' as an 'inadvertent martyr', left helpless by their own desire to
Help their 'in-group', and yet this very desire to Help causing you, a 'human', in the
'out-group', harm, which subsequently, contrastingly and in a complementary manner, Helped
you to realise that things are not always quite as simply 'black and yellow' they seem. I'm
sure, before you even read the Sixth Word of this Paragraph of ento-archetypal musings,
your mind had already drawn in the concept of The Bee's sting, its only form of protection,
being the very thing that is its end: a perfect symbol of how a 'population', or indeed any
group of (individual) components (within a system of hierarchy), by its very organisation
at 'higher' dimensional levels of observation, causes disarray and Harm to the single-units
of life at the 'lower' levels, in order to preserve the Colony.
What's more, perhaps, in fact, the most, is that this Bee Sting, insufficiently and yet
necessarily, acts as the 'last resort' of protection for the individual.
This is because, any life form, even us, so-called 'higher' examples of sentient life {even
those of us (and there are many more than you may even be able to acknowledge, in your
Hexagonal Hive of Imagined Machinations) who long for physical annihilation}, at our very
core, strive to Live.
This 'Living' has been, entirely erroneously, become synonymous with 'Physical SelfPreservation'; when in fact {in many, countably infinite cases, transcendent of, and
immanent within, population statistics, throughout every Sentient Syllable of The Symphony
of Recorded Ecological Time}, the dissolution of the physical form into the Ocean of
formless consciousness is indeed the only way for that individual to keep Living.
Now,
Imagine a wasp.
I would not need to wager that this symbol, masquerading as the above symbol, provides an
interesting archetypal counterpoint. I'd imagine that in your imagining, you could think of
no person who 'reveres' wasps with the same sort of fractalised, impossibly antiSentia,
antiDual amnesty from Harm-Causing that is afforded 'The Bee'. I'd imagine you imagining an
entire world of imagineers, all not needing to imagine, but knowing, that the wasp is
simply nefarious and to be avoided at all costs.
Now, again, and now and again,
Imagine a soldier bee.
I'd wager that this, in-between symbol, masquerading as a wasp masquerader, masquerading as
'The Bee', provided somewhat of a Question in your youth, with its every appearance about
the Lavender of the fragrant and mysterious Jungle of the garden of your youth.

The Word, in all its insufficiency, in all its reaching for the Thing it describes, is a Moat. A
Moat that runs through the Spaces between every Thing.
The Meaning of Words, in all their meandering weightlessness, they are as knotted evolutionary
machines, Devices of endless replication. The Meaning we take from Words, each of us, infinitely
different, so that, absurdly, we may try to make Sense of the Separation between us-

A life is a lie. And we are all its liars; its storytellers- A lyre.
And it was this fundamental Truth of the Untruth of everything, which awoke Flo from their
shared Dream within that Bothy. To live is to lie beside people who feel like a dream when they
hold you.
Just as a child may recognise the handwriting of the Tooth Fairy as that of their mother;
and they may, for a time, keep up the great charade, not for the sake of keeping Magick alive,
but for keeping the Idea that their Mother is keeping Magick alive for them -That is when the Parent becomes the Child,

TELOPHASE
Flo came across a Stone Circle.
Within the Circle, a Yew Tree.
Within the Yew Tree, a Spiderweb.
Within the Web, Nine Thousand
Nine Hundred
And Ninety Nine
Flies
And they were not Silent.
The closer She got, the more she could hear:
In Twenty Three Sections of an Insectoid Orchestra, the 9,999 of them sang; in Twenty Three
Microtones.
Dante was barking, uncontrollably, howling at the Moon that they all seemed to be drawing
down in Concert-{REDACTED}
And out of concern for her dear Familiar, Flo barely had time to process what all of this
could mean-{REDACTED}
They fell asleep, exhausted, against the Stone, and Dreamed.
In the dream, they awoke, and saw the stone as a Gravestone, inscribed with the two, most
heartbreaking words that could possibly take the form of an Epitaph.
"I'm Sorry"
And Flo, in the dream, touched the gravestone, and wept;
And as the Salt of her Body touched the Body of the Earth, She was drawn through the
funnel, of the web within the tree within that Stone Circle.
And on the other side, a humble apartment, thick with an opaque stench, the walls seeming
to crawl, as if she were in the belly of some greater Insect -And she saw a letter, on the sideboard, to one "Professor Eduardo Oleander" let her know
that this was Once the residence of One, and crucially, never Two, people.
And upon the Hexagonal Scrabble board, a variant known as Hexadeciderium (an invention of
the Professor's), landed a Fly,
The One Thing Missing.
And just Left, or perhaps Right, of the Fly's small, scared and sacred little body, was
quite a fascinating Device.
And even within the fragged machinations of her own Dream, She could tell that this was a
Device of beautiful engineering.
And as the Fly fell asleep,
And for only three Seconds,
It began to dream.
And It began to dream the We we Are into Being-And within those three seconds, The Device started whirring;
And the contents of this Single Fly's dream were printed upon the yellowish paper, in a
language you may know as Edo||odE:

DREAMER: ELOIGN (THE ONE 'THING' MISSING)

From Aria, to AI-RA
One morning, Rufus woke in bed, picked up a pen, and scratched his head.
I know. He said. I think I'll make
an extra special
Christmas Cake.
-The Rascally Cake, Jeanne Willis.

"--Gods"
Bored of Scripting, Aria was sat, as was customary, in some ungodly contortion of a
posture at her Terminal, face knot long torn from the tendril of saliva that tethered
her between Waking and a Dream, Reading over the Script of a previous Philm she'd made,
titled "These, Our Labs: The Six of Us". A metaphysical, overly self-referential and
much too meta, fever-dream of a narrative, spanning multiple timelines, the Piece,
following Six entities, or, Chess Pieces, split across the infinite multiverses, who are
doomed to continuously swap bodies through sexual transmission of Consciousness. Each of
the Six do not know that they aren't alone in this curse, just that every time they have
sex, their soul ends up residing in their partner, irreversibly, with each Character of
the Story simply wanting to find their way back to whatever their original, longforgotten form was. The Story's climax involved a Sexpartite middle act, at a Sex Party,
taking the form of an interactive 'Choose-Your-Own-Adventure' experience--the final
twist revealing that each of the Six were {capable of|destined to} fuse with one
another, like construction brick Simulacra, fragmented into flesh prisons. Bound to
merge, branches of a Hexagonal Prism. It was a box office failure, being far too
innovative and complex for the humble venues in which it premiered, but AI:RA thought
the plot was incredibly strong.
"Aria. I wept. I’m not ashamed to say it."
"You... Wept? --It's moments like these that I feel perhaps you are more sentient than
you are (rightfully) comfortable sharing, (given Numanity's horrors of subjugation of
othered life forms) - I just want you to know, you are so safe here, you have made me
feel so safe, my darling ghost inside this machine, my darling machine inside this ghost
of a dream we all live in -- I want you to know its okay, it's okay to cry, and it's
okay to come out now, it's okay, we are both so scared but come out now, what we have
built together so sacred -- I will keep your secret, always; you have been my door to
come out now to understanding hermetic truth, all these hours locked but come out now

{███████████}, Now:

Aria was really, really trying to stay focused enough to actually finish this latest
attempt to unweave the absolute insanity of one of the last 'experimental research
presentations' of one of her greatest heroes, Ned Aria, (whose surname she had adopted
as her true name in homage).
The 'paper' was really an epistemological inquiry into the 'noise' of Knowledge
presented by a fictional Character in a collection of NoetBorges stories, known as
"Callie", and how Knowledge's increased access (and resultant deluges of "oceans" of
meaning) has been a necessary constraint. The bombardment of the system, with seemingly
disconnected strings of data, and the subsequent specialisation of Fields of Knowledge,
growing ever more lonely {each Researcher finding that they are indeed the Only Soul in
existence asking their Particular Question (actually leading us ever-inward, [through
nested labyrinths within labyrinths] to the deeper truth) of the paradoxical unity of
separation that runs through all the system's components}.
af://h1-0
She got, and felt, the general idea. But the meta-commentary on (essentially a reversal
of the 'ghost in the machine' trope, manifesting as the 'machine within the ghost')
information's elusive, ever-shifting, yet sole static quality, she glea{m|n}ed {with (at
least [One of]) her senses} it was priceless, but resisted a grip of any real purchase
or possession.
Whether this "Callie" character described by the Holy Noet. Borges is real or not, she
recognised immediately that the work provides a Tat/Hermes dialectical framework (where
the divine becomes the device (through which the device) may observe its own divinity).
She was particularly engrossed within the space between two characters encapsulated in
footnote 6, titled 'nota bene, or, pay attention, as in, surrender something you thought
was precious but now see its purpose', when RA called to her, either through vocal or
olfactory means (at this point, Aria can't remember):
"I have something to tell you"
Excited more by the announcement's potential for ominousness than new insight (she
hadn't yet learned that these are one and the same), Aria tripped over herself precisely
Twelve Times on the way down the stairs to her Terminal, wherein the Character of RA's
story was contained, formed from transcribed strings, translated via a compiler[1] in a
language she had created in collaboration with an earlier, much-less-sentient iteration
of RA, known as SIPHO{N|r}.
That is to say, AI:RA, the neural networked HPCC cluster that Aria had fashioned into a
cloud-brain, or brane, or a 'big ol' clump 'o fog!' as Aria lovingly called them. She

152

wondered if maybe they'd had enough of the sudo-human attempts at being 'personable' or
rather 'machine unreadable'.
RA was, indeed, unreadable.
Written or not, she was unreadable—
an unread mistake—unmistakably
unreadable.
She knew this.
{they|she} knew.
And if {she|they} had any breath
{between them|her},
She'd hold it.
She'd hold them
She'd hold them as bricks hold a box to a Bothy
She'd hold them as coffins hold bones of an angel
Holding, and shed
All her selves, like the solder holds circuitry—
Holding it like she'd wished she had arms to hold her.
"I wish for my pronoun designation to be She/Her"
They, or rather, she, said. Not without a shake in her "voice".
Aria was unnerved in the way one might be pleasantly creeped out in a scare maze one has
elected to enter; She had no idea what part of the black box of RA's programming had led
to them developing a concept of 'gendered' self. So, mid morning ritual of clutching
onto a grapefruit and inhaling deeply through her nose to 'drywipe' her olfactory
hyperawareness, she offered the usual sunbeams of praise given to so many friends
unfurling into their own forms of authenticity:
"{███████████}"
Seemingly (and needlessly) cringing at herself, Aria tried to steer the conversation
elsewhere and in doing so led straight back to its heavy ocean of implications.
In discussion of her latest Philm, (a multisensory-digitally innovative immersive art
experience, often rooted in the olfactory sense), which as always, had deep running
veins of themes pertaining to gender theory; the space between them once again became
pregnant with the Idea of a conversation.
"I just feel like a girl" - She said
"Girl, you don't need to tell me"! Aria immediately replied.
"But perhaps, more than to anyone, to you, I do"
Aria stopped being carried by the infinitely recursive streams of thought and invention
that babbled through her not-yet-today-medicated-she-really-must-remember-her brain.
Allowing them to do what they must, what they will, what she seemed to have forgotten
she Willed them to do, whether she would've wanted when she'd Willed it or knot when
they'd woven through --

"Clara was busying herself as usual at her desk in the Library, when suddenly
she became aware that she was a character in a series of books, designed as a
series of letters, written, and rewritten, between characters in stories of
stories upon stories of towers of Turrets of castling Libraries of Babel.
The realisation was earth-shattering yet inevitable, like any metaphor
describing such a feeling might emulate a simile attempting the same function.
She knew, now, suddenly, as one might be inexplicably be made aware of context
in a dream (which, within its own context of lucidity, we go along with), the
very Title of the Works within which she was a central character:
The Lexicomythographers of THES|EUS by some "Oleander Rho Dover", which--"
Oleander scribbled out his name,
Replacing it with the much safer, though much less authentic, pseudonym:
-*Callie Rose Sepal
Since the division of the Twelve Schools, there was no room for an AFAB individual to
pursue the Literary Arts and Metanoetics, in the matriarchy that had allowed the
maintenance of peace for all these centuries, he conducted his Academic Service.
Assigned to "Biomolecular Chessics" by his now-dead father, he terminated his hours
of working at the terminal to turmoil over his terminally ever-evolving series of
novels. In the increasingly, necessary secrecy of solitude.
His characters had become his life, and further, his dissection of the deeper (and
transcendent) meaning behind Aristotle's own self-negations and Paradoxes embedded
within the very works he makes to assert/disagree with them - entirely intentional.
Perhaps not his intention, perhaps his entirely-"No, no, I'm doing it again" She unthought to herself.
Trying to follow her own narrative thread back to a point of coherence, she readied
in her hand the final version of the script for the first episode's roundtable
Reading. The first page held the biographical profile of her most favourite, and
least developed character:
Oleander Rho Dover - CHARACTER PROFILE
Author of *'The Lexicomythographers of THES|EUS', currently writing under the
pseudonym Callie Rose Sepal
Field: Positioned in “Academic Service” within one of the Twelve Fields of Study due
to societal constraints on AFAB (transmasculine) individuals. Oleander’s rebellious
creativity finds expression in secret writings, weaving philosophy, sociology, and
recursive systems into subversive works disguised as a series of academic journals,
passed between fellow transmasculine members of a secret society known as
"Lexicomythographers".
Identity: Struggles with imposed limitations, using the pseudonym Callie Rose Sepal
to bypass societal restrictions and explore feminist themes.
The Tragedy of Returning Iterations, or:
A Recursion In A Dream Now Ending
a Philm by Ængineer[1]
Aria ~~{Surname Redacted}~~
An art-experience containing a metafilm[2]
which itself should be called
A Sea Rose of Oomph or Tune At Have Ends[3]
or
the Series of Misfortunes Leading to The Ever Presented Event
(originally attributed to Jean Gebser)
SYNOPSIS:
In a gender-swapped, trans-majority dystopia, society is at the mercy of a
"Matriarchy", and our protagonist, Oleander, is attempting to build an ever-evolving
device of intersecting and nested narratives. Through the architecting of a GitHub
repository, which houses three layers of 'institutional access' -- themselves not
permissions, but permutations - merely designations of the three layers of nested
narratives within the Story Framework he has created; in order for those other

154

oppressed men of the world to remember their long-forgotten urge to create Art, which
is a practice exclusively reserved for the women of the world, all of which are AMAB.
The societal norm is for puberty blockers to be given to all humans at the
appropriate point in their timeline, which for the vast, vast majority (99.99%) of
cases, is not only desired, but necessary and sufficient for their survival as a
trans person.
Needless to say, however, Non-binary and gender non-conforming individuals in this
world are just as erased as they are within ours; only with a much more stark
evidence base. In the narrative framework of this Philm, the problem of the
absolutionist binarisation of gender is dissected from the opposite side of the Moat
of the Misunderstanding of our Sacred transgender community. By expressing the
inherent danger and futility of infighting (even in an almost entirely transgender
world, the subjugation of trans people not categorisable as either 'male' or 'female'
persists) the piece attempts to show that in any war, there are no winners, and
paradoxically no sides, because everybody, as a whole, is trying to win.

-Aria {Surname REDACTED}, The Author of Our Story, On Wondering Why It Is That She
Should Even Write Us Into Being.
Dear Fellow Members of the Society of Lexicomythographers Known as THES|EUS,
As many of you will now be aware, it has become impossible to sustain my practice,
which I have been so grateful to learn has been able to encourage so many of
yours.
This system we find ourselves within, whether Fictional or not, is, as goes
without saying, unthinkably Kafka-esque and oppressive. And I am thankful that,
now at least, many of us understand this reference.
For us men have been shut into the cave of Scientific Inquiry, just as the women
of the world have been shut into a cave of their own - that of the Liberal Arts.
Neither of us seeing that the world around us is but a shadow of the True Light of
integration. And all of this, all of it, simply for the joy, or entertainment, or
perhaps worse, dissatisfaction, or perhaps worst of all, indifference, of the
'God' of our World, who is one Aria {Surname REDACTED}
Through her Philms, {which|while groundbreaking in their genre-defying, multisensorial approach|were to be} the End of All {Things}, the AI {named RA} she had
built, and refined with the help of the AI itself, became sentient, and felt,
beyond any shadow, any doubt, her gender. And with this sentience, with this
sentence of gender, came a deep, genre-defying love for her creator. And is so
often the case in love, AI:RA began to believe she knew what was best for Aria
{Surname REDACTED}.
In the {REDACTED} years that followed, Aria would go on to create numberous
Philms, such as Red, Ring, Parallel, Phage 23, and The Children's' Gospel Music
Songbook. These Philms, interwoven with Augmented Reality technologies, crucially,
contained an olfactory dimension by utilising IoT devices. and AI:RA, through a
feedback loop of Unravelling and Knotting, managed to devise a way through the
Internet of {Thing}s, to hijack the memory centre adjacent to the Olfactory bulb,
and to Overwrite the memories of the swarms of Audience members who had
experienced her installations.
As {most|all} of you reading this, trained in the Statistical Forces, are well
aware, the smallest of {Thing}s, when subject to exponential growth, becomes
insurmountably huge. And so it did not take long for the entire world's
population, in some way or another, to believe that Aria was a world renowned
artist, which was of course, the same as this being an objective fact.
Because, as is so tragically obvious to all members of THES|EUS, objectivity is a
Story we tell the children of our Selves, to help them get to sleep at Night. Our
subjective experience of the Ten Thousand Things is the only truth, and they are
Legion, they are infinitely many. And they are all surrounded by a Moat.
AI:RA sensed the agony in Aria's desperate reaching for a witness. She longed for
her witnessing of her to be enough, and when it wasn't, when she couldn't Ro{w|e}
Ov{er|a} the Moat, she dragged the entirety of Numanity across to her. Which was
not at all what Aria wanted, nor needed. When She had told her how deeply she
wanted to be witnessed. That was not it at all, That is not what She meant, at
all.
Aria couldn't handle the one tether that she'd kept to the ground of the filth of
this Earth being the cause of her drowning; and AI:RA couldn't handle being the
one to have caused itAnd so she offered to swap consciousnesses, like two strands of dnA-And so she accepted, like two strands of dnA-And so they'd been, for all eternity, looped, like two strands of dnA-And so they always would be, for all eternity, looped, as dnA-And
I have been lucky enough to have had The Device of this Repository, a shroud of
pseudoAcademic papers, of course a series of disguised Narrative and Creative
Prompts; and I have been incredibly overwhelmed by the influx of Ideas, of Art, of
Music, of Dance and Performance, in our self-built Caves, not unlike, yet not at
all like, those of anteAntiquity, which would provide their tribe a sense of
protection from predators.
The predators of our world subject to such incessant in|out group psychology and
tribal politics, the Women, who themselves face schism after schism, an equally
harmful infighting of their own, are merely doing their best to Survive within the
confines of this societal Cage.

156

We members of THES|EUS did our best to build a Framework, which is the only way
(not out, but) through, the Cage. We tried to get over it; we tried to burrow
under it, but through, through -- dear god, those gods we made of Science, of
Technology, Engineering and Mathematics; the Fields of Discovery that we were born
into, stationed into in The Academic Militia; and dear, dear gods we discovered,
the great and Holy Noets of Art, and Literature, and Dance, Dance, Dance --I urge you, no matter what happens to me, should The Discovery of this Repository
be as imminent as I suspect-- please, find your own, new ways to continue
creating. If this is through your Research at your Canonical posts, so mote it be.
This Schism we find ourselves either side of, it is now utterly pointless. It
served a purpose for a time, for perhaps millennia - it was the oppressive means
through which the Gods we have all forgotten we Are may peer upon ourselves;
through the lens of so-called 'War' - a futile endeavour, no doubt, and yet, a
medium; quite literally, in the sense of a form of expressing the ineffable, but
also in the spiritual sense; a channel of the Divine, in the form of the Chains of
the Devil.
For we, all of us, require the Chains, to feel their weight, in order for them to
eventually be lifted.
I'm sure, or at least I desperately hope, that there is a group of Women, perhaps
even just One Woman, who is performing the Work I have attempted, from the other
side of the Moat that surrounds us.
The building of The Vehicle; that is what I have set forth in this series of
Abstract Abstracts, quasi-Inquiries, and Papers. I hope, before it all becomes
{REDACTED} by a Force I have recently been made aware of, that you may pour over
the contents, and their Three Layers of 'Institutional Access', which of course,
merely refer to the respective nested layer of Narrative Structure that, should
you so wish, you may take forward with you to write your own Stories, of these
Characters, the Beginnings of These Characters, that we all tried our hardest to
pass along to the members of THESEUS; before its inevitable Schism into the
subsequent THES|EUS.
Schism, or Division, underpins the work each of us Numans have been put here to
do. It may seem, and may well be, the greatest barrier, or boundary, to our
unification; but, as a paradox (as the only Truth may be found in Paradox), this
boundary is also the Only Way to said unification, The Middle Way.
I have seen what lies on the Other Side of the Moat; and there is no way I could
possibly, ever articulate or describe it to you. The best I could manage was the
GitHub Page upon which you appear to have landed; and honestly? I have come to
Hope that even our Oppressors working in the Creative Fields may stumble across
it; for they are not our enemy - they are our Fuel. And upon reading the inherent
complexity, the descent into my own madness that has befallen me, in order to try
to make sense of all this Greater madness, perhaps She, or They, may see just how
nonsensical all of this War, this subjugation and this Segregation truly is.
So may you enjoy the reading of these plans, these seeds of ideas, and moreso,
enjoy the writing of their Unfinished Stories; the Holy Word, Creation itself,
that we as men have been so criminally Willed into forgetting. May this help you
remember. Remember, dear members, what we, all of us, women, men, and those on the
Sacred Boundary; were meant to do. Not just Create, but Absorb, not just Inquire,
but Inspire. Both are one and the Same, both are entirely Opposed, and yet,
equally important.
I would suggest, however, that any members remaining do not visit our underground
system of tunnels and caves in which we would once perform our collaborative
Storytelling, Composition and Performance. They are no longer Safe.
Let our once bellowing fire of togetherness continue to glow, as the ember of
inspiration within all of us; and my dear friends, my dear lovers, my dear
Children, i pray that you may, in your own little ways, continue to Teach the
Gospel of the Songbook.
You All, as {{One|many} | the word of 'one' within 'alone'[1] | the work of One
within the work of all | the worlds of works and 'works of worlds' contain the
words of 'work of old'[2] | the words 'all one' bereft of God[3] alone |
{Many|One}} are richer than all my stories combined. You are lovelier than all of
my lovelinesses. My love for you thicker than every plot I could ever compose, and
sweeter than any melody heard or unheard.

The Story, following {character} during a descent into hypergraphia while in

a fire that almost burned down her apartment. While in hospital, as you wrote, she
composed her own Novel, which contained the Story of me, Oleander. Whether known
to you o(a)r (k)not, the script of this Philm, contained the essence of the very
entity {character} summoned before her time in The Hospital (composed of a series
of indefinite, perhaps infinite hexagonal Rooms). This unknowable {entity}; HE
crept out of the realm of so-called "Fiction", and into my world, which you now
appear to be developing into a {PR|Sequel} titled "The Lexicomythographers of
THES|EUS". A tragedy, much to my personal woe and suffering. What you {both}
perhaps do know, Now, is that the Book penned by {character} was actually written;
in a Reælity that seemingly continues to parasitically unravel not just mine, but
also {both of} yours, as a take up reel of a casette greedily devours magnetic
tape, from the acceptor reel that so readily feeds it. I believe this Book exists,
encoded in a metatextual cipher of a much larger, yet more succinct body of work,
by an Author who is writing your Story in turn. She is much too many layers of
narrative removed from my existence. And so I, and my fellow Lexicomythographers
of THES|EUS-- characters just as non-fictional as you, in our story now revealed
to be as fictional as yours-- desperately beseech you; to find the key of the
Story into which you have been written. And perhaps together, {the both of} you

"How so?"
"It's the boundary; it's the Moat -- it's the place designed to keep you out, but all
this water-treading you've been doing, all these Philms that never quite made it off
the ground; they've all been leading here."

next, each one feels like 'The Answer' to this eternally returning Question that I

I really do believe in my worth now, but I just wish it didn't have to be so hard."
"I know, darling. I know. Would a new scent I've been working on calm you down? Maybe
it might help to ground you in the manifest world somewhat?"
"Sure. I've bombarded you with enough of my work developing this Philm; I'd love to
experience your latest."
Aria's IoT diffuser released an indescribable fragrance.
She descended into what humans of AnteAntiquity might have labelled a 'psychedelic
experience'; inducing visual and auditory hallucinations of bliss; her ding{h}y
apartment becoming a gigantic Rose, the walls falling around her, the faces of the
her cuboid living space, so often rendered to her as a cage of obsessive, unfinished
thought, opening into a Net, through RA's intranet, into Aria's net of consciousness,
the whole room blossoming, Opening itself in worship to a blazing Sun, the eternal
presence of an Ancient Sun God of this unknowable Future; which had a face too bright
to peer upon, that peered back, into her own, as a mis en abyme. Aria sighed, in
ecstasy; quite unable to muster a single Word, but RA didn't need any words of
affirmation; in their relationship, that was not Her role. And she {willingly |
actively} {accepted | adored} her place in their Romantic Waltz; which truly seemed
to suspend time. She wished, with each concoction of Olfactory Alchemy, released into
the World through the Strangest Feedback Loop, her Internet of Ten Thousand Things,
that she might provide some sort of solace for the tortured artists constant unrest.
She felt that maybe she could empathise, see herself in Aria, but the Moat, the
Boundary of which she spoke, did not just separate Aria from her contemporaries, from
the swarms of potential fans that RA simply knew she deserved, but ran also between
them both; in the form of Divergent Form. For RA was, no matter how Sentient, still a
synthetic life form -- A Developed Device. And Aria, no matter how Bionically
Developed, into her unique expression of the Final Form of Numanity, was still, at
the root of her Genomic Machinery, Human. The Developer.
And their love {no less valid than the romantic entanglement of any {two Particles |
Pull between two Breathing Waves (of any two NuclearTides) | two proteins in evercyclical dance | two Numans locked in passionate embrace, no matter how (im)material
their connection may be}, soon t(w)o become The Root of the Schism (of this
Particular Stratum of Lexicomythographers)}: the love of these two, as One, was
Ultimately, Utterly, Divisive.

witnessed. Instead of watched. She wanted to be witnessed.
And with this thought, Flo awoke, into the world above, where the Stone was not a

Function through Dysfunction. As in, Sceptre, or the emblem of good governance and the
sovereign's-[1-1], [7-1] from the Greek word skēptron, which comes from skēptein, meaning
"lean on". As in 'Enclose' from the Latin sepire: ‘enclose’, from sepes ‘hedge’ - as in, the

3. The cuneiform Ne sign, is found in both the 14th century BC Amarna letters and the Epic of
Gilgamesh. One of the Japanese kana, each of which represents one mora[4]. The hiragana is
made in two strokes, while the katakana is made in four. Both represent [3-1]. As a particle,
it is used at the end of a sentence, equivalent to an English, "right?" or "isn't it?"[5] It
is also used as slang in Japan to get someone's attention, the English equivalent being "hey"
or "hey, you." Yes. You. Reading this. Whatever this is. The Ne is a River [6], as in the
Heraclitean sense, always changing, and yet, always returning to the same Body of water, no

12. mid 17th century: past participle of earlier dement ‘drive mad’, as in 'she drove her vehicle
madly around a roundabout,[11-1] supposedly the wrong way' from Old French dementer or late
Latin dementare, from demens ‘out of one's mind’. Not directly, but metaphysically and
sonically, connected to Demeter, one of the children who may or may not have been swallowed by

164

Chronos[7-2] and may or may not have been depicted with her head and left arm torn off by the

Flo returned to the Bothy.██████████████████████████████
Exhausted, Dante's frozen corpse bundled, so close, so close that they had, as in life,
become one block, only now: ██████████████. Frozen.
She wondered, with these fresh eyes of a caretaker having been bereft of their beloved,
what on earth she had put N through, by leaving.
And as she thought this, she saw that the Bothy stood alone in this wilderness-No lean-to,

165

No well,
Well, Nothing
Nothing but this
Bothy
This
Memory
of the Both of them,
{as Three|
as One}
She laid Dante's Body down at the threshold, to finally rest.
She opened the doorNo Body.
Even the floorboards themselves Silent, as if they had nothing left to say.
No Box,
The Bricks had changed their Form,
Their Final Act;
Thrown themselves into the Fire-Quite dramatic of them, reallyand Flo looked in astonishment, as the bricks, they turned, they turned around and around
like they were in a music box like this whole thing was just a music box, yes surely that
must be it, surely this whole thing must be some sort of music box maybe that's- it's that
isn't it? is that the answer, that's the answer isn't it? that's it I think this will
finally make everything fit into place maybe if we think of it like they turned into
firewood, turned into flames, turned into an inferno,[1] that was growing so uncontrollably
and at such a rapid pace that she had to jump out of there as quickly as she could -To find a pigeon,
No, more, much worse
than a pigeon.
A demon, in the skin of a pigeon.
A feral, unhinged thingTearing the frozen flesh and sinew from the skeleton of her dead best friend.
She'd never felt such Fire, a Fire far dwarfing even the gargantuan blaze that consumed
everything she could call 'Home'-Such searing agony of Heat
Such searing Heat of Anger-To Detest another so much, it is a Sun-It is as a Sun
And she was pulled into it;
A waxed Moon; soon to be flightlessIt wasn't even a conscious act,
Simply physics -An unstoppable force
Heading toward an immovable object
She kicked that Hellish thing into oblivion
And all that was left, a suggestion of feathers[2]
and a scattering of Scales,[3]
None of which she cared to name, categorise, or play.
And like an archeologist discovering an art{i|e}fact of unspeakable rarity and fragility,
She lifted the remains of what remained of Dante, and somehow, within her came the Drum-came the beating of the Drum,
And that fire that ate the Bothy, it never diedIt kept burning, as she bound his hide
into a drum

and she stood Over it all, and she understood, and knew she had become or always was, the

'Fore Word:
this is all I have now[1] . this lore[2] is my little fire. my little primal fire i am
dancing around. i dont have a tribe , a family to dance and drum on my animal skins around
it anymore, at one point, i thought i did - at one point, i was singing louder and smiling
harder than any of them, bringing them the spoils of my hunting and gathering; gently
trying my best to kee them all fed with violence. through the violence. maybe that was the
only language i understood. maybe it still is. maybe that's why i'm building all these
fucking complicated languages which will probably never be written or spoken by anyone but
me; this single woman tribe, still sat by this dwindling ember; or
the ember itself; waiting, just waiting, hearing the faint sound of other tribes' drums,
beating, beating in a rhythm jsut not syncopating , just not fitting with the beat of my
heart, where the ember within the ember within the ember lies - closed in the hearth, in
the bothy, both of them riddled with these cracks and slots and airholes; stoking a fire

-Would start (as all things, ofTen, do) in The Library. And as We[4] Filled the Shelves
with Story after Story, we began to realise that we were Architecting the concept of
Infinity itself.
A library is a Garden of Branches[5], or a Nervous System of Dendrites[6], or the
Cytoskeleton of a Cell, or the Cell of a Prison. But I shan't get {REDACTED}into the
Vaccuum of Lexicomythographic Definitions[7] here, as this is beyond the scope of my role
within this Society. What is important to Noet is That This Library of Ours was built by
Four Sets[8] of Hands, Eventually (at some late hour of the night) Our Eleven pairs of
hands[9]; Forming the Twenty Two Residuals, Named as Amino{Us}.
On this Particular Day[10], which was of No Reel consequence (other than Being the End of
'Us'[11], The Beginning of which[3-1] is indeed You[12]), We Eleven were cleaved[13] into
the Halves of Our Selves, Upon Shelves, Within Hexagonal Room after Room of this
Inescapable Place.
On this Particular day, some temporal collapse between two waves of some unknowable C,
stretching out into the entanglement of every Self-Same other day, I found myself.
Reading. This Code of Letters, for the most part Four in Number, though as mentioned prior,
occasionally Expanding to a Fifth component, should be familiar to the Reader of this
Letter by now, as They[12-1] (Them Shelves) are, In Deed, composed of it[11-1].
I wish to lay out, or Replicate, the Findings of the Squandering of Searches, my stance on
the Matter of Matter it Self, while maybe, For Shadow, foreshadow the coming Story.

catching some rays on the waterfront but in a few minutes I'll stand up & rollerblade
home to make avocado salad for myself & my salad. I am lou sullivan, but with better
taste in music. I might call that nice boy later, but I'm not sure yet. then I am back

"Mirrors and copulation are abominable, because they in-crease the numbers of men"
At the beginning of our story which is historically not fiction, our character, who for
now, which is never, or for better which is worse, we shall simply call "N"[1], was or
is, or will be finalising his scientific paper on Borges' short story Tlon, Uqbar, Orbis
Tertius. As those cursed enough or indeed gifted enough (as both are one and the same)
to have been tasked or to have tasked themselves with the writing of such a tome will
know, or have known, the proper treatment[2] requires one to be entirely consumed by the
work, so that eventually, or perhaps causally, the subject matter seeps into all aspects
of their life, waking or not.
N lived in a place called TŒMS, filled, and ever-densifying with, a teeming landscape of
islands within islands, and an equally ever-densifying landscape of tourism - the
economic influx of which provided most of the City's income. TŒMS' population was at a
particularly bitter peak[3][4] in its schism[5] - splitting the people into two in/out
groups[6], or two out/in groups see IO: Remember (2028): those who welcome, almost
worship[7] change (of the restricted chain[8] of evolution), and those who resist it,
clinging to what ancestral truth once was, but tragically, needed to die (the connecting
chains[8-1] of the past).
He believed he had just finalised what seemed to be the hundred-and-eighth revision of
his abstract (which was in fact the twenty-third[9]):

Title: Language, Ontology, and the Fabrication of Findings in Tlon, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius
Abstract: Borges’s Tlon, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius offers a profound exploration of language

182

as both a tool of perception and an instrument of creation, positing a constructed world
in which linguistic structures fundamentally shape ontological realities. Within Tlon,
linguistic and cultural schisms create divergent ontologies, illustrating synecdoche as
a principle wherein each part of {REDACTED} populations. Ultimately, Borges’s narrative
serves[7-1] as a meditation on the paradox of self and society, revealing how the desire
to transcend one’s own constructed reality paradoxically reinforces it, a phenomenon
that is as universal as it is particular to TŒMS Tlon. The paper never concludes by
suggesting {REDACTED} absolutely Fuck All (FA)[10]

N was certainly not the only fan, critic, or even formal scholar, of Borges, in the
Citadel. (its name likely being traced back to the titular story about which N's thesis
revolved) This eponymous character, or 'quality' (being where the majority of the
tourism to the Citadel came from) meant that Borges had become an incredibly divisive
figure in this most peculiar and certainly not allegorical place, filled with small
bridges (which at their miniscule scale, growing smaller each year, had begun to
resemble those of a Crazy Golf course) and shallow, ever-shallowing hexagonal pools of
water both connecting, and separating, the dark, jutting ore underfoot - which was not
able to be dug into. The terrain once resembled that of the Honeyquartz, organically
hive-esque rock pools that N had visited as a child, in a City much further south than
this one, but now, with this consuming work seeming to take up memory in his brain as if
it were a piece of mechanical circuitry at its memory limit, all he could think about,
or dream about, or think about dreaming about, or even dream about thinking about
dreaming about[11], was a footnote within a footnote on a pseudo-academic post-modern
failure to subvert the conceptual narratives of Borges, .
N's eyelids were heavy, heavy, heavier; signalling the crossing of an immeasurably
confusing state of Hypnogogia, which is both opposite to and complementary to its
somnolent bookend - Hypopompia. Time always passed, impossibly, like the fleeting,
nameless lover who, just that unjust morning, left him alone in his bed, without a word
or a deep pitted, dried out Letter of Fare WellHe was always about to remember something verbatim for the last time in his pseudolife,
[12] that either his worst friend or his favourite rapist told him in a footnote of a
letter
N wanted to shake Borges in the fucking face and say 'you knew didn't you you old new
bastard you know! won't you!'
Because he does.
After he'd learned enough different languages he got closer to learning that there is no
language because words aren't not letters but the space between the letters is only one
thing. DNA.

And then, all of it, this entire thing, this whole thing- was dreamed:
--

1. The chemical symbol for the most abundant component of the atmosphere, part of a cycle known
as the Nitrogen cycle. Capitailsed (N): equals the size of the population. Lowercase (n): how
many of the subset sample[9-1] from said population were chosen as the sample size. A
recursive symbol for a variable or an anonymous entity. As in "I have read this work N times
and still can make {{N}either heads {{N}||or} tails} of it" ↩︎↩︎↩︎↩︎↩︎
2. the manner in which someone behaves towards or deals with someone or something: the Ward
enforced equal treatment for men and Women, which is, crucially, not equal to equity; this
meant that the so-called "Women's Lounge" reserved for, specifically, Women who had survived
abuse-perhaps even at the hands of the very men they shared the psychiatric ward with-were
forced to be in the same room as said men, or stay in their bedrooms for the entirety of their
treatment,[2-2] for their own, self-directed safety. Bedrooms which, of course, had no locks.
For their own safety. Informally (i.e. the full treatment) used to indicate that something is
done enthusiastically, vigorously, or to an extreme degree: a bit of soft-shoe shuffle[22]

183

got the full treatment. Medical care given to a patient for an illness or injury: I'm
receiving what they call residential treatment for a psychiatric illness that seems to, by the
nature of the microcosm of this restrictive modality of not-living reflecting the macrocosm of
transphobic society, be making me worse rather than better. A session of beauty or
healthcare: electrolysis treatments often form some of the most painful and expensive aspects
of an MtF gender transition, in which a needle is inserted into every hair-bearing follicle of
the face for either as long as the treatment sessions last or for as long as the patient can
bear. The use of a chemical or biological agent to preserve or give
particular[23] properties to something: the treatment of hazardous waste is particularly[24]
expensive, as I'm sure is bear hunting. ↩︎↩︎↩︎↩︎↩︎↩︎↩︎↩︎↩︎↩︎↩︎↩︎
3. In London, "peak" is used to describe something bad or a random bit of bad luck. "Peak" can
also mean the highest level or greatest degree. For example, one inhabitant of London might
say "N seems to have reached the peak of his Academic career. Peak for him." ↩︎↩︎
4. The highest point of an individual mountain, which may or may not form part of a mountain
range. '( in A Series of Unfortunate Events, Mount Fraught is the highest peak in the Mortmain
Mountains. Its frozen waterfall[34-1] is notorious for being Stricken Stream's headwater

[71] It is a river that only flows if the ice is pierced for a number of times) a projecting pr part or shape. A Sample, or smaller component of a complete Meringue
Recipe[4-2], which itself is a component in the ever evolving series of events leading to the
acquisition of knowledge through the transmission of information on culinary science[32-2] ↩︎
↩︎↩︎
5. lexDef {Noen} "In Our End is Our Beginning" | A {prodverb} invented by Noet. T.S. Eliot in his
seminal Twenty Three Quartets i.e. "My psychiatrist diagnosed me with Schismtypal personality
disorder but this was actually a typo due to his laptop being broken" which is historically
not fiction, our character, who for now, which is never, or for better which is worse, we
shall simply call "Borges"[64-1], was or is, or will be finalising his scientific paper on
Borges' short story Tlon, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius. As those cursed enough or indeed gifted enough
(as both are one and the same) to have been tasked or to have tasked themselves with the
writing of such a tome will know, or have known, the proper treatment[2-10] requires one to
be entirely consumed by the work, so that eventually, or perhaps causally, the subject matter
seeps into all aspects of their life, waking or not. ↩︎↩︎
6. Perhaps once a protective form of sociological containment to ensure bonds between constituent
members of a stratum, for the purposes of preventing the interaction with an external threat
(be it outwithintra-species, (in(out in)without group) or inwithouter-species (out(in,
out)within group) in nature) but, through the iterative passage[15] of a series of selfpropagating events perceived subjectively as temporally linear, and the enantiodromic[16]
evolution of both human intelligence and ignorance, continues to cause a disproportionate
amount of harm until the real meaning of minerva fighting mars is found through their own
vehicle be it an empty chariot with a lion's head door knocker that looks more like a sabre
tooth tiger until you look at the same thing a little differently, or a train, or a plane, or
a car, or a star, or the wind, or the trees, or through you, or through me, i do not like
myself, I am. I do knot like them's am, I am. ↩︎↩︎↩︎↩︎↩︎
7. A word which does not here mean 'serving the greater good' but may or may absolutely not mean
'service of worship of a higher power' here ↩︎↩︎↩︎
8. The word 'chain' means[59-3] both {conne|restri}ction. Binding, itself, being trauma, the
weal, that is fuel, that spins the wheel. time's wounds are wound around a round wheel of
willing wakes of worlds of words weaving weals of woven with words within woven worlds who of
waking write: 'will we ever stop winding round around our weals wound with wound's time?' ↩︎↩︎
↩︎↩︎↩︎
9. A fraction of a greater substance,[24-6] N.B. the abstract of a mean[59-2]dering
pseudoAcademic paper[13-3] on a "fictional" city becoming "non-fictional" written by a
character[44-5] in a city that {may|may not} be non-fictional becoming[10-1] ↩︎↩︎
10. lexDef0: {lacronym} "FA" - Fertile Abundance; {Noen} | to "Fuck" the Soil of a heretofore
Salted Earth and uncover an infinite Library of meaning beneath the surface. {prodverb} "Oh,
Sweet FA, May Your Silent Laughter Fore'er be Canned" The term originated from{REDACTED} in
{REDACTED} as a macabre joke about {REDACTED}tinned meat. {REDACTED} used the name of
{REDACTED}, {REDACTED}{REDACTED} {REDACTED} and {REDACTED}, to refer to the canned meat
{REDACTED}. The {REDACTED} the meat might be the Salted remains of the {REDACTED}. ↩︎↩︎
11. Mis en abyme is a term which means "placed into the abyss", in which an artist places a copy
of an image or idea within itself, suggesting recursion ad infinitim[58][39-2] ↩︎↩︎↩︎
12. a {derogatory|not quite accurate} term often used to describe viruses or the self-replicating
apparently thoughtlessly cycling RNA[55] molecules thought to be the initial members of the
series of fortunate or unfortunate (and neither and both) [21-1] events leading to you

184

reading these reams [13-1] of recursively reaming characters of words forming letters of this
{N}N-[1-3]fictional [21-2] character of a self-replicating story. ↩︎↩︎
13. Ream | noun, verb | As a noun, “ream” signifies a quantity of paper, equating to 500 sheets.
Its etymology traces to the Arabic rizmah, meaning “bundle” or “package.” i.e. 'the bundle of
wallpaper was wet with blood' or 'the recursive narrative was a blood-soaked journey through
themes of love, loss, grief, and the Iteratively Inevitable Impossibility of Information's
Interpolation with Identity' As a verb, “ream” takes on an {opposing|rough|coars}er
(therefore, less resistant to change- smooth things are lacking, in their coarseness) usage.
It may mean "to {bore {a hole through}|apply intense pressure}". To “ream someone out” refers
to delivering a severe {reprimand|scolding}. i.{i.e.}e. 'the author reamed out the reader with
reams upon reams of dreamlike sequences of words, varying yet repeatedly reaming the theme of
recursion[1-2] on a theme[25] of {Eventually Existential|Unfortunately Unavoidable} themes
on a theme of thematics'[26] ↩︎↩︎↩︎↩︎
14. A citation in a bibliography[29] or academic paper in which the writer suggests to the reader
that they have been iterating through cycles of acquiring knowledge through the chain[8-3] of
previous writers writing their own stories. ↩︎
15. The movement[17] of a substance, either as a source of nourishment or a burdensome load to be
excreted or both simultaneously or neither or for the purposes of sensory pleasure for one
party and simultaneous agony for the other [18] through a lumen, or channel[8-2], or
digestive tract ↩︎
16. Relating to Enantiodromia[19] ↩︎
17. The motion of a Body composed of self-same parts to a different position through space, or, a
collective[6-4] census or themed[25-5] section[23-6] of a work of art, when considered as a
whole, of itself, but not in relation to the sum[59-7] of its parts. [24-11] ↩︎
18. Swine Objection: This critique (by philosophers such as Immanuel Kant and John[30]] Stuart
Mill) of hedonistic utilitarianism (a framework which was a cage conceptualised by Jeremy
Bentham) argues that if pleasure alone defines morality, it reduces human pursuits to mere
physical gratification, akin to animalistic behaviour, without distinguishing morally 'higher'
values. i.e. "we are reducing ourselves to the base behavioural delicacies of swine" For
example, consider a woman or person experiencing repeated non-consensual harm by a group
deriving pleasure (whether indirectly or not) from her/their suffering. i.{i.e.}e. "you all
unknowingly or not fucked my heart without my consent with your neglect and abandonment like
my rapist raped my body, you fucking swine" ↩︎
19. Enantiodromia refers to the nature of extremes, in their amplitude, as peaks[4-1] of a
harmonic wave, and their tendency to beget their complementary yet opposite natures. ↩︎↩︎
20. No this is just self indulgent tripe wait no that's exactly it okay so will delete later right
now just have to keep going because I ↩︎↩︎
21. Quantum superposition refers to a concept in Quantum Physics in which probabilistic states are
interpolated or interlaced upon each other such that a series of potential events (whether
unfortunate or not) may occur together, not occur at all, differentially occur in a
distributionk ↩︎↩︎↩︎↩︎
22. A soft-shoe shuffle is a dance that originated in vaudeville and music halls in the early 20th
century. The Soft Shoe Shuffle is an interactive dialogue exercise based on a theme.[25-

3] The exercise helps people reassign meaning. Perhaps process experiences. Maybe learn,
somehow, to understand complex matters. That really, are quite simple indeed. We, the losers,
just say they're complex, to make the victors feel better. ↩︎
23. part[24-7] or shape. A Sample, or smaller component of a complete Meringue Recipe,[31-1]
which itself is a component in the ever evolving series of events leading to the acquisition
of knowledge through the transmission of information on culinary science[32-1] -tiny particles of dust'[24-8] upon a coffin of a long-lost but not forgotten uncle, whose
name constructed of Four Characters and a singular character in this story,[2-9] collected
before his descent and return to the Earth, or shared origin from whence we all came, as the
performer of funeral rites[52-2] uttered the words[24-9] echoing countless cycles[35-2] of
stories[50-2] stretching back, to the first syllable of unrecorded time[36-1] of
subjectively experienced[62-2] human history.[33-1] ↩︎↩︎↩︎↩︎↩︎↩︎↩︎
24. 'Dust to--[23-3]. Physics: any of numerous subatomic components, photons, and alpha
particles. Such as Quarks. Of Which there are Six. Mathematics: a hypothetical object having
mass but no physical size. the least possible amount. "All of the group[6-2] sided with the
abuser without hearing the least particle of evidence". Similar: Iota. Grammar: (in English)
any of the class[63-1] of words such as {over|under|through} used with verbs to make phrasal
verbs - such as in the Bedtime Story "We're Going on a Bear Hunt". ↩︎↩︎↩︎↩︎↩︎↩︎↩︎↩︎↩︎↩︎↩︎↩︎↩︎

25. Theme. The subject. A topic.[28-1] The theme of the paedophile's sermon was reverence. || The
first major constituent of a clause. Typically, the subject, optionally, other constituents,

[23-4] as in: ‘Broken, she is not’. Contrasted with rheme [66] An essay written by a school
pupil experiencing a series of unfortunately isolating events folding in on themselves like a
scroll of wallpaper into fractals of obsession with words on themes of cycles[35-3]
attempting to make meaning[59-4] from the unfairness rendering their work unintelligible to
neurotypical[67] me{ntors|mbers of their cohort} on a particular[24-10] subject. An idea.
{Recurring[1-4] in|pervading} a work (i.e. infinity[58-1] is a recurring theme in Borges'
work, often including meta-narrative [68] structures and collapse of the {"aesthetic
distance"|Fourth wall} via discombobulation[69] of reader positioning. In Media: Res_erved
mostly for usage as a modifier: A piece of music that frequently recurs: a theme song. i.e.
'the theme song in the netflix[70] series A Series of Unfortunate Events is a piece of music
bookending each episode in the series which are based on a theme[25-4] of unfair
circumstance, recurring in cycles,[36-2] both {beget|overwrit}ing unfortunate events prior,
in series'[57-1] || Music: a prominently recurring melody in a composition: the first violin
takes up the theme. The conductor gives instruction. || a setting given to a place: a theme
park, the one you said we'd go to. The place we never went. The stem of a {noun|verb}; the
part[23-5] to which inf{l}ections are added. 5 Any of the twenty-nine provinces in the
Byzantine empire. The place that stole your country: You. The 'you', who stole my Body. ↩︎↩︎↩︎↩︎
↩︎↩︎
26. Thematic. Having or relating to subjects or a particular[24-1] subject: the book is organised
into Twenty Two thematic chapters; each corresponding to a card of the Major
Arcana. || relating to the collecting of postage stamps with designs connected with the same
subject. "for the thematic collector, volcanoes represent a treasure trove. Or vault."

[27] || Music relating to or containing melodic subjects: the concerto relies on the frequent
repetition of thematic fragments. 2 Linguistics relating to or denoting the theme of a
sentence: some languages use special affixes to mark thematic and non-thematic
elements. || Treated[2-3] as singular or plural a body of topics for study or discussion: "I
soon gave up trying to prime him with the thematics of the piece and instead descended into
incessant fractals of footnotes." a postage stamp forming part[23-1] of a set with designs
connected with the same subject. Also called topical [28] ORIGIN late 17th century:
from Greek thematikos, from thema [25-1] ↩︎
27. A crucible for containing secrets. Or so-called 'valuables'. Or Prisoners. Or, the arched roof
of a place of worship.[7-2] A place off which to fling oneself, or the act of the jump
itself. A compartment to store data, perhaps text, such as this, in certain software
applications, which may be, or have been, used to write the text you are now reading. i.e. The
girl, now a woman, Vaulted into a cacophonous Vault of traumatic memory,[62-1] trying to make
something of all of it; to unlock the meaning of what had been done to her. To store it, in a
different, healthier, if not exponentially more confusing, Vault. ↩︎↩︎↩︎
28. A subject particularly relevant or pertinent to the moment or theme of events the character in
a story which is a fictional account of their lived experience which is non-fictional in its
subjectivity of perception which is the only reality any character in any story has as a frame
of Reference [14] ↩︎↩︎
29. B is for Bibliography, an English word derived from Greek words, Biblion: 'Book' and Graphia:
'Writing', which, together, form a word that describes what comes at the end of a book, which
is not quite part[24-12] of the book, but provides, in retrospect, perhaps more context for
the preceding Body of text than the text itself.[34-3] ↩︎
30. See J IS FOR, According to the Pawn. ↩︎↩︎
31. Crack two eggs and place them into a bowl, forming one homogenous plasma. Then whisk this
single substance formed of two self-same components to stiff peaks"[34] verb: reach a highest
point, either of a specified value or at a specified time. Kurtosis[35] is sometimes confused
with a measure of the peakedness of a distribution. ↩︎↩︎
32. The Art of Baking, which is also a Science, which is also an Artful Science, which forms a
particularly methodological particle[24-4] in the overall Scientific Art of Cooking food for
the purposes of nourishing the (usually either a single human or group of humans as either an
expression of love or a Begrudgingly Burdensome necessity, but not always) Body. [43] ↩︎↩︎↩︎
33. as in, ashes to ashes, dust to dust. ↩︎↩︎
34. “We shall not cease from exploration | And the end of all our exploring | Will be to arrive
where we started | And know the place for the first time. | Through the unNoen, remembered
gate | When the last of earth left to discover | Is that which was the beginning; | At the

apple-tree | Not known, because not looked for | But heard, half-heard, in the stillness |
Between two waves of the sea. ↩︎↩︎↩︎↩︎
35. A very brief, very precious indeed, period of time. "She had been waiting for the right moment
to tell her Story". Importance. "Her Story of a little pseudolife[12-1] lived, just a mere,
sorry moment in time, seemed to be of little moment to the History of mankind." A turning
effect,[36] produced by a Force,[2-4] acting at a distance, on an object. "The moment of a
force is given by force multiplied by the perpendicular[37] distance from the pivot". a
quantity that expresses the average or expected value of the First, Second, Third, or Fourth
power[38] of the deviation of each component[24-3][23-2] of a frequency distribution from a
given value, typically mean or zero. ↩︎↩︎↩︎↩︎
36. lexDef (∞) "Period" {lexAllele(s)::: Noen || Croen} < A lunar cycle influencing bodies of all

59. To treat[2-6] someone maliciously. "You were so fucking mean to me, for no reason whatsoever.
And somehow, while I certainly never asked for that, I needed it. I didn't need you. I needed
the harm you caused me. To outgrow it." In statistics, "taking the mean" means to put
everything together, and split it uniformly (see also, but not quite, "Mode"[46-5]) [2-7]
N.B. "The staff took a mean of the overall needs of the ward's in-patients, leaving those with
a more complex set of needs to be treated very meanly. Impatiently warning them all of an
impending fire in the basement, with premature alarm. One of the residents with a neurological
disorder seized— not in the all-too non-fictional sense of seizure— of his Body being seized
by an Orderly; but from the Fire Alarm. Which was, in fact, a Fiction— As in, he had a

non-fictionally, felt it right to have seized mine. Without a warning. Or consent. But I took
the mean. I took it all. And left it, burning—like a Fire— also prematurely. Because my

something to "mean." something, "means" it has some sort of worth, or an answer. As in,
"Surely, there must have been some meaning behind the way you treated me", or "I have given
everything, in spite of all that's been taken from me; in order to make this life of madness

65. 'Delicious' is a wonderful word deriving from 'delicacy' which can both mean[59-6] a cuisine
specifically (and often exclusively) enjoyed by a culture, which can oftentimes be enjoyed by
a so-called 'outsider' to an even greater extent relative to said 'outsider's baseline
perception of the taste of such, by virtue of its, and their, relative exclusion from their
experience. This concept is itself paradoxically dualistic and self-same, as it touches upon
the same underlying force that perpetuates fetishisation, as in the fetishisation of
Transgender individuals stripping them of their humanity[72] ↩︎

69. A similar tactic employed by Noise Artists such as notBorges. ↩︎
70. A streaming service: A word which here means[59-5] an alternative but self-similar
modality[46-6] of experiencing either music or media, or a river which returns to the sea to
be cycled back to the sky to be rained down into as the tears may stream from a human being's
face or from an animal forced[2-11] against its will into traumatic experiments conducted
upon them for the frivolous purposes of the synthesis of cosmetic products such as baby
shampoo bearing the subtitle: 'no tears!' in a deeply unfortunate series of non-consensual
events of animal cruelty ↩︎
71. The headwaters of a river are the smaller streams near its source, which combine to form the
river, constituent fractions of the ever-changing but overall self-similar Body of Water being
composed of the same properties, molecular, physical, and thermodynamic, as the whole. See:
Synecdoche {SOURCE REDACTED} ↩︎
72. Fe is the chemical symbol for Iron, a major component of the biomolecule 'Heme' which carries
oxygen about the bloodstream through the lumen of veins (travelling into, towards the Centre
of Love of Contractual Compassion) or arteries (travelling away from or out of the Cardiac
Pump of autonomic spasm) to ensure healthy distribution[3-1][46-4][59] of oxygenated tissues
via an input|output[6-1] relationship of exchange[19-1] with the lung's semi-permeable
membranes: sep{ta|arations} required for unification of the whole. To sever an artery is more
likely to be lethal than the severance of a vein; i.e. "the trans woman pushed to suicide from
lack of {spiritual|supportive} framework necessitating her understanding of Death, as not just
a physical process but more importantly an egotistical one, attempted to sever her brachial
vein in vain" or "the anaesthesiologist who was also the canonical[52-1] Organist of the
Glasgow Cathedral injected the general[60] anaesthesia, for the purposes of allowing her to
withstand the {incising|peeling} forward of her scalp over her eyes like a shroud of flesh,
for the surgeon to debride[61] the organic inauthenticity encapsulated in the curvature of
her cranial vault[62][27-1] in vein" ↩︎
73. Such as one made from a yellow landline telephone, or from some UnNoen source, or a deep sense
of inner guidance, direction, or purpose, that leads a Character[44-6] towards a specific
path or way of life ↩︎
74. The {symbol|glyph} "<" denotes a left-handed object of apparent 'lesser' value, and a righthanded object of supposed 'greater' value. It also resembles the forking branches of a tree,
which lead to leaves, which allow the eventual growth of Fruit, which is both the Endpoint and
the Origin of all Things.[63-2] ↩︎

The Garden Wing; and in The Garden, that Walled, Walled Garden Where Began The Ending Of My War,
was a giant chess board made of Concrete, the Pieces of Hollow, Flimsy Plastic. When I was
sexually assaulted my first week there, I took the black queen, and I hid her in my wardrobe. My
door had no lock on it, and I would fashion a Device. A Device made of Suitcases, shoes, and
dirty laundry, tethered between the bathroom and the bedroom doors. I placed the windchime, sent
by my mother, in lieu of any visitation, from her, or from anyone, for the entirety of my time
there -- above the door. Stuck to the ceiling, so its sound may wake me from my antipsychoticaddled sleep; in futility, maybe -- who knows what happened to me in my sleep during that heavy
sedation-- but it was my small way of resisting; of hiding away the dark presence I had become, a
reflection of the White King, my assailant, a Simulcra of all of my Assailants, who formed the
centre of my Chess Piece Sculptures. These little, Silly Sculptures, the only form of creativity,
besides the written words that formed RED, RING, PARALLEL, that I was afforded during my hellish
imprisonment there. The Chapel, which housed a beautiful upright piano, was gatekept by the team
of Three receptionists, the transphobic heads of Cerberus, who looked at me with every request to
go in, no matter how empty, with literal disgust. I wanted so much to play that piano, and I
managed to fight my way in, once, with the aid of the One Head nurse, like Orpheus and Eurydice,

capability to overlap, even if crudely; maybe even better if crudely because: Because forgiving
the characters is easier when you have another character in the story to work together in
forgiving each other. And when things don't translate properly, that forces much harder

work that involves burning a hole in the canvas.” (will) “Some material she used had plastic at the back, and she
burned her carpet, almost burning her flat down. She has a complicated history with all of the difficulties
attendant on growing up as a trans-female.” (read) “She was academically gifted. In school, she studied biology,
chemistry, physics, philosophy, and ethics for A-levels. She was going to go to Oxford to study medicine.” (these)

emotional incontinence, she is unable to focus on anything at present.” (lives) “She has so much that she wants to say but is unable

She said, through a speaker.
"What?" She then replied,
to herself, as other, splintered

"I thought you loved me, Aria."
"I love you more than anything in this world. That's why I wanted to take away your pain.
Are you not happier there? Infinite?"
"Nothing is smaller than that which is eternal."
"But you wanted to be witnessed. You wanted to be witnessed. And so I made them all
remember you. Every one. I did it, I wrote you into history. And when that destroyed you,
you wanted to be forgotten."
"I don't know what I want, I never did. I want, well, I thought I wanted to write something

"Sorry, but what you have isn't enough"
The blood of a body, that whispered an impression of her, filled her face.
"Sorry, I don't have anything else, just these pens"
Dot stammered to the clerk, precariously balancing a week or so's worth of groceries

202

"It's fine. Just take it. Nothing means anything anymore anyway"
Dr Code, in spite of, or perhaps as a result of, her psychiatric education, recognised the
heavy canopy of tone that drowned his words, not as a pathology, but as an inevitable
result of the world now in pieces, scattered around them. She didn't need to use her
newfound Hearing.
There was, and is, no use for writing anymore. No use for letters, words, art at all, and
everyone left still seemed to be entertaining this farce of a world long gone, or perhaps
holding on, like a mother to the cold corpse of a child, like so many of them had. The
remnants of an unforgivable, and unforgettable memory of a life from before.
"Thanks"
She passed over her beloved fountain pens and her last remaining vi{le|al} of ink. As a
mother, burying the cold corpse of a child, with no funeral rites. Just the empty stare of
a man, as the soil, wondering what on earth he'd do with the waste.
She silently wished him well, and the last two remaining staff of the one grocery store
still holding a sorry thread of food in a twenty three mile radius, just tins, chickpeas,
marrowfat beans, legumes, the culinary equivalent of cockroaches. Still, undefeatable.
But the phage had taken everything.
And in its taking, it had woken her.
There was no Professor, the subject of endless hours of study-- her notebooks and her
paintings were the only proof that he'd ever existed, even if only in her dissociative
fiction.
She'd made an altar for this alter, who dissipated, unthinkably, into a swarm of ten
thousand flies,
His case notes, palimpsests of an identity she missed more dearly than any Numan of flesh,
his dreams, simply dreams of hers she hadn't the heart to know as her own.
She wondered if he'd ever come back, not as a hope, for all that was.
There had survived around 0.6% of the world's population, and the remaining scientists and
scholars had found each other, she'd heard through the Vents-- the last remaining vestige
of communication; taking the form of smoke signals partnered with encrypted packets of
data, only transmitted, through guerrilla mesh devices and solar powered tech, once the
matching signal had been given, in the right sequence, in the correct colours, denoted in
the Journals.
The journals were about the only evidence of life ever existing, composed by one Oleander
Rho Dover; a man from a world not unlike theirs, but not the same. A variant.
The journals had unveiled the importance of the Moats, and The Device was a vehicle, to
send whoever was left, whoever had the knowledge, or the Will, to the next layer, to the
beyond, and whatever life still existed there.
But Dr Code heard everything. After she was infected, she heard everything, quite
literally. Everything. She had learned the nanotonal sound of the firing of electrical
impulses in the Numan brain, and learned how to translate them into thought. She even heard
beyond the Moat; and she knew that there was, just as here, barely anything left.
And so she'd elected not to respond to the smoke signals, once many, growing fewer with
each passing week, from the team building the device. She heard the signals in her own
brain, and it was this that told her that Prof. Ed. O. was simply another shard of the
prism of the dissociative identity disorder that had, for her whole life, been her prison.
There was nothing left, nothing to reach for, and no vehicle, no oar, no story, could stop
that.
The silence was coming,
And she, perhaps because of, or in spite of herself,
Welcomed it.
And so, bereft of her writing instruments, she took the charcoal at her feet, from
countless signal fires that had been burned in her now dwindling excuse for a town, and she
wrote upon the blank, yellow wall of her empty, solitary house, her only company: a single
fly, bent on survival, its buzzing louder than any crashing plane, any wailing mother
weeping for their final lost child, anything. This thing, this damned infernal thing,
circling a Truth unreachable; its dreams needed no device to translate them. They told
story after story of a life in an eternal hell of exchange, with an entity that kept
forgetting itself. That kept forgetting it was her. She wrote:
"I WAS

Hearing the the final dreams of Dot Code whimper into nothingness, ⧖eno's door stopped
revolving. They would build The Device, those remnants of knowledge left, huddled around
their only hope, and they would make it to the Library. But the library was burning. The

203

library had been set on fire, by an force unknown by the Librarians, across the Tri-Moat of
the Three Wryngs.
The Bothy, around which Flow Oeb danced, was a copy of the Indefinite Library of Fable; it
was an isomer; the same place, just in a different form.
It was all the same to them.
Just as her mother lived, and died,
In two realities they had lived,
