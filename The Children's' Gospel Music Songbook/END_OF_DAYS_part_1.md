<span class="depth-5">Picturing faces of her and of me and you (never meant to B for {REDACTED})</span>
<span class="depth-5">Mid framing pictures in reels of tape waking in two parts of you</span>
<span class="depth-5">Dreaming in part of me dreaming in part of you</span>
<span class="depth-5">I dreamt of a wedding and my sister was there with me watching you</span>
<span class="depth-5">Two at a table another far too close and too far from you</span>
<span class="depth-5">I dreamt of a wedding of two friends of the two of you</span>
<span class="depth-5">Were wearing a joker’s (like decks of cards or comic book) suit</span>
<span class="depth-5">And I confronted you she said not a word but you were so cruel and I said fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you and I looked at you both and said fuck you fuck you yes the both of you</span>
<span class="depth-5">Awkwardly leaving the celebrating people of the party quite starkly and stylelessly messy and loudly announced</span>
<span class="depth-5">I watch a clock ticking down in my bank account</span>
<span class="depth-5">And Lauren she was pulling me through a space in a railing and I had become paralysed explaining the pain of you parts of you left lame and tangled inside of who I thought I was now left there on the dance floor barefoot next to shoe after shoe paired with shoes upon shoes upon shores so floor-crawling brawling lapped like dogs of hounding hellish waves with crests and fledgling ending spring chicken breasts of such unrest the rest of those awful unbearably boring and bored hole cunt wedding guests thank goddess her dress was blue showing me it’s not your wedding but it could have been sitting on that smoke-stained Edinburgh sofa you, standing, asked me what I thought of asking her to marry you in the first few months of what fumbling nonsense the never us was and on the phone weeping years later her saying in such resolved consolation they’ll never marry me but I knew what you had asked me and that one day I’d have to be leaving all this mess$ or be left bereft betraying me and all my inheld-input-put-back-on-the-shelves to collect dust-to-dust-to-must-just-be-all-a one day all this smelly-eggless-cracked-with-cress-and-opened-chest-and-sandwiched-body-in-that-bed-for-three-for-you-and-her-but-not-for-me-and-my-too-wet-sweat-getting-used-to-estrogen-hormonal-balance-acting-like-this-all-was-okay-soaking-corpse-turned-over-ovumless could be you but never us but at least I tried through untrusting and trussed unease almost dying as I pushed through the trails of the dust and in rage of the reigning wrath inside you just is the storm of the</span>
<span class="depth-5">I was half-pulled through the gap in a bannister like the gap in the bed bunk in game my sister and I would play nightly when we were bored and sleep was evading us hating the sound of such counting of sheep but I used to pull Lauren by leg through the space in between the wood planks I remember her saying just give me a chance to turn my face sideways so my chin doesn’t get stuck and I make it through luckily she always managed to unscathed as I’d giggle impatient like some small demon or devil on the BottomBB bunk merely four years younger than she was this angel who’d happily risk her own pain for my laughing but in the dream I was the one being dragged not down to a non-sorry supervillain’s laughter but up to a worrisome or superb heroine my sister who said something like we are going to have to talk about this before you head back to prevent another psychotic break pointing to her own heart</span>
<span class="depth-5">And I started to say in the dream as she tried to pull me through the sea-through marquee plastic transparent sheeting separating us two (the truss not made from wood this time, but iron jaws like mine were surgically shut and sucked in attenuated wage-abated warping time of all their wideness of the weft breath), even in my unconscious way back then just a few seconds ago when I had said:</span>
<span class="depth-5">C’mon sis can you pull me up, through</span>
<span class="depth-5">As I lay unable to move</span>
<span class="depth-5">And I said to her cheery encouragement,</span>

<span class="depth-6">Look down look down that lonesome road before you travel on</span>
<span class="depth-6">Look down</span>
<span class="depth-6">Looking down I see another small white feather</span>
<span class="depth-6">Much smaller than any others I had seen</span>
<span class="depth-6">And place it on that little knot that had become a shrine to what and who and why that I had been</span>
<span class="depth-6">And my minister, sister Rosetta’s voice rings out with greater resonance and quite a sibilance tingling only into my sinistral ear</span>
<span class="depth-6">Oh Tharpe, a harp, oh Newsom, my reel newton, how you’ve had my back to this tree and the tree replies silently for infinity for a second for the first and last time rest your weary head against the notes of pages of going staying staves of me my lonely little dove won’t you have one on me</span>

<span class="depth-7">Dressed in light</span>
<span class="depth-7">Not I</span>
<span class="depth-7">Knot eye</span>
<span class="depth-7">Staring into the centre of my spinal reed</span>
<span class="depth-7">Tapping rhythms tapping all my sap from seeds</span>
<span class="depth-7">I tried to sew to till the soil but oiled and dirty, filthy all I did was bleed</span>
<span class="depth-7">In biologically essentialist fallacy</span>
<span class="depth-7">Go a way don’t bee</span>
<span class="depth-7">Other</span>
<span class="depth-7">Me</span>
<span class="depth-7">I see a bee to the dextral entrance of the hospital (but perceived as sinister from the inside) calling me and I walk up to her and say you don’t want to go in there trust me</span>
<span class="depth-7">Trussed</span>
<span class="depth-7">Me</span>
<span class="depth-7">And now a scythe, reaping</span>
<span class="depth-7">I’m seeing death’s staff of hermetic secrecy</span>

<span class="depth-8">Look down I see</span>
<span class="depth-8">A divot in the lawn</span>
<span class="depth-8">Pecked by the crow just looking for</span>
<span class="depth-8">A nut</span>
<span class="depth-8">To crack</span>
<span class="depth-8">I make my sacred gesture</span>
<span class="depth-8">Left hand at the root of my backlit split once tale told now shrunk to tailbone crumbling down and old</span>
<span class="depth-8">Two fingers pointing downward palm faced back to back and down ward to the stone</span>
<span class="depth-8">And my right hand in a mirrored gesture is no longer at my heart or throat or even at the pituitary organ in the shadow of the unseen darkness where we all must see</span>
<span class="depth-8">But where it’s always belonged</span>
<span class="depth-8">Unlonging anymore</span>
<span class="depth-8">My other righted hand now risen at my crown where now must rest this feather</span>
<span class="depth-8">Weathered by such deathly storms</span>
<span class="depth-8">And blighted so unfrightened, strained neck straightened I implore</span>
<span class="depth-8">The heavens in my language unbeknownst to yore</span>
<span class="depth-8">Pointing upward from my crown, my crown, my crowning crown of risen wilted roses thorns</span>
<span class="depth-8">Between them like a pair of arms or armour or ammunition rounded or what’s more</span>
<span class="depth-8">A siren’s call, antenna</span>
<span class="depth-8">Of an insect or a radio</span>
<span class="depth-8">Telling felling visions that have down low been felt before</span>
<span class="depth-8">The leftmost bird (or right, I can’t remember now, i became much too absorbed)</span>
<span class="depth-8">Had landed on the upper eaves of this yellowing suggestion of a once White hospital door</span>
<span class="depth-8">While the other (dextral, sinister, divine) he or she stayed rooted on the floor</span>
<span class="depth-8">And between them, snug as a gun shot loud explosions through a skying silenced roar</span>
<span class="depth-8">Popping sonic barrier through bars of prism door</span>
<span class="depth-8">Flies right, to left</span>
<span class="depth-8">From arrow pointing stick right out of shoulder up and right to cross below the circle under ring</span>
<span class="depth-9">now staying grace, amazing me in place</span>
<span class="depth-9">I walked through the clearing</span>
<span class="depth-9">Clearing</span>
<span class="depth-9">Leering  of the trees this entrance now an exit from these ancestral historic future timeless chapel leaves</span>
<span class="depth-9">Don’t look back</span>
<span class="depth-9">Don’t look back I hear Eurydice siren emergency room eleven dark lit elven queen</span>
<span class="depth-9">Last evening after that failed attempt to impart a bedtime story</span>
<span class="depth-9">Oh how our pain now passed gets in the way of what’s here to be</span>
<span class="depth-9">I’d laid her down to rest again but kept her in her majesty</span>
<span class="depth-9">In central sump of supposition</span>
<span class="depth-9">Opposing no Body any More</span>
<span class="depth-9">But left, her crown it now points left</span>
<span class="depth-9">(But once I’m gone will return to her allocation of a whitest little squared up space, stripped of her witching craft I’m sure)</span>
<span class="depth-9">I bowed in turn, in turning, in missed turn of the barely hunted game now staler than the toast I melted butter under cafeteria light warm</span>
<span class="depth-9">And tried my best to spread it with a wooden palimpsest of a fork</span>
<span class="depth-9">A four-pronged branch</span>
<span class="depth-9">And out now, out back to the colder closing air</span>
<span class="depth-9">Two pigeons, my message to write this keep righting this keep fighting this by writing this</span>
<span class="depth-9">Two pigeons the left one fluttering a little forward a little more and then the right in response they’re trailing the shape of the caduceus</span>
