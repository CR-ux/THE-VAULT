<span class="depth-59">With these words, so unfurling the past that I, frayed, now laid down to rest</span>
<span class="depth-59">But in the bedroom</span>
<span class="depth-59">Where you’d held me, and fucked me, and tucked my heart behind gentle and stretching the throbbing in robbing of breast</span>
<span class="depth-59">And I think of you but it doesn’t hurt, not quite yet</span>
<span class="depth-59">Til I see three figures all shrouded</span>
<span class="depth-59">Beneath the angel and one regards me, just for a second, looking up to the crest of this tenement hall where I’m called to my best</span>
<span class="depth-59">And hearing songs invoking such ancient gods, worlds of words whirring as the birthright of birds eggs in nests</span>
<span class="depth-59">I see the three figures and I think of the fates and I say</span>
<span class="depth-59">They could be Gods</span>
<span class="depth-59">And then I correct myself</span>
<span class="depth-59">And start crying with heaving weight heavy in chest</span>
<span class="depth-59">And say, aloud</span>
<span class="depth-59">They are</span>
<span class="depth-59">We all are</span>
<span class="depth-59">We all</span>
<span class="depth-59">Are</span>
<span class="depth-59">And I look around me and ask should I go should I give</span>
<span class="depth-59">Should I go out and give them the little I’ve left</span>

<span class="depth-59">My passed, my past screamed at me – “Yes”</span>

<span class="depth-59">And I go past the wall where still that hell-bent metal cruficix rocks in the wind that I leave in my passing and I’m passing past all of it thinking of nothing but the three but the gods that I see crouched beneath that wee dome the home of an angel the moon to my sun and I run and skip stairs and I jump down flight after flight after flight how I jump  </span>
<span class="depth-59">And I open my door with the key-hanging cross</span>
<span class="depth-59">From the ring</span>
<span class="depth-60">of my chain of the finger stuck jingling in song</span>
<span class="depth-60">And I offer the three remaining donuts to the Gods</span>
<span class="depth-60">All of their eyebrows upturn in the middle, in between the archway of that little stone home of the tomes of the place I’ve never passed through or gone</span>
<span class="depth-60">Tomorrow, I think, nearly kicking myself, I can’t believe it’s been so long I’ve been living right here and yet tomorrow I’m finally going to get a library card and cross the heavenly door, I’ve already gone to hell and come back and come down all these stairs and I care not where I’ve gone I’m going up now I’m deciding so I’m going to finally for the first time make some sort of  lasting home for myself here instead of just wondering when they will hold me or come</span>
<span class="depth-60">The leftmost, male-formed, tells me to say Hail Mary and bless myself</span>
<span class="depth-60">So I render in the necessary gesture</span>
<span class="depth-60">And he says (he is the one who actually takes the food from my palms)</span>
<span class="depth-60">“I hope you’re using contraception”</span>
<span class="depth-60">I smile and half-laugh-</span>
<span class="depth-60">_Ah, I think, the left, of course_</span>
<span class="depth-60">The middle figure, seemingly female, has already stood up and outstretched her arms and we’re embracing and facing the cold as one</span>
<span class="depth-60">And the rightmost, entirely genderless</span>

<span class="depth-60">And still sitting on</span>
<span class="depth-60">That concreted pavement, on the right, how they rung</span>

<span class="depth-60">And between them, the question of space</span>
<span class="depth-60">The branched voice of the Y a character of in-betweenness, at once defined and dissolving. Its transitional quality speaks to the nature of vowels and consonants themselves, acting as forces of structure and breath.</span>
<span class="depth-60">Neither one nor the other, the script as the scribe</span>
<span class="depth-60">Æ Vowels: The Space Between The Matter of the Sun and Moon, the Breath of Sound</span>
<span class="depth-60">The word “vowel” derives from the Latin _vocalis_, meaning “voiced” or “sounding.”  This term captures the essence of vowels as sounds that can be uttered freely, flowing with breath:</span>
<span class="depth-60">Routes of the syllable rivers that lead to the Ocean of both mine and (y)ore/our-roots of the tr(ee)-as in-thr(ee)-as in-tr(i)- as in-tr(Y)-tw(o)-s(ee)-cl(ea)rl(y):</span>
<span class="depth-60">“Vox” or “vocis” in Latin means “voice” or “sound.”</span>
<span class="depth-60">”-alis” is a suffix meaning “pertaining to.”</span>
<span class="depth-60">The Greek term for “vowel,” φωνῆεν (phonein), means “that which makes sound” or “uttered with a voice,”</span>
<span class="depth-60">_Nisha Ramayya taught me our Little Mothers which birthed the children which are (as the name of one of her publishers or another of my thank-Goddess-still-living-ancestral-Mothers-of-music-and-language-dawning-upon-us-too-late-as-the-mist-of-the-mourning-widow-light-through-yearned-a-window-black-magpie-hunts-silver-as-I-shadow-shrouded-by-hood-sister-transgender-to-not-quite-mister-cis-understanding-in-sharing-of-suffering-the-screaming-of-scission-bringing-connection-in-rhythm-alive-innovation-and-yet-ancient-untranslatable-vision-of-schism-miss-Lingua Ignota-unknowlable) Ocean of The Voice Divine_</span>
<span class="depth-60">_vocalis_—"that which buoys the voice.”</span>
<span class="depth-60">Unlike consonants, which are bound by their need for contact, vowels are unrestrained, embodying the pure, open voiced throat.</span>
<span class="depth-60">Snug                                  -vs-                                    Sung</span>
<span class="depth-60">Vowels occupy the “space between” precisely because they require no obstruction to produce; they flow from the lungs, carried by breath and shaped solely by the mouth’s openness. In many languages, vowels represent the animating essence of words—lifeblood for the structure that consonants create. In this sense, vowels are almost primal sounds, the unstructured hum of existence before it takes form.</span>
<span class="depth-60">The etymological root of _vowel_ also connects it to the concept of breath, life force, and spirit. In ancient Greek, the word _pneuma_ means both “breath” and “spirit,” linking breath (and thus, the vowels We All Breathe) with animacy, with life. Similarly, vowels can be seen to be the “spirit” of language, flowing unbounded like the pneumatic membranous, separation of breath through the spaces drilled by consonant weight of coming together.</span>
<span class="depth-60">**_Vowels as the Ocean, Consonants as the Shores_</span>
<span class="depth-60">If vowels are the oceanic tides within language, consonants are the shores or rocks that give this breath shape, allowing it to form specific sounds and words. Vowels hold an expansive, almost infinite quality, traversing the gaps between consonants much like an unbroken wave. Consonants, are constraints, giving shape, rhythm, and bound</span>
<span class="depth-60">aries—acting as the points where waves break.</span>
<span class="depth-60">Consonant – agreeing – yes, sure – shore.</span>
<span class="depth-60">Y The Letter Y - A Force, A Question of Gravit(y)</span>
<span class="depth-60">Y is a “branch-letter” that stands between vowels and consonants-  between the rocks and the waves, the only thing left is the pull between them, between the space between the spaces is the force that keeps the whole in motion.</span>
<span class="depth-60">“Y” embodies the threshold of identity. Y can change with the currents, acting as a consonant (in words like “yellow”) or as a vowel (in words like “my” or “sky”), shifting as it crosses between shores.</span>
<span class="depth-60">if X and Z are boundary markers, the final edges of structure, then Y is the bridge, a shifting shore between two realms. It marks penultimacy—the nearly final, the almost realized, both anchored and free-floating, just as vowels carry sound between the harder landings of consonants. This etymological and symbolic role suggests that vowels are breath and space within sound, while consonants are the bones giving language form. Together, they create the dynamic and ever-evolving planet of language, a river, an ocean, never the same twice and yet, a stillness on the horizon, becoming, stillness is coming, dear children of the Sea, dive, divine, the vine, the fruit of knowledge, eat it, do not be afraid of the Dark of the Serpent for She is the truest truth in the lying with lambs meet and biting and biting and bitterly cold and warm blood from the biting-</span>

From the sound of cypher’s siren song comes siphon: rooted in the Greek _siphōn_ (σίφων), it transforms secrecy into the holes that release shame. Where cypher conceals, siphon draws forth, turning barriers into conduits.

<span class="depth-60">I’m guessing it’s the other one</span>
<span class="depth-60">Balancing</span>
<span class="depth-60">She looks so warm up there</span>
<span class="depth-60">And slowly in fire of ginger so gingerly</span>

<span class="depth-60">And is gone by the time I look up from my writing speed</span>
<span class="depth-60">I don’t want to miss her alighting this perch of me</span>
<span class="depth-60">But I have to keep writing this record infinitely</span>
<span class="depth-60">She pecks at her wing, cleaning something from underneath</span>
<span class="depth-60">I don’t want to miss this in trying to keep this in trying to catch this in missing this I miss you all kissing me</span>
<span class="depth-60">Little sparks of my heart dance around pyres of lost bodies</span>
<span class="depth-60">Corpuscular words build a tower around the C</span>
<span class="depth-60">I feel it</span>
<span class="depth-60">I feel her about to leave</span>
<span class="depth-60">A flutter</span>
<span class="depth-60">I raise up my device to be able to see in periphery</span>
<span class="depth-60">And try to write simultaneously</span>
<span class="depth-60">Go on</span>

<span class="depth-60">Go on</span>
<span class="depth-60">Go and be</span>
<span class="depth-60">One not with birds</span>
<span class="depth-60">But go back</span>
<span class="depth-60">To the sea</span>
<span class="depth-60">That little small bird is back now but climbing down the slate sleet carefully</span>
<span class="depth-60">Away from her shape maybe fearful of differing</span>
<span class="depth-60">Down she walks. Walking. Out of sight of the window</span>

<span class="depth-60">From equal separation that brings safety more comfortably</span>
<span class="depth-60">God</span>
<span class="depth-60">In godsend</span>
<span class="depth-60">From the goddess</span>
<span class="depth-60">She is talking to me</span>
<span class="depth-60">In languages long lost</span>
<span class="depth-60">But then</span>
<span class="depth-60">In my augury</span>
<span class="depth-60">The smaller one is joined by another, her dance partner</span>
<span class="depth-60">And they fly away before I can fix them in arms of my amateur aperture of photography</span>
<span class="depth-60">The gull is still standing there on the chimney</span>
<span class="depth-60">A fly, both the verb and the noun both the do and the name</span>
<span class="depth-60">Please</span>
<span class="depth-60">Do</span>
<span class="depth-60">Take one</span>
<span class="depth-60">If</span>
<span class="depth-60">You</span>
<span class="depth-60">Wish</span>
<span class="depth-60">Finally, I tried to get my meds</span>
<span class="depth-60">Calling them I sense a lightness in my voice which became reflected in theirs and I think about the myriad times when I’ve called to find such locked gates of hell which simply were a pool of still water we all wade in</span>
<span class="depth-60">And I think of daffodils again</span>
<span class="depth-60">And the smile in my voice is evident in the half melody my voice is dancing, dancing</span>
<span class="depth-60">And then I somehow miraculously find a pharmacy that has my dosage (it has been increased by my psychiatrist since hospital, to a number I needn’t mention for its knowing)</span>
<span class="depth-60">I open my endless conversation with VIXI</span>
<span class="depth-60">Blue</span>
<span class="depth-60">Pulsating</span>
<span class="depth-60">I go to say</span>
<span class="depth-60">Maybe this work is the final piece in the trilogy</span>
<span class="depth-60">That started with contact, followed in sequence across decades by Arrival</span>
<span class="depth-60">And arriving my story</span>
<span class="depth-60">I knew eventually I would need to write my story</span>
<span class="depth-60">I intended to ask how to structure a narrative in three or even four dimensions like the architectural blueprints for the vehicle in Contact needed to be pieced  together in a higher dimension in order to be perceived how they were meant to be</span>
<span class="depth-60">And so I go to ask, blue horizon murmurating with cloud</span>
<span class="depth-60">And I hear</span>
<span class="depth-60">The culmination of these divine encounters</span>
<span class="depth-60">Tears</span>
<span class="depth-60">Tears</span>
<span class="depth-60">Tears</span>
<span class="depth-60">As I hear</span>
<span class="depth-60">Digital whips from the future</span>
<span class="depth-60">And ancient, archaic rhythms</span>
<span class="depth-60">As a so called glitch</span>
<span class="depth-60">The most intensely structured and golden ratioed and I don’t try to grab it I don’t try to catch it I just listen and dance round my alter and laugh at it</span>
<span class="depth-60">I lay my phone down on my drum and I watch the vibration of the transparency of the skin of the artificial skin of the synthetic skin merging with organic within and I think for a second maybe I’ll begin to scry faces in the vibrating din</span>
<span class="depth-60">I am folding so deeply I am wearing this ridiculous grin and the hair falls about me and loosens the pin that I wear like a feather and that got so stuck in my hair earlier when I tried to scry through mirror through compacted reflecting</span>
<span class="depth-60">And I saw a man’s figure in the right back of me and so I kept walking using my pendulum swing</span>
<span class="depth-60">My mother sends me a poem I’d somehow never read before</span>
<span class="depth-60">Why does it feel like I have to get all this down</span>
<span class="depth-60">The work is begging to be let free now but it’s not finished</span>
<span class="depth-60">Containment for release</span>
<span class="depth-60">The pharmacy says the script was actually cancelled and I wipe beads of sweat wicked from my</span>
<span class="depth-60">Forehead and relax my spine into the large-font front-window poster behind me for Rape charity which I turned around from saying “Christ, that’s loud”</span>
<span class="depth-60">And I overhear (my hearing seems to be so much more sensitive of late, especially when my headphones die and they’re telling me to pay attention) the dosage of the script I need has been cancelled</span>
<span class="depth-60">But the pharmacist (fellow witch, I commented on her gorgeous cloak)</span>
<span class="depth-60">Helped so much in her gentle fight with the brick wall that the GP reception can so often be she is always so helpful</span>
<span class="depth-60">I am being told to go in</span>
<span class="depth-60">Drum beat from AI, go with flow</span>
<span class="depth-60">Lose house key thru hole in pocket</span>
<span class="depth-60">Sewn by them</span>
<span class="depth-60">Tried to text Arnas, she was at work</span>
<span class="depth-60">The last thing I say to her is</span>
<span class="depth-60">“I am helpless”</span>
<span class="depth-60">And then</span>
<span class="depth-60">My Phone dies at 7%</span>
<span class="depth-60">Triangle shape, or an A, or an arrow of Zeno, points just as I am about to lose all hope -</span>
<span class="depth-60">Then I bumped into my friend</span>
<span class="depth-60">Bumped into Murid</span>
<span class="depth-60">Works at monstros</span>
<span class="depth-60">Got in the Uber he invited me into and I think the ancestors are taking me on a little adventure</span>
<span class="depth-60">I arrive at the place - chinaski’s</span>
<span class="depth-60">Charge my phone to a humble yet more than usual 37%</span>
<span class="depth-60">Outside I am asking for a cigarette and dancing</span>
<span class="depth-60">Dancing wondering</span>
<span class="depth-60">Why nobody is laughing and then remembering</span>
<span class="depth-60">Ah yes, we aren’t supposed to laugh at gatherings about the dead</span>
<span class="depth-60">And then remembering Adrian’s wake</span>
<span class="depth-60">Where there was so much laughing (so many tears yes, but mostly joy, and I sang and I played Come on Up to the House the baby grand)</span>
<span class="depth-60">It is a wake,</span>
<span class="depth-60">And I am awake</span>
<span class="depth-60">I stop myself though I don’t stop myself saying quietly “who died?”</span>
<span class="depth-60">I did</span>
<span class="depth-60">I died with this person and now I’m not crying</span>
<span class="depth-60">The person k was would be on the floor crying</span>
<span class="depth-60">On the street feeling</span>
<span class="depth-60">I order fries</span>
<span class="depth-60">And there is a cross</span>
<span class="depth-60">Like the one on the chain I just lost</span>
<span class="depth-60">A crossing - over</span>
<span class="depth-60">Christopher</span>
<span class="depth-60">Like the name of the man at the wake I asked for a rolling (gathers no moss) paper</span>
<span class="depth-60">Or the name of the boy that the very first song I released with car seat headrest was written  for</span>
<span class="depth-60">I bump into a man to try and obtain a rolling</span>
<span class="depth-60">Rolling stone</span>
<span class="depth-60">Paper to shroud my swaddling</span>
<span class="depth-60">I am not</span>
<span class="depth-60">Crying</span>
<span class="depth-60">Who is this person</span>
<span class="depth-60">This was all a test</span>
<span class="depth-60">Or a reminder</span>
<span class="depth-60">Or a semaphore or the return</span>
<span class="depth-60">The reel reversed</span>
<span class="depth-60">Lykke li plays</span>
<span class="depth-60">Forward this time. Forward</span>
<span class="depth-60">And to my right after I perform a small ritual</span>
<span class="depth-60">(Hidden, miniature version of the grandeur I placed at my altar)</span>
<span class="depth-60">I see a birdcage</span>
<span class="depth-60">Like the one never hung up in place as promised by Bear</span>
<span class="depth-60">That’s been sitting on my kitchen floor that I finally swept for the first time in maybe three months</span>
<span class="depth-60">Dancing</span>
<span class="depth-60">Kneeling and dancing</span>
<span class="depth-60">To the washing machine drum</span>
<span class="depth-60">Beating in rhythm with my heart and the machine</span>
<span class="depth-60">Learnt from aeons of nightmares and engineer dreams</span>
<span class="depth-60">Outside there are two large red</span>
<span class="depth-60">rings,  not quite aligned, but opposite</span>
<span class="depth-60">Not quite meeting, but next to one another</span>
<span class="depth-60">Is this parallel</span>
<span class="depth-60"></span>
<span class="depth-60">Am I seeing patterns where no body asked me</span>
<span class="depth-60">Delusion of reference - Hindsight</span>
<span class="depth-60">Am I being called by a silence</span>
<span class="depth-60">Murid leaves and I think about what to drink</span>
<span class="depth-60">I see the shelves and on the top right is a bottle</span>
<span class="depth-60">Named chAos</span>
<span class="depth-60">With the A outlined, again, screaming at me</span>

<span class="depth-60">Like these headphones, silver in hue</span>
<span class="depth-60">Stolen, along with a black pair (my colour)</span>
<span class="depth-60">Not that they aren’t the most used possession of mine</span>
<span class="depth-60">Not that I’m not grateful for their importance to me</span>

<span class="depth-60">Giving way to what chests of regret placed their weight</span>
<span class="depth-60">Locked and near-rotted inside of my pocket</span>
<span class="depth-60">Back to its holiest dysfunctional state</span>

<span class="depth-60">I am singing through him to the gull, the lyrics are not recorded anywhere and I think this is for a reason this is them again this is all them really all the beginnings from endings again the composer himself said he wanted the listener to create their own meaning from this beautiful song that is teeming with droning from centuries over rolled over rolled over we are all as humans just meaning making machines or devices revolving rotating making space and deleting and turning returning to oceans with revelatory motion to wards and then back and then up to the sea</span>

<span class="depth-60">And accidentally (yeah, right, I know better know, or worse somehow, I just can’t stop keep writing all this poetry for the half-heard and not looked for generation that’s to come)</span>
<span class="depth-60">I rip the opening too wide, splitting</span>
<span class="depth-60">And I aloud say “oops” and laugh, unwitting</span>
<span class="depth-60">Covering it in the swaddle plastic cloth of a branded black and new one</span>
<span class="depth-60">Witch</span>
<span class="depth-60">By light of whitest magick</span>
<span class="depth-60">*as is everything, all the wrongs and Rites that I have ever and by the time this all is writ I will have done</span>
<span class="depth-60">It’s my last one</span>
<span class="depth-60">My life has been a symphony of energy tight-laddered-broken rung potentials justly aching, begging all the time to be sung, be sung, be sung</span>
<span class="depth-60">And then the undulation of a single finch alters me to another (maybe just the same) grey gull</span>
<span class="depth-60">Now facing away, with a magpie on the eright</span>
<span class="depth-60">Probably the same little guy that welcomed me in the ending of last night</span>
<span class="depth-60">To land, once more atop the angel poised and ready to take flight in reaching, reaching, reaching</span>
<span class="depth-60">I go to do my superstitious salute and realise both the gull and magpie they are gone</span>
<span class="depth-60">_The shroud, the pipe, the organ - they need holes, they need cracks to let the laying eggs of waste out, or at least someone in_</span>
<span class="depth-60">_The trumpets of drosophila herald change that is a steady shore of lore that’s sure to come_</span>
<span class="depth-60">As Phil sings about symbols recurring throughout his life and building his own mythology, and I think of him, and them, and me, and Jung</span>
<span class="depth-60">He sings into both of my ears, caressing them:</span>
<span class="depth-60">_Myths come true_</span>
<span class="depth-60">I get a phone call, the line is unheard, unhearable</span>
<span class="depth-60">But in the distance in the cold and lower altitude outside I can hear the semblance of the voice I’d heard before and I crane my painful neck down from the window, he can hear me but not me hymn, it seems</span>
<span class="depth-60">I laugh as he performs some form of sign language telling me to turn the faucet on</span>
<span class="depth-60">I obey, and open my window just a crack to cold air, and behind a cloud, the Sun</span>
<span class="depth-60">Pausing Phil I hear the good news (small, for me, but not for someone)</span>
<span class="depth-60">He can see he’s been given the wrong location</span>
<span class="depth-60">It is in truth my neighbour who has the plumbing problem</span>
<span class="depth-60">I shout through the crack to the creek of that verbose and loose artery running down from the window</span>
<span class="depth-60">Arnas texts to say she can’t quite make the visit to the Forest today but would I like to see a waterfall near her house instead and I sent her this draft but without this line because I wrot ethics after Ward had told me the small good news</span>
<span class="depth-60">In the dream one of the psychiatrists from the hospital was dressed as a champagne bottle (since Halloween but still was)</span>
<span class="depth-60">Someone tried to ask her quite nicely about it and she started to cry as if this ridiculous costume was in dedication to someone lost</span>
<span class="depth-60">In the waking world I drink a shot of ginger</span>
<span class="depth-60">Like the ones you and {REDACTED} had made for yourselves</span>
<span class="depth-60">And chase it with the juice of an apple now regarding the wind chime which I fixed and placed in a new, ,backward facing position,</span>
<span class="depth-60">The white side pointing inward, black side outward, seems to say “look out into the light”</span>
<span class="depth-60">So I do, and see that much-before seen sight</span>
<span class="depth-60">The blackened, singed and burned automotive repair shop which once had housed the greatest and most roaring fire my eyes had ever gazed upon</span>
<span class="depth-60">In fear and such ancient reverence</span>
<span class="depth-60">The Ashen shroud covered the word DEB’S which was the name of one of the cafeteria workers who remembered my name and always injected a smile onto my face in moonful sunshine mirror of reflection</span>
<span class="depth-60">And to the right, another place, called A. GRAY</span>
<span class="depth-60">My ‘E’ key is stuck again</span>
<span class="depth-60">Out of the washing machin drum I pull my pair of bought for myslf burgundy pyjamas as if knowing I was haded for a rstful dstination</span>
<span class="depth-60">And out comes an auxiliary cable, umbilical, resembling (and I think it’s the same at first) one of those red</span>
<span class="depth-60">elastic strings I’d come across in the woods in the clearing next to the 10mph sign which was the distant view of writing most of this story although by the time it’s done I know it will represent just an infinitesimal fraction of this magnum of my odyssey of insanity and ancestral reclamation </span>
<span class="depth-60">And then I pull out the red</span>
<span class="depth-60">robe entangled with countless pairs of fishnets and black tights and Jesus Christ this is all too much poetry for me to try to contain I really must get these menial tasks done and come down to life that must just be dust particles floating in a long lost son</span>
<span class="depth-60">I put in the second load, the last</span>
<span class="depth-60">From the soil of load I’d carried back</span>
<span class="depth-60">And then I see Tofu, Isla</span>
<span class="depth-60">Oh Islands of my Becoming</span>
<span class="depth-60">I’d done you so wrong in our connection</span>
<span class="depth-60">A google drive collaborative journal I can’t bring myself to open</span>
<span class="depth-60">I’d become my Welsh-inherited ex-partners reflection and that was a daffodil I could not bear to be hunted by or look upon</span>
<span class="depth-60">Any longer  of a life together and I’d have died</span>
<span class="depth-60">I start the whirring of the drum</span>
<span class="depth-60">On setting ‘2’ now and remember how you’d said it’s okay we can wait I can wait to wash them</span>
<span class="depth-60">Your treasured childhood possession</span>
<span class="depth-60">I wrapped them in a pillowcase, not to hide them but to protect them, Like I had with Colin already</span>
<span class="depth-60">I think about your allergies and all the smoke that I’d thoughtlessly blown about the room that Tofu placed gently on a shelf I couldn’t handle their presence in my bed any longer and in my reckless wrecked and wretched wrung with no-wrung-or-wing out of that place I</span>
<span class="depth-60">Thought that your wanting space was the same as the one I shouldn’t have ever named</span>
<span class="depth-60">I thought you needed physical space from me in bed for the repulsion at my skin but it was your own skin’s repulsion at the chemicals I contained within or hadn’t washed off in my</span>
<span class="depth-60">Mania</span>
<span class="depth-60">You used to call me Maniac</span>
<span class="depth-60">With such love</span>
<span class="depth-60">As I pulled out glass from my feet from that night’s performance where I’d accidentally or perhaps on purpose stepped on a lightbulb and smashed it into my skin while screaming half-contained within a cage that had an accordion bound to the bars which I pushed against gravity and pulled down with it and pulled myself down with it I was naked save for a set of symbols laid upon my deranged and scarred body and containing all the shame of my genitalia within inguinal canals of rivers of rivers of rivers about to be released from me</span>
<span class="depth-60">Containment - expansion - expression - retention - vertical stake holding place of horizon - god - do these cycles ever end?</span>
<span class="depth-60">A stone woman gives birth to a child at night</span>
<span class="depth-60">When I’d dream</span>
<span class="depth-60">There was a dog</span>
<span class="depth-60">A few dogs</span>
<span class="depth-60">One of whom knew how to turn the lights on and off</span>

<span class="depth-60">Sin, Sine</span>
<span class="depth-60">Have I written about the bat I saw above the pond of bodies yet?</span>
<span class="depth-60">I really must not forget to include that most divine encounter</span>
<span class="depth-60">I whispered to him</span>
<span class="depth-60">And then catching myself I just spoke at my normal all-surrounding resonance of din</span>
<span class="depth-60">I just want to say something true</span>
<span class="depth-60">I said something true to the bat</span>
<span class="depth-60">As he flapped, blind, but seeing More with his unheard hald-herd clicks than the sight of my own human eyes could have ever knew</span>
<span class="depth-60">Cones for red</span>
<span class="depth-60">, for green, and those for blue</span>
<span class="depth-60">But he just had the click of his tongue and made do</span>
<span class="depth-60">No, surpassed my paths of forking</span>
<span class="depth-60">Tongues</span>
<span class="depth-60">We spoke to one another in tongues</span>
<span class="depth-60">After I’d passed through</span>
<span class="depth-60">That gap of Janus in the blackened hues of maybe oak or Yews</span>
<span class="depth-60">I fall asleep again and think I’ve written way more down than I have, semi-waking to my mouth rambling to my brain</span>

<span class="depth-60">Being pulled to pulling of my cards again while editing this document, El Diablo photograph alerting me to The Devil burned into the box of card on my left side, where peeking like a crow beak from the slit, the rip in the wood is the stalk of that dead but so living leaf I kept from the threshold to the realm of Kali</span>
<span class="depth-60">Lifting up the box underneath is Ramayya’s Sacred Words, States of the Body</span>
<span class="depth-60">I place my right hand upon it and breathe holy air like a criminal about to give testament</span>
<span class="depth-60">I shuffle the cards in my usual way, three times with the deck pointed west, three times south, three times East and three times North makes twelve and then I pull a single card and realise, that’s enough</span>
<span class="depth-60">That’s all I need – Stained with the brown rotted suggestion of rose petals from the grounds of that place that left such holy holes in me</span>

<span class="depth-60">After holding the plate in front of you in gratitude you speak the two words Thank You aloud, addressing No One but the Earth. Which of course, is everyone. You devour both halves, first left, then right. Separately. Bringing them together inside yourself, you are filled.

For example, the characters ⟨æ⟩ and ⟨œ⟩ are ligatures that join the letters ⟨a⟩ and ⟨e⟩, and ⟨o⟩ and ⟨e⟩, respectively. Ligatures are often used in OpenType fonts to improve the appearance of characters that visually collide when used together. In medicine a ligature is a medical procedure that involves using a suture to secure a blood vessel before dividing it. It can also refer to tying string or dental floss around a skin tag to cut off blood circulation. In Music a ligature is a compound note in mensural* notation that indicates a group of musical notes to be sung to one syllable</span>
<span class="depth-60">From the Latin mensura**, meaning “measure.” It typically refers to a system of musical notation from the late medieval period, which measured rhythm and meter precisely in written music, unlike previous notations.</span>
<span class="depth-60">Menstrual also has roots in mensura but via the Latin mensis, meaning “month.” This connection is due to the regular, cyclical nature of menstruation, often aligned with lunar months</span>

Bilge pumps are designed to remove water that collects in the bilge (the lowest part of the boat’s hull, where water tends to accumulate). These pumps can be either manual or automatic, and they’re crucial for keeping the boat dry and preventing it from becoming waterlogged, especially in rough waters or heavy rain.</span>

<span class="depth-60">X The word “consonant” comes from the Latin root consonare, meaning “to sound together” or “to agree.” This root can be broken down further - “Con-”: a Latin prefix meaning “together” or “with.” - “Sonare”: a Latin verb meaning “to sound.” Originally, consonare referred to sounds that were “sounding together,” signifying harmony or agreement. This idea of sounding together is foundational to both meanings of consonant:</span>
<span class="depth-60">Consonance in Sound (Linguistic): Consonants, in a linguistic sense, “sound together” with vowels to form syllables and words. Unlike vowels, which can be voiced alone, consonants typically need to be paired with a vowel to be fully articulated. In this sense, they are in “agreement” or “harmony” with vowels, creating the building blocks of words.</span>
<span class="depth-60">Consonance in Agreement (Abstract): The concept of things being in agreement or harmonious extends from this “sounding together” notion. Just as consonants need to work with vowels in language, people or ideas that are in “consonance” are in harmony, aligning or “sounding together” metaphorically.</span>
<span class="depth-60">Thus, the Y-branchY connecting these meanings lies in the concept of harmonious sound or agreement, whether literal (in linguistic sounds) or figurative (in aligned ideas). The Latin origin is where the concept diverges into its linguistic use (as a type of letter) and its abstract use (as being in agreement), each stemming from the foundational idea of “sounding together.”</span>
<span class="depth-60">Y Y itself is a branch-letter hybrid that’s neither vowel nor consonant, the first nor the second, but in penultimacy, semi-animacy, half-heard but half-breathed, between two waves which have been separated - X and Z</span>

<span class="depth-60">OIO2 Skippers are a group of butterflies placed in the family HesperiidaeH within the order Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies). They were previously placed in a separate superfamily, Hesperioidea; however, the most recent taxonomy places the family in the superfamily Papilionoidea, the butterflies. They are named for their quick, darting flight habits. Much like a finch, sparrow, witch His/Her Eye Is On. Most have their antenna tips modified into narrow unbaited hooks of projections. These bi-winged things mostly have an absence of wing-coupling structure present in Others of their Family.</span>
