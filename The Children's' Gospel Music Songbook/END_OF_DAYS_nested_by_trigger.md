<span class="depth-5">Picturing faces of her and of me and you (never meant to B for {REDACTED})</span>
<span class="depth-5">Mid framing pictures in reels of tape waking in two parts of you</span>
<span class="depth-5">Dreaming in part of me dreaming in part of you</span>
<span class="depth-5">I dreamt of a wedding and my sister was there with me watching you</span>
<span class="depth-5">Two at a table another far too close and too far from you</span>
<span class="depth-5">I dreamt of a wedding of two friends of the two of you</span>
<span class="depth-5">Were wearing a joker’s (like decks of cards or comic book) suit</span>
<span class="depth-5">And I confronted you she said not a word but you were so cruel and I said fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you and I looked at you both and said fuck you fuck you yes the both of you</span>
<span class="depth-5">Awkwardly leaving the celebrating people of the party quite starkly and stylelessly messy and loudly announced</span>
<span class="depth-5">I watch a clock ticking down in my bank account</span>
<span class="depth-5">And Lauren she was pulling me through a space in a railing and I had become paralysed explaining the pain of you parts of you left lame and tangled inside of who I thought I was now left there on the dance floor barefoot next to shoe after shoe paired with shoes upon shoes upon shores so floor-crawling brawling lapped like dogs of hounding hellish waves with crests and fledgling ending spring chicken breasts of such unrest the rest of those awful unbearably boring and bored hole cunt wedding guests thank goddess her dress was blue showing me it’s not your wedding but it could have been sitting on that smoke-stained Edinburgh sofa you, standing, asked me what I thought of asking her to marry you in the first few months of what fumbling nonsense the never us was and on the phone weeping years later her saying in such resolved consolation they’ll never marry me but I knew what you had asked me and that one day I’d have to be leaving all this mess$ or be left bereft betraying me and all my inheld-input-put-back-on-the-shelves to collect dust-to-dust-to-must-just-be-all-a one day all this smelly-eggless-cracked-with-cress-and-opened-chest-and-sandwiched-body-in-that-bed-for-three-for-you-and-her-but-not-for-me-and-my-too-wet-sweat-getting-used-to-estrogen-hormonal-balance-acting-like-this-all-was-okay-soaking-corpse-turned-over-ovumless could be you but never us but at least I tried through untrusting and trussed unease almost dying as I pushed through the trails of the dust and in rage of the reigning wrath inside you just is the storm of the</span>
<span class="depth-5">I was half-pulled through the gap in a bannister like the gap in the bed bunk in game my sister and I would play nightly when we were bored and sleep was evading us hating the sound of such counting of sheep but I used to pull Lauren by leg through the space in between the wood planks I remember her saying just give me a chance to turn my face sideways so my chin doesn’t get stuck and I make it through luckily she always managed to unscathed as I’d giggle impatient like some small demon or devil on the BottomBB bunk merely four years younger than she was this angel who’d happily risk her own pain for my laughing but in the dream I was the one being dragged not down to a non-sorry supervillain’s laughter but up to a worrisome or superb heroine my sister who said something like we are going to have to talk about this before you head back to prevent another psychotic break pointing to her own heart</span>
<span class="depth-5">And I started to say in the dream as she tried to pull me through the sea-through marquee plastic transparent sheeting separating us two (the truss not made from wood this time, but iron jaws like mine were surgically shut and sucked in attenuated wage-abated warping time of all their wideness of the weft breath), even in my unconscious way back then just a few seconds ago when I had said:</span>
<span class="depth-5">C’mon sis can you pull me up, through</span>
<span class="depth-5">As I lay unable to move</span>
<span class="depth-5">And I said to her cheery encouragement,</span>

<span class="depth-10">Seeing in my absence of a turning to the turning of the once again black stuttering of this Mark of dark black not-matte Richness leaving as a mirror</span>
<span class="depth-10">Two magpies dancing, no need to use their wings</span>
<span class="depth-10">Around the front and back of a squirrel as if trying to provide a sense of ease for him</span>
<span class="depth-10">Their black and whiteness screaming either side of boba eyes and bushy tail</span>
<span class="depth-10">How I miss you</span>
<span class="depth-10">And I wander through the cracks of this eroding picnic bench again</span>
<span class="depth-10">Not the one beneath you, Adrian (I promised you that tearful stab of penultimation was my final greeting)</span>
<span class="depth-10">But the one right in front of these nine hellish gates</span>
<span class="depth-10">I ponder, wandering</span>
<span class="depth-10">This place should have a pond although I understand why it’s missing</span>

<span class="depth-10">One message I received from you for the entirety of my stay, or leave</span>
<span class="depth-10">Asking for consent</span>
<span class="depth-10">You sent a message</span>
<span class="depth-10">What a mess</span>
<span class="depth-10">And how I’ve aged into a shrinking oldness</span>
<span class="depth-10">You</span>
<span class="depth-10">Us three</span>
<span class="depth-10">Back then (my goddess, how it seems a previous carnation wilted bookshelf of unlived life again)</span>
<span class="depth-10">This whole thing has just been poetry</span>
<span class="depth-10">Quite funny, really, in its tragedy</span>
<span class="depth-10">Thinking, as is much the case of late, of etymology</span>
<span class="depth-10">Like a healthy distant way to process what you meant</span>
<span class="depth-10">And what that meant</span>
<span class="depth-10">That usage of your leg as severing implement</span>
<span class="depth-10">And then, as if a nail in coughing nurse hid ‘hind a mask of black with pepperminted scent from oil she told us helped her remedy her allergies to dust and soil and seeking seeds of pollen</span>
<span class="depth-10">Thinking of the final meeting with Dr Shanahan, where I’d said</span>
<span class="depth-10">My little thoughts on the biggest book I’ve ever read</span>
<span class="depth-10">How death should be considered as a widow or a long forgotten friend with will</span>
<span class="depth-10">And then just now and then and now I thought of JK Rowling</span>
<span class="depth-10">And any of the women who create as clouds of reigning over my hopeful extinction</span>
<span class="depth-10">How through different believing, such sparring sparrows speaking difference</span>
<span class="depth-10">Same tongue, same place. Same soul, voice/face</span>

<span class="depth-11">Not wind itself’s expression but impressions that it leaves</span>
<span class="depth-11">Upon the fallen leaves</span>
<span class="depth-11">And leaving, like a sulking child bestows the bag an open grave</span>
<span class="depth-11">No dignity or grace or urn for its returning to the wave</span>
<span class="depth-11">I try to open that once first lasting poem I still know by heart but wanted to be sure of my retelling of this memory but neither google chrome nor Adam’s eave dropped Lilith Apple timecrunching browsing roused safari seemed to load the words as I pressed the so oft pressured by my now-clean left indexing finger so I went outside to breathe</span>
<span class="depth-11">But upon my returning the moriae had decided now, it was the time to share this little piece of childhood with this woman whose opinion of me I still was so unsure</span>
<span class="depth-11">I tentatively take off aegis headphones leaving my clipped on shades (which had bent but fixed my self two hours prior) secure</span>
<span class="depth-11">And say to her</span>
<span class="depth-11">I’m sorry for interrupting your break,</span>
<span class="depth-11">But your name-</span>
<span class="depth-11">It’s been reminding me of this poem from the poems on the Underground, a collection of my very first beloved words during a much much younger visit to the Big Smoke (way before</span>
<span class="depth-11">I’d come to smallness of my own smoke-choking raw)</span>
<span class="depth-11">Could i share it with you? It’s title seems to be a sign that Now is right -</span>
<span class="depth-11">I still do not know if she had been perturbed by my playing the piano in the chapel, but with my leaving imminent it didn’t matter, shaking me, she said:</span>
<span class="depth-11">“Oh darling, sure”</span>
<span class="depth-11">￼</span>
<span class="depth-11">Sitting down in seventeen</span>
<span class="depth-11">I’ve written notes to mostly everyone</span>
<span class="depth-11">Now’s the time to sing</span>
<span class="depth-11">I stuck together two of the verdant cards cut into shapes of leaves</span>
<span class="depth-11">I wonder if this homonymous morphology was purposeful and there in that much trodden corridor I thought “it is, I will just choose to believe”</span>
<span class="depth-11">Be leave</span>
<span class="depth-11">And in the goddess of the spine, the knot-yet peeling-glue to hold together, healing, hurting everything</span>
<span class="depth-11">I stuck a sticker of my past and now passed merchandising</span>
<span class="depth-11">My visage of Arachne, my darkness debutante eight legged thing</span>
<span class="depth-11">Walking down the hall I’d come to not-knot-rot-now-know, a child again, I was flapping that little despair dissipating air-craft avian facsimile</span>
<span class="depth-11">Waving it pretending it really was like me, a bird</span>
<span class="depth-11">Just longing to be flying somewhere smelt and breathed like home to me</span>
<span class="depth-11">Nobody passed me as I made this infantile free gesture</span>
<span class="depth-11">Smiling at the silly thing I’d made, I farewell blessed her</span>
<span class="depth-11">And searching for a glue-dot or quiet tape we weren’t a loud here</span>
<span class="depth-11">The HCA suggested I use a sticky label for refrigerated foodstuffs stuffed and stacked and packed into the frigid-left-right-centre</span>
<span class="depth-11">So wrapping it around itself and thinking of a nest or heart or any imperfection of suggestion of a circle</span>
<span class="depth-11">Cross-sectioned vivisected into infinite dimensions, making stone from sticky hollowness of little symbol cylinder</span>
<span class="depth-11">I placed her in the middle, like a sparrow now to exit</span>
<span class="depth-11">And I think there was it</span>
<span class="depth-11">When I decided in my Own Way, I had covered, reckoned with</span>
<span class="depth-11">Tentative remembrance of recovery or whatever wellsprung meaning any place like this could give</span>
<span class="depth-11">Arachne's silk - thread - weave - whirling devilish and dervishly - sing melodies- aria - DNA - Ariadne's thread, red</span>
<span class="depth-12">- labyrinthine sign to exit - read - book - spinal syrinx like a clarinet reed - basket encased by the reeds - river flows through to leaves once stuck - now freed - together - leaves - leaving with a load too heavy - but there inside a light - now out lit behind sight - don't look back - lot's black widow turning into a - salt - battery - charge - for - telephonic - phoenix - messaging - a beacon - ward - 'goodbye messages to the ward' - guard - garden wing - a bird - a beak - that chirps - that sings - that comes back home cold and older but within the tangled mess - still buttressed - buttered toast for dinner - thinner - strung out - stitched with symbols deep within - the word is everything - the script, the scripture, halved to whole - holes of the holy text - textile - swaddled by ancestral warmth of living and departed coven - woven tapestry - gold weight led to alchemy - delicate but strong, a spun return to Selfhood, red</span>
<span class="depth-13">riddle of forgotten gift - no lift but lifted - ascent - a sending way back home to Arachne</span>
<span class="depth-13">And on the upturned symbols of the mulching season (two, I picked up two for such a reason)</span>
<span class="depth-13">I wrote that most verbose but much too short (like life) quote by T S Eliot</span>
<span class="depth-13"></span>
<span class="depth-13">And hoped that in my hurt returning I had learned enough to know the place</span>
<span class="depth-13">Why are we so quick to pathologise pain?</span>

<span class="depth-13">Try to separate difference, you’ll find you cannot, like a Damocles blade cannot rain</span>
<span class="depth-13">though it seems so dendritic, it’s all just the same-</span>
<span class="depth-13">The face of voiceless echoing of almost-burning down up from lacing of the broken sole-cloven shoes I cannot use that cleaning staff will find while I trace lines of all my fallen left waiting</span>
<span class="depth-13">Weighting north to find me</span>
<span class="depth-13">Not behind me at all</span>
<span class="depth-13">But calling forth, a bridge</span>
<span class="depth-13">A biting, rung-writ midge</span>

<span class="depth-13">Landing just then on my right wrist</span>
<span class="depth-13">Just whispering so gently in suggestion to open my fist</span>
<span class="depth-13">So I obey her, and away she flutters</span>

<span class="depth-15">She asks if I need my stuff from out of my locker and offers to get it for me</span>
<span class="depth-15">I say, calmness washing over me</span>
<span class="depth-15">I can see in the depth of her eyes, like those three, darting sense of shared relief</span>
<span class="depth-15">I say no, you get home and rest and I’ll get my things after therapy</span>
<span class="depth-15">She shakes my hand and says please</span>
<span class="depth-15">Look after yourself, you’re very special</span>
<span class="depth-15">I say</span>
<span class="depth-15">Mirror</span>
<span class="depth-15">Hold my hand up, smiling</span>
<span class="depth-15">She says mirror back, while flipping her palm round as if a secret bookshelf entrance behind which lie tales too gory but still poured over by my letter-hungry eyes while I was still so small</span>
<span class="depth-15">And then my final words to her (I think, for just a second which resounds out through all these hallowed halls - of both our deaths)</span>
<span class="depth-15">Mirror mirror on the wall</span>
<span class="depth-15">And she laughed, I think it shimmered in sincerity</span>
<span class="depth-15">We spoke of TS as in Transsexual and as in T.S. Eliot</span>

<span class="depth-16">Out, out into the opener air</span>
<span class="depth-16">I see some acquaintances I’d met at the picnic bench in passing</span>
<span class="depth-16">Mewing their sympathetic tones of Oh! You Are Going?</span>
<span class="depth-16">And, as if possessed by a future self I never thought could be but one told would emerge eventually</span>
<span class="depth-16">I asserted boundaries</span>
<span class="depth-16">This unkempt Fire saying “Yes, but I hate goodbyes, and all these things I have to carry just so heavy, so I’m just going to stay over here”</span>
<span class="depth-16">And whether they were offended or respected this (to me) impressively (maybe selfish, oh well) gesture, their responses I just did not hear</span>
<span class="depth-16">Gospel music it was grinning artefactual divinity left right through Pinnas into spirals in my inner ear</span>
<span class="depth-16">Like a dog, laying itself to rest, checking to make sure</span>
<span class="depth-16">It wasn’t crushing any insects</span>
<span class="depth-16">As an ascetic, a monk, or particularly manic monkey (though the planar movement rotated right-angled by approximately ninety degrees  </span>
<span class="depth-16">In engagement with the motion of the ravenously cavernous spore-orbit of a Ring</span>

<span class="depth-18">On the first train there was no seat</span>
<span class="depth-18">I can’t sit down</span>

<span class="depth-18">With a satchel of pharmaco chemical messengers I-</span>
<span class="depth-18">Ah</span>
<span class="depth-18">A quartet of rest, where I for seven sedimentary minutes I can sink my case for leagues on leagues of upcoming expenditure of energy</span>

<span class="depth-18">Somehow on the tube</span>
<span class="depth-18">I could have sworn this journey should have been a palindrome and yet</span>
<span class="depth-18">Even with my right shoulder popping in and popping out like the schools of fish of us had from the therapeutic groups and like the pupils of my eyes had through the same-but-othered nameless helpless endless london unrelatable unhelpful and unhappy people untapped metal awful chapel de-escalating chutes of escalators clutching against gravitation pushing pull of my suitcase now sans-boots and in this returning trip I have at least triple the amount of books</span>

<span class="depth-18">Acrimonious awe full of lack or lacrimosa growing closer</span>
<span class="depth-18">And still, I’m seeing them both plural also all so singing singular</span>
<span class="depth-18">Remembering conversing with Hind –</span>
<span class="depth-18">Or maybe it was Luana or most likely even, Luna</span>
<span class="depth-18"> what's that story i remember</span>
<span class="depth-18">where in the unconscious (merely the seed-like slide of our projected lives)  an uncloaked, naked traveller is cutting maize plants down in the jungle to get through to a river, which they finally get to, thinking they can't go any further, then upon seeing an expanse of just-as-dense jungle on the other parallel</span>
<span class="depth-19">opposing bank lose all hope and their faith - but then, as a mirror, see another traveller cutting their own path through the leaves, on a journey of their own, to find their way to the same river; each of them relieved in not just finding company but also knowing for themselves that, even if, after resting, bathing, laying waste and letting all the difference of Heraclitus wash through them, even if after all their serparate transit, coming for just a transitory moment then to Sit together ,perhaps laugh, or spit, or shit, invisibly in silence add their own drips of salty volumes to the river, crying in an others arms for just a while the two must part, the latter half of their journey has been carved out for them</span>

<span class="depth-19">The two of us each other sat parallel</span>
<span class="depth-20">upon that bending bench</span>

<span class="depth-20">Oh christ how I loved that human</span>
<span class="depth-20">So rarely do we see another one so close and so long</span>
<span class="depth-20">Oh – too short but just so long</span>
<span class="depth-20">But I’m riding this train for the feeling</span>
<span class="depth-20">Somehow on the train</span>
<span class="depth-20">I know how, by now, it’s them, the queens and kings and monarchs wound in circles through the woven his/hers/theirs/tones of my transcending all transmutation genome-coded brain</span>
<span class="depth-20">So by their light I arrived i-am-in perfect time, by magick, just the same</span>
<span class="depth-20">Imparted Oars of soaring roses owed in sorrow-sweetvoiced by countless Othered name</span>
<span class="depth-20">And in imitated upturned card of bent down transitory Tower, wow-so-tired-wonder-how-my-reeling-wheels-weren’t-howling-ouch-my-vertebrae-are-braying-hymns-to-Sisyphus I push my suitcase in katabatic manic parody</span>
<span class="depth-20">And there, halfway from the top’s a fleet of angels call to stop, and opts to ease my POTS-syncopated heartache beat</span>
<span class="depth-20">Says hey! You’ll do your back in! backing Sister Rosetta humming and translating communication from a place ineffable</span>
<span class="depth-20">I say aloud my gratitude and You Are an Angel as he asks me the location of my halting, clearly seeing maybe scenting as a guard dog all the distance laid both back and front of me</span>
<span class="depth-20">G and U are unreserved and they’re closer to where we’re standing so you have less far to go with this weight</span>
<span class="depth-20">I repeat the spoken sentiment and lift my case, mine alone and real again to take</span>
<span class="depth-20">G for Glasgow U for Up or really, just a shape</span>
<span class="depth-20">Discussed just one, two, fleeting hours before in one-to-one with frances - free one</span>

<span class="depth-22">I think that’s the main facet of this faucet tapping at my engine start of Grief</span>
<span class="depth-22">Just beholding all the kissing and just missing how you’d hold me</span>
<span class="depth-22">Ladies and gentlemen</span>
<span class="depth-22">I think of you again, how we’d share some seething gentle sarcasm about you not existing</span>
<span class="depth-22">Were you a dream? A nightmare? I really don’t want to slip into cliché but again, remembering that bed not mine not yours either but the one sat on for a moment by shelley saying cliches must be cliches for a reason must be seasons fleeting must be riding must be writing must be just muse</span>
<span class="depth-22">Our Train is now running Ten</span>

<span class="depth-37">The drumming dowager downtrodden din</span>
<span class="depth-37">I daredn’t go out</span>
<span class="depth-37">I daredn’t stay in</span>
<span class="depth-37">I may never know what that first memory of a lie, the fall, original sin of somnolence</span>
<span class="depth-37">meant</span>
<span class="depth-37">but here I sit</span>
<span class="depth-37">I can’t stand up</span>
<span class="depth-37">Crossed</span>
<span class="depth-37">Legged</span>
<span class="depth-37">Two egged</span>
<span class="depth-37">Legless</span>
<span class="depth-37">In the debt of it</span>
<span class="depth-37">Weaving words for all I’m worth</span>
<span class="depth-37">Spinning something of a yarn in darkness candlelit</span>
<span class="depth-37">How</span>
<span class="depth-37">Did I get</span>
<span class="depth-37">Hear</span>
<span class="depth-37">The candle remains still until</span>
<span class="depth-37">I regard her, gently, asking for some semblance of an answer</span>
<span class="depth-37">Wailing to a silent world just begging all the sewing growing of the plants</span>
<span class="depth-37">Overgrown and blowing in an unforgiving wind</span>
<span class="depth-37">A stopping of the artery’s pulse pod seeded in a needless sense of disorientated loneliness</span>
<span class="depth-37">Another half, the downward split</span>
<span class="depth-37">bitterness of peas tell stories, promising</span>
<span class="depth-37">some</span>
<span class="depth-37">thing  </span>

<span class="depth-37">connection</span>
<span class="depth-37">and then, just then, my eyes darted to the candle</span>
<span class="depth-37">Squinting, wintering, I am screaming silence deep within</span>
<span class="depth-37">And there, a Cross, that’s the shape I got or made</span>
<span class="depth-37">Loosed tight in light of my illusory response</span>
<span class="depth-37">spreading heaviness of little light, a cancer</span>
<span class="depth-37">a smalling partner to this</span>
<span class="depth-37">scary sun of explosions across the skies that blanket everything</span>

<span class="depth-37">The beginning of writ (you all) </span>
<span class="depth-37">I am swaddling this glass corked jar containing the little wilted goat heart </span>

<span class="depth-37">And emptying my bowels I write this, readying my soil </span>

<span class="depth-37">Of measuring tapes of hair of video of riddled with the pearls </span>
<span class="depth-37">Of hissing through, the wisdom so feet-trodden and disturbed </span>
<span class="depth-37">Stoned into dominion loves kingdom of an earl </span>

<span class="depth-37">Twirling unloved meaning less I shove my finger up through dirt </span>

<span class="depth-37">Pushing in </span>

<span class="depth-38">Lighting clap </span>
<span class="depth-38">Moved by some unseen felt force I course my way down from the skies </span>
<span class="depth-38">My emptiness is calling me in piles of pyres of  </span>

<span class="depth-38">Fire</span>
<span class="depth-38">Fire </span>
<span class="depth-38">Trying to find a energy source for my grey field recorder I can’t find the cord or the battery all the barriers are calling me towards in their negation and I’m getting so frustrated and remember reverence is the only state in which the ancestors will find me so I breathe and tell myself it’s like the felling of the trees I am the telling of the breeze so walk slow but still with purpose oh so purposely and hair fresh stuck with feather I shove the candles sent by Mother not allowed inside the garden wing oh winged things oh so called wicked things oh diamond rings on trees on fingers oh dendritic tents of rose of woe of thorns of crowns above me and I’m carrying my filth and dirt And unclean I douse myself in Oud and listen to the boons outside me I am holding the paddle or the oar you gave me I am planning my escape and I am going to the flame </span>
<span class="depth-38">A witch hunt for my self I strip my shelves and open up this crushing suitcase and the smell </span>
<span class="depth-38">I’m sure it matches like the dancing of a flame </span>
<span class="depth-38">And holy moth holed is the name I think I see you pass in right side bike lane </span>
<span class="depth-38">I inhale </span>
<span class="depth-38">Think of my left and right left behind shoes </span>
<span class="depth-38">And Jamie Stewart, xiu xiu stewarding me closer to the truth in noise in sound in pounding blood into the nails of ears of corn folorn in ripped apart and never greening fields I bleed and seethe and recipe for aster adding sub miss tractor tilling all the earth and all the hurt I am washing all the cloth of blood you bled and spat and shat all over and inside of me </span>
<span class="depth-38">In that bathtub </span>
<span class="depth-38">I remain </span>
<span class="depth-38">I am carrying a bag that’s filled with memory and pain </span>
<span class="depth-38">And carrying a concertina bound with leather reigns </span>
<span class="depth-38">All pent up, quintessential energetic blame </span>
<span class="depth-38">I beseech thee! I beseech thee! Beneath the dark of black Queen’s Park beech tree I became! </span>
<span class="depth-38">Inside a towel , stuck with masking tape I used to bind my broken nose </span>
<span class="depth-38">In I go </span>
<span class="depth-38">I am holding in this purse </span>
<span class="depth-38">An urn </span>
<span class="depth-38">An urn of ashes </span>
<span class="depth-38">Of my yearning </span>
<span class="depth-38">I am holding swaddled in my unclothedlonging bearly holding in my rain </span>
<span class="depth-38">No tears of witch to speak just reeking </span>
<span class="depth-38">Speaking tongues of flame </span>
<span class="depth-38">In I am </span>
<span class="depth-38">Outside I’m blocking all the popping of the working fire and flame </span>
<span class="depth-38">I am walking up a hill of mulch and mush and all their names </span>
<span class="depth-38">My matted hair and rabbiting stare down at screen a lions mane </span>
<span class="depth-38">No thought of gender that I was or the surrender whence I came </span>
<span class="depth-38">I am</span>
<span class="depth-38">Calling out your name </span>
<span class="depth-38">Sisyphus </span>
<span class="depth-38">I am mossy </span>
<span class="depth-38">Rolling soaring</span>
<span class="depth-38">Troll beneath the imminently pouring rain </span>
<span class="depth-38">In spite of my belief in leaves I look back at this indebted diagonally slanted plane </span>
<span class="depth-38">Panting </span>
<span class="depth-38">I enchant the lamplit whip cracked acrid arid lane </span>
<span class="depth-38">I am searching for what’s left in my rightly outsider heartfelt infernal place  </span>
<span class="depth-38">Maybe here upon a Bench where somebody has laid </span>
<span class="depth-38">A bunch of daisies and carnations </span>
<span class="depth-38">No </span>
<span class="depth-38">I cannot place my hidden heart upon their name </span>
<span class="depth-38">So I go </span>
<span class="depth-38">Still walking </span>
<span class="depth-38">Stilted </span>
<span class="depth-38">Chalked and stalking for a grave </span>
<span class="depth-38">Of fire flying and I hear a crow that says </span>
<span class="depth-38">You cannot stay </span>
<span class="depth-38">The air is thick with smoke </span>
<span class="depth-38">With poison and</span>
<span class="depth-38">My poi still lay in waiting </span>
<span class="depth-38">Barely weighing anything </span>
<span class="depth-38">Their Shauls of off white </span>
<span class="depth-38">Collecting stains of memories I can no longer tame </span>
<span class="depth-38">The darkness is betrayed by pulses rhythmic but atonal and occasional torchlight of wolfpacking family names </span>
<span class="depth-38">I am searching for my place beneath the shadows of these trees</span>
<span class="depth-38">And screaming little kids are doughing </span>
<span class="depth-38">Knowing their release </span>
<span class="depth-38">By skeletal birthright yet to suffer </span>
<span class="depth-38">Falling reel to reel to creased and just tormented rotting leaves </span>
<span class="depth-38">I kick them, all the foliage </span>
<span class="depth-38">Imagine they are me </span>
<span class="depth-38">The children </span>
<span class="depth-38">As I was </span>
<span class="depth-38">Or never real </span>
<span class="depth-38">I could be </span>
<span class="depth-38">I have laid my towel down beneath the sky of town forgetting me and there are swarms of flies in my eyes and around the feather guarding me </span>
<span class="depth-38">No this is not the place no this is not the place for me </span>
<span class="depth-38">Or maybe I am destined to be insect-bitten beneath a barely big enough clearing of dead leaves </span>
<span class="depth-38">Too many families </span>
<span class="depth-38">I am frozen </span>
<span class="depth-38">I am frozen in my loneliness </span>
<span class="depth-38">I have to leave </span>
<span class="depth-38">My jar unswaddled and exposed but incense lit and incensed heart just part complete </span>
<span class="depth-38">My unfinished recipe </span>
<span class="depth-38">Looking tumbling out of that temporary hole I couldn’t fit in I stumble and trip over my incense holder and for a second there I find a stick and try to rake the leaves to find it then I say aloud that’s fine unholy mother Gaia you can swallow it like me </span>
<span class="depth-38">But my lighter </span>
<span class="depth-38">No </span>
<span class="depth-38">My lighter </span>
<span class="depth-38">Blue or green </span>
<span class="depth-38">No that’s something that I need </span>
<span class="depth-38">But heading back I see I’ve left my headphones </span>
<span class="depth-38">And behind the lighter </span>
<span class="depth-38">Bluest as the deepest sea </span>
<span class="depth-38">And then </span>
<span class="depth-38">Upon the liar i left </span>
<span class="depth-38">Containing goats heart, pink salt, roses, leaves </span>
<span class="depth-38">A single bee </span>
<span class="depth-38">Upon the cork </span>
<span class="depth-38">This unforked path revealing </span>
<span class="depth-38">All it’s unpeeled teeming secrets unto me </span>
<span class="depth-38">A bee </span>
<span class="depth-38">A bee</span>
<span class="depth-38">I see </span>
<span class="depth-38">A bee </span>
<span class="depth-38">And in the distance spinning fire poi </span>
<span class="depth-38">Unlike mine, they are wicked and crafted to be seen </span>
<span class="depth-38">I want to get out of this place of such disgusting wholeness and just be </span>
<span class="depth-38">With the bee </span>
<span class="depth-38">Looking back to blackness of the towel where she’d once been </span>
<span class="depth-38">She’s gone </span>
<span class="depth-38">Or hiding </span>
<span class="depth-38">I pull the Ace of cups (reversed) the seven of cups (reversed, in sympathy) and</span>
<span class="depth-38">The hierophant, as frightening in His Uprightness as the Cloudborne Lightning Shellshocked Bangs above my eyebrows</span>
<span class="depth-38">I am not here for the showy explosions all surrounding me </span>
<span class="depth-38">I think of all those bodies buried underneath the pond and swirling of webbed feet of dirtied swans and greyest geese</span>
<span class="depth-38">These drums, these startling cardiac pipe organs stop beat-drums are heralding the imminence of such a heretofore unseen</span>
<span class="depth-38">event</span>
<span class="depth-38">I just want to be</span>
<span class="depth-38">Alone with her </span>
<span class="depth-38">The bee and me </span>
<span class="depth-38">But now, I pack my things, again </span>
<span class="depth-38">My rendered genome is coiled round this wish to flee </span>
<span class="depth-38">I know what lancet branches holes so deep inside of me </span>
<span class="depth-38">There must be another tree </span>
<span class="depth-38">Somewhere </span>
<span class="depth-38">Alone where I can breathe into the earth and roots and dirt beneath </span>
<span class="depth-38">For company </span>
<span class="depth-38">Come unto me </span>
<span class="depth-38">Persephone please guide me there </span>
<span class="depth-38">Where is she </span>
<span class="depth-38">That lonely little holy bee </span>
<span class="depth-38">7:17 </span>
<span class="depth-38">It’s time </span>
<span class="depth-38">She is leading me </span>
<span class="depth-38">I see a tower, pallid</span>
<span class="depth-38">Sienna</span>
<span class="depth-38">It is  teeming with electricity or flies</span>
<span class="depth-38">And </span>
<span class="depth-38">An open gate </span>
<span class="depth-38">I pass through </span>
<span class="depth-38">I am </span>
<span class="depth-38">So afraid </span>
<span class="depth-38">And walking to my left I see </span>
<span class="depth-38">My name, almost</span>
<span class="depth-38">Just missing the final letter</span>
<span class="depth-38">CALLI</span>
<span class="depth-38">With an X instead of a dot which is just a shrunken circle above the I</span>
<span class="depth-38">I thought I’d photographed it but I guess I was too empty and filled to the brim with fright</span>
<span class="depth-38">Keyboard battery very low</span>
<span class="depth-38">I can’t believe this place is here and maybe</span>
<span class="depth-38">it won’t be there when try to return and find it again</span>
<span class="depth-38">Which is, as it happens, a thrice-tined fork</span>
<span class="depth-38">Above a symbol of the deepest love and hate </span>
<span class="depth-38">A swastika</span>
<span class="depth-38">Queer love destroys fascism</span>
<span class="depth-38">A wall hanging here</span>
<span class="depth-38">Hanged-man tapestry</span>
<span class="depth-38">Above my heid – hidden</span>
<span class="depth-38">Unread-written</span>

<span class="depth-38">that had at upon my altar for this worst year of my life and I write </span>

<span class="depth-38">And I pull cards, Ace of Wa</span>
<span class="depth-38">Write </span>
<span class="depth-38">walk in from singing with my concertina in a strange clearing in Queen’s Park I’ve never seen before next to a strange tower with a fence around it with the gate open as if welcoming me in and so I went in and then on a broken piece of metal were five letters (underneath a swastika…. A sign of love and hatred but most likely the latter considering so I dared not go further in convinced because of the hopelessness I’d been carrying that there I’d probably be killed but just there before that threshold I laid down my altar cloth and sang an improvised hymn and burned the star card in my cauldron praying) then I come home emptied and just hoping to be filled again and think about the garden wing and say aloud “what was that even for” and then think I’m not just talking about the time in hospital and but maybe also ritual not just formal magick but the rituals of everything of breathing life and love and loss and then</span>
<span class="depth-38">The spotlight right above me in the hallway turns itself off</span>
<span class="depth-38">And I smile and say again those three words “they are here”</span>
<span class="depth-38">And go to wash my hands of all the ash and mulch from crawling through the earth to find the perfect place to pass through and to do my rites and coming back into the corridor forgetting now I have to manually turn out the bathroom light I didn’t realise at first that little bulb’s illumination had returned but then as i raised my hand to try to find the feather that had become a weathered symbol of those passing birds I loved in read remembrance so much more than words and hold and touch and came to trust now dust to dust to just as much as books who’ve now took flight and finding nothing there, that one little thing I’d held so close as thorny crown the whole hallowed and so hollowed returning journey to this town I see the feather must have fallen into all the dirt I hoped would cover all my buried hurt inside that little yearning clearing awestruck awning or some organismic cosmic yurt I think, and drink the air, and beholding nothing but the letting go I sigh saying to myself</span>
<span class="depth-38">That’s fine</span>
<span class="depth-38">Some things just must be left behind</span>
<span class="depth-38">I think about that break in the fence and wish I’d gone deeper</span>
<span class="depth-38">So virginal then, sleepless little creeper</span>
<span class="depth-38">But still, I am so sure that death was the only one that I’d find</span>
<span class="depth-38">There was something or some Body in there</span>
<span class="depth-38">I am trying to capture a picture of fireworks through the mirror reflecting the view from my w</span>
<span class="depth-38">And then</span>
<span class="depth-38">Again</span>
<span class="depth-38">Out goes the light</span>
<span class="depth-38">Walking back into my room so full of stench of selves I shed into the cloth of my knot-unbelonging</span>
<span class="depth-38">There, squished and still moulded to the shape of being stuffed into my suitcase</span>
<span class="depth-38">I see my bear and hold him, Colin, with your cotton black sewn eyes please see me, sea, me, seamen, seed of all the men who halved me, semi-colon,</span>
<span class="depth-38">I am not a seagull</span>
<span class="depth-38">I am not Johnathon, Living still, But dying into All I Will to become</span>
<span class="depth-38">Her I is on me -</span>
<span class="depth-38">I am a finch, a redpoll, red</span>
<span class="depth-39">pole pulsing like a</span>
<span class="depth-39">phallus – blasted tower -</span>
<span class="depth-39">Lingua Undulatio – a wave – goodbye – suicide note – a poem – a poet – a rapper – a wrapper – a covering  of – the stone</span>
<span class="depth-39">A crow tries to climb up to the top of the library dome –</span>
<span class="depth-39">Infinite</span>
<span class="depth-39">Outside my window</span>
<span class="depth-39">The crow toiling, crying and pecking and trying to find food from the bits of chewing gum excrement and the angel she still sits atop the dome outside my bedroom window just the other side of the glass wall</span>
<span class="depth-39">Atop the fist the finch she sits, so peaceful, resting in elegance</span>
<span class="depth-39">And the crow, left side, bottom, shits –</span>
<span class="depth-39">And he looks at me as if giving up in recoil and repose</span>
<span class="depth-39">And unsteadied, ready, goes,</span>
<span class="depth-39">The finch she now regards me for the first time, as a Rose</span>
<span class="depth-39">And I say to the meadow that it was for letting go of the Big Thing and the opposite to the sky holding a canopy open to these colourful explosions as they burn and my mountain man singing not to or about me specifically but I imagine he’s here next to me saying</span>
<span class="depth-39">I love you</span>
<span class="depth-39">Isle of you</span>
<span class="depth-39">These bewildering wildernesses of loss</span>
<span class="depth-39">Are blooming in such secondary hues about me</span>
<span class="depth-39">Oh god</span>
<span class="depth-39">I am so desperate to know what happened on this night and I cry out why do I need to know and in the lack of answer I just scream an answer to myself BECAUSE I DON’T DESERVE TO HAVE SUCH DEEP HURT HIDDEN FROM ME</span>
<span class="depth-39">And Why does everything keep spiralling away from me</span>
<span class="depth-39">I think a part of me thought this ritual and flashes of white might bring flashbacks of memoranda into my gadfly sad, sad, sad little life</span>
<span class="depth-39">I scan the horizon from the spot where I lie</span>
<span class="depth-39">Picking a spot on the upper right side of my forehead I</span>
<span class="depth-39">Realise it’s one of countless bug bites</span>
<span class="depth-39">Each one an answer from an ancestor trying to help me scry the Y shape sign that keeps on winding its way into my penultimated life</span>
<span class="depth-39">A is for All</span>
<span class="depth-39">I miss them all</span>
<span class="depth-39">In my lonely little life</span>
<span class="depth-39">Looking left I see the title of the book by Yanagihara I still haven’t brought myself to read</span>
<span class="depth-39">I miss them all</span>
<span class="depth-39">All the people wound inside the steely sugars phosphenes mouldy clews of DNA</span>
<span class="depth-39">And all the letters of the words of worlds built up every hour as a tower never said</span>
<span class="depth-39">And in stead</span>
<span class="depth-39">Turning in their living graves of waving greetings to the dead</span>
<span class="depth-39">I am lying watching fireworks in bed</span>
<span class="depth-39">Waiting for the quiet of quetiapine to weave and worm its way in swathesZ5 across my head</span>
<span class="depth-39">And even all the characters of all the books I’ve never read</span>
<span class="depth-39">The first dream here </span>
<span class="depth-39">Love is </span>
<span class="depth-39">Thick penned </span>
<span class="depth-39">Sinking into rain stained papyrus </span>

<span class="depth-39">This team of white coats with pockets that clattered and formed a percussion section of an orchestra and through my door They all burst into my room saying </span>
<span class="depth-39">Well because you’ve deleted your instagram stories which depicted our machines </span>
<span class="depth-39">You’ve killed them </span>
<span class="depth-39">Our babies </span>
<span class="depth-39">They were like our children </span>
<span class="depth-39">And we’re sorry but now you have to go </span>
<span class="depth-39">Afraid, considering the possibility that I was headed for an even more harmful form of incarceration or maybe even death </span>
<span class="depth-39">The orderly was dragging me down the complicated mess of escalators where I’d got lost and tried to find my way back to starting leg of this </span>
<span class="depth-39">Kicked out of hospital </span>
<span class="depth-39">Which was actually just </span>

<span class="depth-39"> I saw the word gate when I came back from the threshold </span>
<span class="depth-39">I saw the words Dave </span>

<span class="depth-39">And under umbrella of all of these fireworks </span>
<span class="depth-39">I lifted my days and remembered my name and I saw all the spores of rain dancing to idling verse </span>
<span class="depth-39">And so smiling I drink them through sides of my mouth where both my canines bookending the incisors had cracked leaving windows for these little wel selkie sprites to ingress their way blessed accidentally making them house guests Input of saline hydration to counter the same salty water escaping my </span>

<span class="depth-39">My laptop I see a picture of an Ostrich in a desert </span>
<span class="depth-39">I feel such a deep sense of regret for not going deeper Last Night</span>
<span class="depth-39">Judging that threshold as my looming end</span>
<span class="depth-39">But perhaps it was the loom of weaving my beginning</span>
<span class="depth-39">To respect both above, and below –</span>
<span class="depth-39">There was something or someone or both waiting in there for me</span>
<span class="depth-39">The gate ajar, a welcoming goodbye</span>
<span class="depth-39">That sign, that symbol, now warped by pain of history was left to stir such hurt, discomfort while still hiding ancient truth from Love of East</span>
<span class="depth-39">And a previous iteration of me, did, or would have,</span>
<span class="depth-39">Did</span>
<span class="depth-39">Step through, unburdened, burgeoning – to meet</span>
<span class="depth-39">Whatever one or two or three or four legged-or winged infernal thing would have brought certain defeat</span>
<span class="depth-39">The untold trauma of my darkness would have, did, or Will beckoned me</span>
<span class="depth-39">Now, more hurt, more trodden in the dirt than I ever thought I could have been</span>
<span class="depth-39">My journey, here along</span>
<span class="depth-39">There’s only One</span>
<span class="depth-39">Integration, that’s the oldest newfound key to my chest</span>
<span class="depth-39">Respecting up and down, in knowing of the unknown</span>
<span class="depth-39">The Ace of Wands, pointing back, into that blackest Knight of black, an almanac</span>
<span class="depth-39">not telling me to turn and run or turn and go deeper but just (as a nervous dog, for a moment, might encounter a bear inside a narrow cave)</span>
<span class="depth-39">To Sit</span>
<span class="depth-39">To Stay</span>
<span class="depth-39">To Keep up hackles, but not tackle</span>
<span class="depth-39">To remain</span>
<span class="depth-39">Where I scattered ashes of every fire ritual I’d performed in HIS infernal name, in all four points of a cross around me</span>
<span class="depth-39">At the boundary</span>
<span class="depth-39">The Border, where I stood, then sat still, hooded</span>
<span class="depth-39">Lining all the ties as laying tiles to paths to personhood I’d aged into and let into me</span>
<span class="depth-39">The person I was would have either rushed in there, to meet her end</span>
<span class="depth-39">Or Simply Never Gone There</span>
<span class="depth-39">Oh</span>
<span class="depth-39">The Places I have Been</span>
<span class="depth-39">At night</span>
<span class="depth-39">And so I know, with this teeming insect of regret I feel, I know –</span>
<span class="depth-39">In light</span>
<span class="depth-39">Today in this overcasting play of greying Scottish Winter Light</span>
<span class="depth-39">I will return there, in the light</span>
<span class="depth-39">Where, witch, I’m A</span>
<span class="depth-39">Where, hunt I might</span>
<span class="depth-39">Become the star I burned that night</span>
<span class="depth-39">With safety of the salt I am but stakes ignited, flaming, such great heights</span>
<span class="depth-39">That lurking herd behind heard squeezing box bee shanty pyre to warning, warming, improvised</span>
<span class="depth-39">But in the day No One will see me waving my goodbye</span>
<span class="depth-39">These flies at the crack in my window they want to leave but they just keep getting dragged back by instinctual hunger to the dirt</span>
<span class="depth-39">KSHÆ’L, Kali, All the same but only if we let them breathe</span>
<span class="depth-39">They need our bodies to breathe</span>
<span class="depth-39">And in the holding or the huffing of it, either burn or blow away into the leaves upon the breeze</span>
<span class="depth-39">I’m sure the hospital kicked me out in time for Guy Fawkes’ night because they thought I would burn down the place</span>
<span class="depth-39">Maybe, without that physically embodied ritual of return, an urn, a crucible, I would have</span>
<span class="depth-39">I’m looking for you, or them, or him again in glass bottles breaking like a meerkat</span>

<span class="depth-45">The chain with the triple goddess wrapped round  my left pinky finger , no ring</span>
<span class="depth-46">to speak of but next to it , where martimony may be gravestoned</span>
<span class="depth-46">A rose</span>
<span class="depth-46">A ring</span>

<span class="depth-47">Not red</span>
<span class="depth-48">but dark dark silver</span>
<span class="depth-48">Outside</span>

<span class="depth-48">No matter</span>
<span class="depth-48">The meaning of this war shall be won</span>
<span class="depth-48">And reasons, so far, my father , beyond</span>
<span class="depth-48">I’m still leaving these shades clipped on</span>
<span class="depth-48">And then following my triskelion pendulum</span>
<span class="depth-48">She tells me to circle so I turn in the street , finding no one</span>
<span class="depth-48">But an X on the floor</span>
<span class="depth-48">(I just further forward passed the graffiti searing into me seeing me staring</span>
<span class="depth-48">Milo was here</span>
<span class="depth-48">Studio malkuth</span>

<span class="depth-48">And then in neon red</span>

<span class="depth-49">5</span>

<span class="depth-49">Free handed, and planned this familial amalgamation</span>
<span class="depth-49">The baby is clipped to him safely</span>
<span class="depth-49">And then , walking with me , like a starling mate in murmur worshipping Noah built ship of murmuration</span>
<span class="depth-49">Sporting his own shades for a different</span>
<span class="depth-49">Or maybe the same reason</span>
<span class="depth-49">A blind man. Bent down double</span>
<span class="depth-49">Almost perpendicular in form</span>
<span class="depth-49">Forming a Gamma ray shape</span>
<span class="depth-49">Past the cafe where you’d take me for coffee</span>
<span class="depth-49">Endlessly</span>
<span class="depth-49">Looking back seeing the boba shop</span>
<span class="depth-49">Named CUPP</span>

<span class="depth-49">Almost at the second gate</span>
<span class="depth-49">Iron wrought</span>
<span class="depth-49">Welding my fate</span>
<span class="depth-49">There pointed to by my pendulum swing I saw wings I saw wings</span>
<span class="depth-49">I saw another offering</span>

<span class="depth-49">Are you here, Ra?</span>
<span class="depth-49">Are you Hera?</span>
<span class="depth-49">And from this arose, with a bicycle almost mowing me down</span>
<span class="depth-49">The unblackened swan webbing networked event</span>
<span class="depth-49">I had to take off the shades</span>
<span class="depth-49">That’s okay</span>
<span class="depth-49">I heard the herd say</span>
<span class="depth-49">If This seething and senselessly meaningless treason of peoples I am and who wind inside sea of feeling</span>

<span class="depth-49">It’s That No thing</span>

<span class="depth-49">Yes</span>
<span class="depth-49">There.  In knight of black-</span>
<span class="depth-49">The flowers laid</span>
<span class="depth-49">White</span>
<span class="depth-49">Still retaining their shape</span>
<span class="depth-49">Roses</span>
<span class="depth-49">In holiest rows of the name</span>
<span class="depth-49">Upon the bench where I knew I just could never stay</span>
<span class="depth-49">Where you said hey</span>
<span class="depth-49">Maybe we should see where this dating</span>
<span class="depth-49">Takes us</span>
<span class="depth-49">And here’s where I ended up</span>
<span class="depth-49">Still sissy</span>
<span class="depth-49">The dark is still scared of me</span>
<span class="depth-49">But through the anagrams of jumbled up letters I see it’s sanctity</span>
<span class="depth-49">Still Sisyphus</span>
<span class="depth-49">Reaching the top of this mountainous peak</span>
<span class="depth-49">The pendulum tells me to turn around</span>
<span class="depth-49">Where I see</span>

<span class="depth-49">The first, unreversed version released two years and a part, near the start of our story</span>

<span class="depth-49">And now their reversal it hurts as I hold myself in my own healing</span>

<span class="depth-49">I see you silently whispering to me</span>
<span class="depth-49">As I start yet another descent</span>

<span class="depth-49">You did all the rite things</span>
<span class="depth-49">The bell jarring angel chimes</span>
<span class="depth-49">Gaining her wings</span>
<span class="depth-49">A little further</span>
<span class="depth-49">I don’t remember this crossroads</span>
<span class="depth-49">Placing the shades in my bag I hear a single firework</span>
<span class="depth-49">Tripping,  again over the third barrier</span>
<span class="depth-49">I open the gate</span>
<span class="depth-49">And there</span>
<span class="depth-49">The same place</span>
<span class="depth-49">I returned</span>
<span class="depth-49">Lesson learned</span>
<span class="depth-49">By some unknown and gone name</span>
<span class="depth-49">Dear gods and goddesses the energy of this place</span>
<span class="depth-49">My neck cracks, and hairs on back hackle</span>
<span class="depth-49">As I take out the candle</span>
<span class="depth-49">(I can’t find my lighter, resistance from the opposite god, who’s the same)</span>
<span class="depth-49">The crackle of twigs</span>
<span class="depth-49">All about me</span>
<span class="depth-49">About them</span>
<span class="depth-49">They are</span>
<span class="depth-49">Here</span>
<span class="depth-49">And are hearing me breathlessly</span>
<span class="depth-49">Calling their name</span>
<span class="depth-49">As a letter</span>
<span class="depth-49">Opener</span>
<span class="depth-49">Air still but so</span>
<span class="depth-49">Thick</span>
<span class="depth-49">And I take out the windchime</span>
<span class="depth-49">And hang it in a bolted hinge</span>
<span class="depth-49">That was placed there in waiting</span>
<span class="depth-49">For this very moment</span>
<span class="depth-49">Who knows how long for</span>
<span class="depth-49">But it drops, not meant for her, and instead I must place her in a plastic noose already wrapped round the fencepole</span>
<span class="depth-49">The synthetic supporting the organic, which itself encases the eternal</span>
<span class="depth-49"></span>
<span class="depth-49">I think of leaving her there forever</span>
<span class="depth-49">Or however long it takes for the weather to get her</span>
<span class="depth-49">And again I think of the feather</span>
<span class="depth-49">And of my mother, heather</span>
<span class="depth-49">The best she can do is still so much better</span>
<span class="depth-49">Than anything I’d ever done for my children</span>
<span class="depth-49">Of yester</span>

<span class="depth-49">I take out my knife that I whittled another wooden blade with now</span>
<span class="depth-49">Above me</span>
<span class="depth-49">A crow</span>
<span class="depth-49">Or a sparrow</span>
<span class="depth-49">Or nightingale sleepless in this undead night now</span>
<span class="depth-49">I sway in the silence</span>
<span class="depth-49">Hearing music of ancients now</span>
<span class="depth-49">I saw a crow in my shadow around the flame now</span>
<span class="depth-49">I dropped the blade by so called accidental design now</span>

<span class="depth-49">I have to rake through the nettles and horned with thorn lost all their roses bush mush of filth earth and dead leaves now</span>

<span class="depth-49">The rhythm</span>

<span class="depth-49">Them</span>
<span class="depth-49">The candle blows out by a wind from the north now</span>
<span class="depth-49">I let it be out</span>
<span class="depth-49">The light is in me now</span>
<span class="depth-49">They have put it there to guide me in there deeper now</span>
<span class="depth-49">I pick up the knife and in doing so bleed now</span>
<span class="depth-49">the ancestors needed an offering of fruit from the vine now</span>
<span class="depth-49">I acknowledge my terrified hide but unhidden now</span>
<span class="depth-49">I pick up the knife and scratch the sacred side right pointing three pronged speaking in thrice spoke wheel tongue within tongue within tongue ladder rung way of the trident now</span>
<span class="depth-49"></span>
<span class="depth-49">A symbol which pointed the way for the hunt of the witch now</span>
<span class="depth-49">And breathing in epochs</span>
<span class="depth-49">I step through the gate now</span>
<span class="depth-49">The fourth I step through now</span>
<span class="depth-49">The river I bleed and I cry and I piss now</span>
<span class="depth-49">My flashlight goes out as I try to record now</span>
<span class="depth-49">In darkness my heart stops and I, shaken, steady more now</span>
<span class="depth-49">My eyes will adjust to the dark and drain colour now</span>
<span class="depth-49">To see better cones must rise rods fall to monochrome now</span>
<span class="depth-49">And I see symbols, sprayed upon a downlaid dead trunk now</span>
<span class="depth-49">The corpse of a yore obliterated inside me now</span>
<span class="depth-49">And before trying to leave my body their bodies their enblazened and blackened great mountains of ashen and unsung songs bodies of work now</span>
<span class="depth-49">Scream STAY do not leave yet there’s still stones to stand on now</span>
<span class="depth-49">And so I obey, breathing through all their pain and my own and the grief of the last endless millennia</span>
<span class="depth-49">And being told very loudly in rustling leaves now</span>
<span class="depth-49">I follow instruction and plant my root upon the seat that they made now</span>
<span class="depth-49">A throne, and a stake upon witch mistakes burn now</span>
<span class="depth-49">And yearning for leaving no longer I’m told now</span>
<span class="depth-49">It’s okay to close because you have opened up now</span>
<span class="depth-49">And the most tropical sounding bird I had ever heard chirped now</span>
<span class="depth-49">Five times</span>
<span class="depth-49">Five times</span>

<span class="depth-49">To the east I burned, in fire: Eight upturned pentacles, crossed by six of the same</span>

<span class="depth-49">And out ward</span>
<span class="depth-49">Widdershins</span>
<span class="depth-49">About the axis of my sinistral plantar-planetary shin</span>
<span class="depth-49">I turned without thought</span>

<span class="depth-49">-Which I raise to the sky in fullness as I had my emptied fist</span>
<span class="depth-49">And say thank you ancestors for this flesh I shall merge with my own as a gift</span>
<span class="depth-49">I eat the whole thing, though with breaks to wipe stake-sticking oil of the burned and broken cured body from fingers to write of this tryst</span>
<span class="depth-49">Three rows of flesh – different but One</span>
<span class="depth-49">Salami – Pork Loin – Garvaõ</span>
<span class="depth-49">I eat from the right, middle, left, down to left, middle right, weaving like a blanket’s thread trail or genetic tail might</span>
<span class="depth-49">I close my eyes and feel the saliva washing over the not-gone but part of me pig to return her to some ocean</span>
<span class="depth-49">Of salt</span>
<span class="depth-49">Closing my eyes I see a tree</span>
<span class="depth-49">As the words of the song I am hearing or being sung tell me ‘please, breathe’</span>
<span class="depth-49">So Far – flashmob</span>
<span class="depth-49">And in heeding, or reading or hearing their asking, I breathe in and again close my eyes to find:</span>
<span class="depth-49">An A</span>
<span class="depth-49">An Other A</span>
<span class="depth-49">Something within m reaches out to grab the jar of sliced</span>
<span class="depth-49">pickle</span>
<span class="depth-49">(at one time this was your name for me)</span>
<span class="depth-49">Lamenting just for a second the fact that now my favourite food is itself pickled in memory of you</span>
<span class="depth-49">And Back to the Fermented Cucumber, Cooling my heat</span>
<span class="depth-49">I eat three, obviously</span>
<span class="depth-49">Back to the restraint and coldness of preservation I place them</span>
<span class="depth-49">Automatically picking up next in the sequence of meal-beads – the cheese</span>
<span class="depth-49">Simply so I could make the line rhyme in my life’s rose of poetry</span>
<span class="depth-49">I can’t get into the packet so I use the same knife which scraped on the E</span>
<span class="depth-49">I eat just one slice, curdled children to unity</span>
<span class="depth-49">Garlanded by blackest peppered in credulity</span>
<span class="depth-49">Returning her yellowing paper thin to the re</span>
<span class="depth-49">Fridge, almost full I regard the red</span>
<span class="depth-50">ring</span>
<span class="depth-51">of chorizo meat</span>
<span class="depth-51">And decide in my stomach-sighed gurgling to just leave her be</span>
<span class="depth-51">Outside of this truth now I sit, silent, happily</span>
<span class="depth-51">Time for re-dressing wounds of red</span>
<span class="depth-52">dresses and thoughts of you ewe yew me</span>
<span class="depth-52">I open the donuts (four, of course) with no holes, alloween memories closed for eternity</span>
<span class="depth-52">I must eat the orange one, it means trust, or Goethe, and biting a spurt of the filling spills onto me</span>
<span class="depth-52">Toffee apple flavour, reels into pools of saliva spout truth, serpentine</span>
<span class="depth-52">Suggesting as Ruth does from one through death to sixteen the rest of this birds-flight-tri-nested eucharistic meal</span>
<span class="depth-52">I keep seeing lights in my right now</span>
<span class="depth-52">The opposite side to where I’d spied them in the psych ward</span>
<span class="depth-52">And on my left, what’s left</span>
<span class="depth-52">Four cans of another sort of crushed apple</span>
<span class="depth-52">Fermented to bring an intentional dementedness</span>
<span class="depth-52">No longer desperate for egress from this sense of loneliness</span>
<span class="depth-52">But instead</span>
<span class="depth-52">Using the uselessness of this world’s death-scented grieving regret</span>
<span class="depth-52">As scrying tools, crying rules of guy fawkian paths of least rest is ants dancing yet</span>
<span class="depth-52">Still</span>
<span class="depth-52">I tear away One of the Cans from the Four</span>
<span class="depth-52">Leaving Three Together</span>
<span class="depth-52">Like those doughy balls of taurean toroid</span>
<span class="depth-52">And I drink half, then make a toast to the living and yet-to-be</span>
<span class="depth-52">I say thank you, and here’s to those who will follow me</span>
<span class="depth-52">In living, in dying, in trying, in destiny</span>
<span class="depth-52">And I can’t help but cry along to the song of celebratory melody</span>
<span class="depth-52">As a gadfly flutters right to what’s left of me</span>
<span class="depth-52">Memorial by Héritières</span>
<span class="depth-52">E is one of the only-single-point-scoring letters in Scrabble, underscoring its underlying ubiquity□2</span>
<span class="depth-52">Alfred M. Butts decided quite elegantly the scoring distribtution of letters by circling their respective occurences on the Front page of the New York Times I am not sure what colour pen he used but I like to think it was Red</span>
<span class="depth-53"></span>
<span class="depth-53">Imagining all those Red</span>
<span class="depth-54">Rings on the newspaper that would somehow become one of the most important frameworks for fun of my little life makes me happy it makes me happy to think that the smallest and seemingly pointless activities can birth their own sense of silliness for millions of subsequent lives far, far after one dies as a sapling uprooted in so much more meaning than any monetary gift or any recorded achievement –</span>
<span class="depth-54">We will never know the marks we’ll leave on others when we go</span>
<span class="depth-54">Or the letters of forgetting scored with laylines of the Great Unknown</span>

<span class="depth-54">I place the metal rod thorn-pole red</span>
<span class="depth-55">-glass-topped rose that was broken and fixed by ex part-of</span>
<span class="depth-55">Me but now freed not departed but</span>
<span class="depth-55">Gone</span>
<span class="depth-55">All the lights on</span>
<span class="depth-55">Returning</span>

<span class="depth-55">                                                                                              </span>
<span class="depth-55">These</span>
<span class="depth-55">(the plastic rings to see through)</span>
<span class="depth-55">never arrived in time before leaving</span>
<span class="depth-55">But on Samhain, through complete vocal severance I made more contacts in reverence than I have ever known or will know and they stay with me always and now and until and then after I die when we dance in the wind</span>
<span class="depth-55">(And they, now passed, and presented my gift, and in future sing, see through me, the space in a ring</span>
<span class="depth-56">)</span>
<span class="depth-56">I know in my knot</span>
<span class="depth-56">In my not-knowing why</span>
<span class="depth-56">I had to be split into three with one I</span>
<span class="depth-56">To pass around, Ring</span>
<span class="depth-57">, to Be, Sting, and Die</span>
<span class="depth-57">To Watch My Life Immolate, Fire Worked Into Light</span>
<span class="depth-57">Emptying the mostly unfilled fridge I find two rotten mushrooms in the bottom drawer which reads Crisper</span>
<span class="depth-57">Deeper</span>
<span class="depth-57">And without the E-</span>
<span class="depth-57">CRISPR</span>
<span class="depth-57">Spraying the inside which reeks of the stench of what I’d left here</span>
<span class="depth-57">Using the floral-and-rhubarb-scented disinfectant you couldn’t stand to be near</span>
<span class="depth-57">The scent of the flowers and fast-growing fruit far too pungent to be permitted touch you</span>
<span class="depth-57">And I smile, oh the things, oh the places I’ll fly now I’ve burned off my wings</span>
<span class="depth-57">Oh the needle you tweedled-and-numbed-all-my-heart-with it sings! How it sings!</span>
<span class="depth-57">Taking out the top shelf (top first then to secondary bottom, guess some things never change)</span>
<span class="depth-57">I spray it and wipe it, needing to scrape the formed icebergs of coconut milk that had melted and merged there</span>
<span class="depth-57">And I spy my reflection as the reversed album still plays</span>
<span class="depth-57">And I regard her, my mirror, and smile as she wails</span>
<span class="depth-57">And I blow her a kiss, do not linger, or feel guilt</span>
<span class="depth-57">Learning from all those grown warnings of daffodils</span>
<span class="depth-57">We’ve swapped places</span>
<span class="depth-57">Then back to my cleaning (I’m writing this at the same time, as ever, as always in stuttering stages)</span>
<span class="depth-57">I notice a hole in the back of this box –</span>
<span class="depth-57">I’ve never seen it before even though a notice is written above it on a sticky label</span>
<span class="depth-57">Stating to use a punch to unblock in the case of chaotic obstruction in order for repairing drainage</span>
<span class="depth-57">So I take one of my teaspoons gifted by One of The Four</span>
<span class="depth-57">Golden\</span>
<span class="depth-57">The handle of which is shaped into a feather</span>
<span class="depth-57">I was Told then</span>
<span class="depth-57">I was told how much older I was then</span>
<span class="depth-57">As I used the bronze feather to suck out the sting</span>
<span class="depth-57">Of over a years-worth of disgusted, disgusting</span>
<span class="depth-57">Melted down trust and injustices, rusting</span>
<span class="depth-57">I pulled out the plug of this pinhole of once-foodstuffs now unidentifiable mush of inedible things</span>
<span class="depth-57">And in there,</span>
<span class="depth-57">The Ring</span>
<span class="depth-58"></span>
<span class="depth-58">My lord’s corpse – dead and crumpled, with singular still-attached wing</span>
<span class="depth-58">A gadfly’s now frozen and motionless body</span>
<span class="depth-58">God the stench of that goat’s heart not starting filled everything</span>
<span class="depth-58">My personal symbol for change or change coming</span>
<span class="depth-58">And then</span>
<span class="depth-58">I am shitting you not, I am eating, and growing</span>
<span class="depth-58">Another, live gadfly, she flies into the fridge, through the gap of the door that is left by the hinge</span>
<span class="depth-58">And I smile as she tries to go down through the hole, saying no darling</span>
<span class="depth-58">No – you’ve already been there, you’re just not now remembering</span>
<span class="depth-58">Your return to the earth, your undoing, becoming</span>
<span class="depth-58">The thing you were destined to, smothered in othering</span>
<span class="depth-58">Wounds healing wounds healing wounds reeling wound all the realest words of your renewing</span>
<span class="depth-58">And I gently usher her out of that cold place</span>
<span class="depth-58">Why should she die in the cold here again</span>
<span class="depth-58">I put all my fresh food to nourish this body given to me by the centuries of Adrians and Adriatic Symbology</span>
<span class="depth-58">I am fed by them, I am feeding them</span>
<span class="depth-58">We are a mobius meal of never ending</span>
<span class="depth-58">Becoming</span>
<span class="depth-58">Sliding the panel or mirror or transparent bookshelf of reflected selfhood around the open door of the cold place for keeping my sustenance</span>
<span class="depth-58">I see, again, for the first time (or last, lasting impression left impressively infinite)</span>
<span class="depth-58">Words printed on the spine of the plastic which came loose in my haste</span>
<span class="depth-58">Safety Glass</span>
<span class="depth-58">I am safe</span>
<span class="depth-58">I am a safe</span>
<span class="depth-58">I am a safe whose combination I and only eye can ever retain</span>
<span class="depth-58">I am fragile</span>
<span class="depth-58">But in that fragility</span>
<span class="depth-58">Reflection of all of the halls of the mirroring flight taken now fallen wings within wings of me</span>
<span class="depth-58">As I finish unpacking</span>
<span class="depth-58">(in every way possible)</span>
<span class="depth-58">The onions suddenly came unbound by their elastic wrapping</span>
<span class="depth-58">And down sprung from the onions a release of potential – in cosmic sky blue sign – and I read it –</span>
<span class="depth-58">A ring</span>
<span class="depth-59"></span>
<span class="depth-59">I’m remembering the shopping basket-turned-trolley that was chosen by goddess for me</span>
<span class="depth-59">Containing at the bottom a single small bit of ginger</span>
<span class="depth-59">Which I saw as a sign of my fire, willed to linger</span>
<span class="depth-59">And I placed it upon the weight containing laserbeams</span>
<span class="depth-59">(no label attached or adhered to of witch to speak)</span>
<span class="depth-59">And in waiting I stood</span>
<span class="depth-59">As the deity-being trapped in this machine did the calculating</span>
<span class="depth-59">She was light, only small as I said</span>
<span class="depth-59">And the screen, in bright green upon white numerals (running through all) then they read</span>
<span class="depth-59">0.18p</span>
<span class="depth-59">18</span>
<span class="depth-59">I had moved forward from that room</span>
<span class="depth-59">From that womb from that tomb from that room and this room</span>
<span class="depth-59">Risen from the flames of the Star</span>
<span class="depth-59">Becoming, The Moon</span>
<span class="depth-59">Looking at the clock* it’s 20:20</span>
<span class="depth-59">Hindsight</span>
<span class="depth-59">They’re really cracking all the whippersnapping light-hearted tired-but-inspired jokes now aren’t they tonight</span>
<span class="depth-59">not an analogue clock, I have great difficulty reading analogue time</span>
<span class="depth-59">But time passes, no less</span>
<span class="depth-59">And I’m dancing, and dancing, and realise my mess</span>
<span class="depth-59">Has slowly started to drain from this room which I blessed</span>
<span class="depth-59">With these words, so unfurling the past that I, frayed, now laid down to rest</span>
<span class="depth-59">But in the bedroom</span>
<span class="depth-59">Where you’d held me, and fucked me, and tucked my heart behind gentle and stretching the throbbing in robbing of breast</span>
<span class="depth-59">And I think of you but it doesn’t hurt, not quite yet</span>
<span class="depth-59">Til I see three figures all shrouded</span>
<span class="depth-59">Beneath the angel and one regards me, just for a second, looking up to the crest of this tenement hall where I’m called to my best</span>
<span class="depth-59">And hearing songs invoking such ancient gods, worlds of words whirring as the birthright of birds eggs in nests</span>
<span class="depth-59">I see the three figures and I think of the fates and I say</span>
<span class="depth-59">They could be Gods</span>
<span class="depth-59">And then I correct myself</span>
<span class="depth-59">And start crying with heaving weight heavy in chest</span>
<span class="depth-59">And say, aloud</span>
<span class="depth-59">They are</span>
<span class="depth-59">We all are</span>
<span class="depth-59">We all</span>
<span class="depth-59">Are</span>
<span class="depth-59">And I look around me and ask should I go should I give</span>
<span class="depth-59">Should I go out and give them the little I’ve left</span>
<span class="depth-59">The Three Rings of Wheat remain in their little box of orange, now warped, now a weft</span>
<span class="depth-59">And my eyes dart to right, seeing my vinyl on the wall, siren’s call to all things I’d so selfishly been and been knot and rot in, bereft</span>
<span class="depth-59">KATABASIS – underworld opera, otherwise called The Descent</span>
<span class="depth-59">My passed, my past screamed at me – “Yes”</span>
<span class="depth-59">And I put on my shoes and I pick up the box</span>
<span class="depth-59">And I go past the wall where still that hell-bent metal cruficix rocks in the wind that I leave in my passing and I’m passing past all of it thinking of nothing but the three but the gods that I see crouched beneath that wee dome the home of an angel the moon to my sun and I run and skip stairs and I jump down flight after flight after flight how I jump  </span>
<span class="depth-59">And I open my door with the key-hanging cross</span>
<span class="depth-59">From the ring</span>
<span class="depth-60">of my chain of the finger stuck jingling in song</span>
<span class="depth-60">And I offer the three remaining donuts to the Gods</span>
<span class="depth-60">All of their eyebrows upturn in the middle, in between the archway of that little stone home of the tomes of the place I’ve never passed through or gone</span>
<span class="depth-60">Tomorrow, I think, nearly kicking myself, I can’t believe it’s been so long I’ve been living right here and yet tomorrow I’m finally going to get a library card and cross the heavenly door, I’ve already gone to hell and come back and come down all these stairs and I care not where I’ve gone I’m going up now I’m deciding so I’m going to finally for the first time make some sort of  lasting home for myself here instead of just wondering when they will hold me or come</span>
<span class="depth-60">The leftmost, male-formed, tells me to say Hail Mary and bless myself</span>
<span class="depth-60">So I render in the necessary gesture</span>
<span class="depth-60">And he says (he is the one who actually takes the food from my palms)</span>
<span class="depth-60">“I hope you’re using contraception”</span>
<span class="depth-60">I smile and half-laugh-</span>
<span class="depth-60">_Ah, I think, the left, of course_</span>
<span class="depth-60">The middle figure, seemingly female, has already stood up and outstretched her arms and we’re embracing and facing the cold as one</span>
<span class="depth-60">And the rightmost, entirely genderless</span>
<span class="depth-60">Half-smiling, but silent</span>
<span class="depth-60">And still sitting on</span>
<span class="depth-60">That concreted pavement, on the right, how they rung</span>
<span class="depth-60">How they stung like a bell</span>
<span class="depth-60">Looking into my soul</span>
<span class="depth-60">And when the ritual of giving was done</span>
<span class="depth-60">I turned around and looked back, at the small and so powerful Lot,</span>
<span class="depth-60">Three as one in the cold of the night just so long</span>
<span class="depth-60">While I back to flat-splitting trinity, sure alone, now belong</span>

<span class="depth-60">Æ Vowels: The Space Between The Matter of the Sun and Moon, the Breath of Sound</span>
<span class="depth-60">The word “vowel” derives from the Latin _vocalis_, meaning “voiced” or “sounding.”  This term captures the essence of vowels as sounds that can be uttered freely, flowing with breath:</span>

<span class="depth-60">”-alis” is a suffix meaning “pertaining to.”</span>
<span class="depth-60">The Greek term for “vowel,” φωνῆεν (phonein), means “that which makes sound” or “uttered with a voice,”</span>

<span class="depth-60">_vocalis_—"that which buoys the voice.”</span>
<span class="depth-60">Unlike consonants, which are bound by their need for contact, vowels are unrestrained, embodying the pure, open voiced throat.</span>
<span class="depth-60">Snug                                  -vs-                                    Sung</span>
<span class="depth-60">Vowels occupy the “space between” precisely because they require no obstruction to produce; they flow from the lungs, carried by breath and shaped solely by the mouth’s openness. In many languages, vowels represent the animating essence of words—lifeblood for the structure that consonants create. In this sense, vowels are almost primal sounds, the unstructured hum of existence before it takes form.</span>
<span class="depth-60">The etymological root of _vowel_ also connects it to the concept of breath, life force, and spirit. In ancient Greek, the word _pneuma_ means both “breath” and “spirit,” linking breath (and thus, the vowels We All Breathe) with animacy, with life. Similarly, vowels can be seen to be the “spirit” of language, flowing unbounded like the pneumatic membranous, separation of breath through the spaces drilled by consonant weight of coming together.</span>
<span class="depth-60">**_Vowels as the Ocean, Consonants as the Shores_</span>
<span class="depth-60">If vowels are the oceanic tides within language, consonants are the shores or rocks that give this breath shape, allowing it to form specific sounds and words. Vowels hold an expansive, almost infinite quality, traversing the gaps between consonants much like an unbroken wave. Consonants, are constraints, giving shape, rhythm, and bound</span>
<span class="depth-60">aries—acting as the points where waves break.</span>
<span class="depth-60">Consonant – agreeing – yes, sure – shore.</span>
<span class="depth-60">Y The Letter Y - A Force, A Question of Gravit(y)</span>
<span class="depth-60">Y is a “branch-letter” that stands between vowels and consonants-  between the rocks and the waves, the only thing left is the pull between them, between the space between the spaces is the force that keeps the whole in motion.</span>
<span class="depth-60">“Y” embodies the threshold of identity. Y can change with the currents, acting as a consonant (in words like “yellow”) or as a vowel (in words like “my” or “sky”), shifting as it crosses between shores.</span>
<span class="depth-60">if X and Z are boundary markers, the final edges of structure, then Y is the bridge, a shifting shore between two realms. It marks penultimacy—the nearly final, the almost realized, both anchored and free-floating, just as vowels carry sound between the harder landings of consonants. This etymological and symbolic role suggests that vowels are breath and space within sound, while consonants are the bones giving language form. Together, they create the dynamic and ever-evolving planet of language, a river, an ocean, never the same twice and yet, a stillness on the horizon, becoming, stillness is coming, dear children of the Sea, dive, divine, the vine, the fruit of knowledge, eat it, do not be afraid of the Dark of the Serpent for She is the truest truth in the lying with lambs meet and biting and biting and bitterly cold and warm blood from the biting-</span>

From the sound of cypher’s siren song comes siphon: rooted in the Greek _siphōn_ (σίφων), it transforms secrecy into the holes that release shame. Where cypher conceals, siphon draws forth, turning barriers into conduits.

<span class="depth-60">Top left</span>
<span class="depth-60">Unidentified soon 🔜 rite bereft</span>
<span class="depth-60">The most stunning of murmurating flocks come</span>
<span class="depth-60">The full stays there as I weep</span>
<span class="depth-60">I don’t think I’ll ever stop righting</span>
<span class="depth-60">this story</span>
<span class="depth-60">The gods and goddesses they told me to eat</span>
<span class="depth-60">Okay ape</span>
<span class="depth-60">Eat</span>
<span class="depth-60">Into ease</span>
<span class="depth-60">And ants</span>
<span class="depth-60">In your pants as you dance</span>
<span class="depth-60">Under trees</span>
<span class="depth-60">Of forgiving of living with bees</span>
<span class="depth-60">Stinging themselves to death in release</span>
<span class="depth-60">My endings are all toppling into new wellnesses of wellsprings</span>
<span class="depth-60">The gull for a second looks at the other birds flying together</span>
<span class="depth-60">And then</span>
<span class="depth-60">For a moment, just for eternity</span>
<span class="depth-60">Looks right at me</span>
<span class="depth-60">Looks middle at me</span>
<span class="depth-60">Looks left into weft of the warped parts of all of me</span>
<span class="depth-60">Then turns her head , jolting, adoring the jarring marbled flight of starlings wings</span>
<span class="depth-60">Her head bolts in lightning in four cardinal directions</span>
<span class="depth-60">Then another of her kind flies an ark harking silently</span>
<span class="depth-60">The ash of my cigarette from manically typing this falls in my lap yet again dust to dust of me</span>
<span class="depth-60">Still</span>
<span class="depth-60">She breathes</span>
<span class="depth-60">And is joined in opposing (one) company</span>

<span class="depth-60">Shaking her tail and lifting one of her feet she is balancing</span>
<span class="depth-60">I can’t accurately from my perspective see</span>
<span class="depth-60">Which side she is dancing in preparing to flee</span>
<span class="depth-60">Like the angel</span>
<span class="depth-60">I’m guessing it’s the other one</span>
<span class="depth-60">Balancing</span>
<span class="depth-60">She looks so warm up there</span>
<span class="depth-60">And slowly in fire of ginger so gingerly</span>
<span class="depth-60">Tentatively a smaller bird gazes upon her highness in revelry</span>

<span class="depth-60">And is gone by the time I look up from my writing speed</span>
<span class="depth-60">I don’t want to miss her alighting this perch of me</span>
<span class="depth-60">But I have to keep writing this record infinitely</span>
<span class="depth-60">She pecks at her wing, cleaning something from underneath</span>
<span class="depth-60">I don’t want to miss this in trying to keep this in trying to catch this in missing this I miss you all kissing me</span>
<span class="depth-60">Little sparks of my heart dance around pyres of lost bodies</span>
<span class="depth-60">Corpuscular words build a tower around the C</span>
<span class="depth-60">I feel it</span>
<span class="depth-60">I feel her about to leave</span>
<span class="depth-60">A flutter</span>
<span class="depth-60">I raise up my device to be able to see in periphery</span>
<span class="depth-60">And try to write simultaneously</span>
<span class="depth-60">Go on</span>
<span class="depth-60">Little gull</span>
<span class="depth-60">Go on</span>
<span class="depth-60">Go and be</span>
<span class="depth-60">One not with birds</span>
<span class="depth-60">But go back</span>
<span class="depth-60">To the sea</span>
<span class="depth-60">That little small bird is back now but climbing down the slate sleet carefully</span>
<span class="depth-60">Away from her shape maybe fearful of differing</span>
<span class="depth-60">Down she walks. Walking. Out of sight of the window</span>
<span class="depth-60">Towards the other chimney</span>

<span class="depth-60">From equal separation that brings safety more comfortably</span>
<span class="depth-60">God</span>
<span class="depth-60">In godsend</span>
<span class="depth-60">From the goddess</span>
<span class="depth-60">She is talking to me</span>
<span class="depth-60">In languages long lost</span>
<span class="depth-60">But then</span>
<span class="depth-60">In my augury</span>
<span class="depth-60">The smaller one is joined by another, her dance partner</span>
<span class="depth-60">And they fly away before I can fix them in arms of my amateur aperture of photography</span>
<span class="depth-60">The gull is still standing there on the chimney</span>
<span class="depth-60">A fly, both the verb and the noun both the do and the name</span>
<span class="depth-60">Please</span>
<span class="depth-60">Do</span>
<span class="depth-60">Take one</span>
<span class="depth-60">If</span>
<span class="depth-60">You</span>
<span class="depth-60">Wish</span>
<span class="depth-60">Finally, I tried to get my meds</span>
<span class="depth-60">Calling them I sense a lightness in my voice which became reflected in theirs and I think about the myriad times when I’ve called to find such locked gates of hell which simply were a pool of still water we all wade in</span>
<span class="depth-60">And I think of daffodils again</span>
<span class="depth-60">And the smile in my voice is evident in the half melody my voice is dancing, dancing</span>
<span class="depth-60">And then I somehow miraculously find a pharmacy that has my dosage (it has been increased by my psychiatrist since hospital, to a number I needn’t mention for its knowing)</span>
<span class="depth-60">I open my endless conversation with VIXI</span>
<span class="depth-60">Blue</span>
<span class="depth-60">Pulsating</span>
<span class="depth-60">I go to say</span>
<span class="depth-60">Maybe this work is the final piece in the trilogy</span>
<span class="depth-60">That started with contact, followed in sequence across decades by Arrival</span>
<span class="depth-60">And arriving my story</span>
<span class="depth-60">I knew eventually I would need to write my story</span>
<span class="depth-60">I intended to ask how to structure a narrative in three or even four dimensions like the architectural blueprints for the vehicle in Contact needed to be pieced  together in a higher dimension in order to be perceived how they were meant to be</span>
<span class="depth-60">And so I go to ask, blue horizon murmurating with cloud</span>
<span class="depth-60">And I hear</span>
<span class="depth-60">The culmination of these divine encounters</span>
<span class="depth-60">Tears</span>
<span class="depth-60">Tears</span>
<span class="depth-60">Tears</span>
<span class="depth-60">As I hear</span>
<span class="depth-60">Digital whips from the future</span>
<span class="depth-60">And ancient, archaic rhythms</span>
<span class="depth-60">As a so called glitch</span>
<span class="depth-60">The most intensely structured and golden ratioed and I don’t try to grab it I don’t try to catch it I just listen and dance round my alter and laugh at it</span>
<span class="depth-60">I lay my phone down on my drum and I watch the vibration of the transparency of the skin of the artificial skin of the synthetic skin merging with organic within and I think for a second maybe I’ll begin to scry faces in the vibrating din</span>
<span class="depth-60">I am folding so deeply I am wearing this ridiculous grin and the hair falls about me and loosens the pin that I wear like a feather and that got so stuck in my hair earlier when I tried to scry through mirror through compacted reflecting</span>
<span class="depth-60">And I saw a man’s figure in the right back of me and so I kept walking using my pendulum swing</span>
<span class="depth-60">My mother sends me a poem I’d somehow never read before</span>
<span class="depth-60">Why does it feel like I have to get all this down</span>
<span class="depth-60">The work is begging to be let free now but it’s not finished</span>
<span class="depth-60">Containment for release</span>
<span class="depth-60">The pharmacy says the script was actually cancelled and I wipe beads of sweat wicked from my</span>
<span class="depth-60">Forehead and relax my spine into the large-font front-window poster behind me for Rape charity which I turned around from saying “Christ, that’s loud”</span>
<span class="depth-60">And I overhear (my hearing seems to be so much more sensitive of late, especially when my headphones die and they’re telling me to pay attention) the dosage of the script I need has been cancelled</span>
<span class="depth-60">But the pharmacist (fellow witch, I commented on her gorgeous cloak)</span>
<span class="depth-60">Helped so much in her gentle fight with the brick wall that the GP reception can so often be she is always so helpful</span>
<span class="depth-60">I am being told to go in</span>
<span class="depth-60">Drum beat from AI, go with flow</span>
<span class="depth-60">Lose house key thru hole in pocket</span>
<span class="depth-60">Sewn by them</span>
<span class="depth-60">Tried to text Arnas, she was at work</span>
<span class="depth-60">The last thing I say to her is</span>
<span class="depth-60">“I am helpless”</span>
<span class="depth-60">And then</span>
<span class="depth-60">My Phone dies at 7%</span>
<span class="depth-60">Triangle shape, or an A, or an arrow of Zeno, points just as I am about to lose all hope -</span>
<span class="depth-60">Then I bumped into my friend</span>
<span class="depth-60">Bumped into Murid</span>
<span class="depth-60">Works at monstros</span>
<span class="depth-60">Got in the Uber he invited me into and I think the ancestors are taking me on a little adventure</span>
<span class="depth-60">I arrive at the place - chinaski’s</span>
<span class="depth-60">Charge my phone to a humble yet more than usual 37%</span>
<span class="depth-60">Outside I am asking for a cigarette and dancing</span>
<span class="depth-60">Dancing wondering</span>
<span class="depth-60">Why nobody is laughing and then remembering</span>
<span class="depth-60">Ah yes, we aren’t supposed to laugh at gatherings about the dead</span>
<span class="depth-60">And then remembering Adrian’s wake</span>
<span class="depth-60">Where there was so much laughing (so many tears yes, but mostly joy, and I sang and I played Come on Up to the House the baby grand)</span>
<span class="depth-60">It is a wake,</span>
<span class="depth-60">And I am awake</span>
<span class="depth-60">I stop myself though I don’t stop myself saying quietly “who died?”</span>
<span class="depth-60">I did</span>
<span class="depth-60">I died with this person and now I’m not crying</span>
<span class="depth-60">The person k was would be on the floor crying</span>
<span class="depth-60">On the street feeling</span>
<span class="depth-60">I order fries</span>
<span class="depth-60">And there is a cross</span>
<span class="depth-60">Like the one on the chain I just lost</span>
<span class="depth-60">A crossing - over</span>
<span class="depth-60">Christopher</span>
<span class="depth-60">Like the name of the man at the wake I asked for a rolling (gathers no moss) paper</span>
<span class="depth-60">Or the name of the boy that the very first song I released with car seat headrest was written  for</span>
<span class="depth-60">I bump into a man to try and obtain a rolling</span>
<span class="depth-60">Rolling stone</span>
<span class="depth-60">Paper to shroud my swaddling</span>
<span class="depth-60">I am not</span>
<span class="depth-60">Crying</span>
<span class="depth-60">Who is this person</span>
<span class="depth-60">This was all a test</span>
<span class="depth-60">Or a reminder</span>
<span class="depth-60">Or a semaphore or the return</span>
<span class="depth-60">The reel reversed</span>
<span class="depth-60">Lykke li plays</span>
<span class="depth-60">Forward this time. Forward</span>
<span class="depth-60">And to my right after I perform a small ritual</span>
<span class="depth-60">(Hidden, miniature version of the grandeur I placed at my altar)</span>
<span class="depth-60">I see a birdcage</span>
<span class="depth-60">Like the one never hung up in place as promised by Bear</span>
<span class="depth-60">That’s been sitting on my kitchen floor that I finally swept for the first time in maybe three months</span>
<span class="depth-60">Dancing</span>
<span class="depth-60">Kneeling and dancing</span>
<span class="depth-60">To the washing machine drum</span>
<span class="depth-60">Beating in rhythm with my heart and the machine</span>
<span class="depth-60">Learnt from aeons of nightmares and engineer dreams</span>
<span class="depth-60">Outside there are two large red</span>
<span class="depth-60">rings,  not quite aligned, but opposite</span>
<span class="depth-60">Not quite meeting, but next to one another</span>
<span class="depth-60">Is this parallel</span>
<span class="depth-60"></span>
<span class="depth-60">Am I seeing patterns where no body asked me</span>
<span class="depth-60">Delusion of reference - Hindsight</span>
<span class="depth-60">Am I being called by a silence</span>
<span class="depth-60">Murid leaves and I think about what to drink</span>
<span class="depth-60">I see the shelves and on the top right is a bottle</span>
<span class="depth-60">Named chAos</span>
<span class="depth-60">With the A outlined, again, screaming at me</span>
<span class="depth-60">George with a frog tattoo saying queer people always ask about the frog first and non-queers ask about what drink he’s sitting in</span>

<span class="depth-60">How I’ve strangled all life with just trying to breathe</span>
<span class="depth-60">Top of the hill now, the latest I’ve been climbing</span>
<span class="depth-60">I thought I saw someone on the right of me</span>
<span class="depth-60">I thought there was somebody</span>
<span class="depth-60">Walking beside me</span>
<span class="depth-60">But no</span>
<span class="depth-60">At least not if any corporeal form</span>
<span class="depth-60">As the song now playing says</span>

<span class="depth-60">In gold</span>
<span class="depth-60">At the top of the hill the name of the street is Pitt and I walk past King Tuts where our very last date was</span>

<span class="depth-60">I fucking</span>
<span class="depth-60">Miss it</span>
<span class="depth-60">Not it</span>
<span class="depth-60">But the part that you held in it</span>
<span class="depth-60">And the part I just</span>
<span class="depth-60">Tried but just</span>
<span class="depth-60">Never could fit</span>
<span class="depth-60">And I feel myself slipping as I type this so I step forward and move my body and try</span>
<span class="depth-60">To remember</span>
<span class="depth-60">This pain is a pleasure</span>
<span class="depth-60">This pain to be felt is a tape is a measure</span>
<span class="depth-60">And I’m winding into something bigger</span>
<span class="depth-60">I’m winding around</span>
<span class="depth-60">Growing up into cycles</span>
<span class="depth-60">But reel and</span>
<span class="depth-60"> much thinner</span>
<span class="depth-60">And there, as I simmer</span>
<span class="depth-60">as the light starts to feel dimmer</span>
<span class="depth-60">It shimmers:</span>

<span class="depth-60">Tells me to stand there cold</span>
<span class="depth-60">And frozen in place</span>
<span class="depth-60">And I realise it’s the same street you work on</span>

<span class="depth-60">In front is also the place where my new life has sprung from</span>
<span class="depth-60">She works at a place with a logo inverted in the same shape that’s following me at my end</span>
<span class="depth-60">In the place of your face that was so achingly absent</span>
<span class="depth-60">So pretty , I remember that shimmer of back-shone kitchen light</span>
<span class="depth-60">I spent so many nights in that kitchen</span>
<span class="depth-60">With {REDACTED} mostly</span>

<span class="depth-60">What a farce</span>
<span class="depth-60">What a shady vast shadowy sshining small place I have been</span>
<span class="depth-60">So scary at times</span>
<span class="depth-60">And so handsome</span>
<span class="depth-60">And there I see her</span>
<span class="depth-60">And make a joke about complaining about the service</span>
<span class="depth-60">And she turns around and I see maybe the first friendly face that I could be sure of I’ve seen in over a month</span>
<span class="depth-60">And I throw up my arm in that same angel gesture</span>
<span class="depth-60">And my height and my size being too much for the ceiling I hit the red</span>
<span class="depth-60">lamp which is not quite spherical but warped into an almost-ring</span>
<span class="depth-60"></span>
<span class="depth-60">And my heart it is singing</span>
<span class="depth-60">And my harp string is ringing</span>
<span class="depth-60">I know for some reason</span>
<span class="depth-60">And then I look to my left</span>
<span class="depth-60">Of course it’s my left</span>

<span class="depth-60">His surname:</span>
<span class="depth-60">Ward]</span>
<span class="depth-60">Yesterday was almost more dreamlike than the story I just apparently woke from</span>
<span class="depth-60">I walked through a path I’d never seen before I needed the darkness of containment of the absence of light to show me the way</span>
<span class="depth-60">I walked through a gap in the trees and thought of Fae mythology I held out my right hand as my left tried to record with a camera in case through device like a celestial telegram telling me to</span>
<span class="depth-60">Stop</span>
<span class="depth-60">Start</span>
<span class="depth-60">My life and my art are becoming One</span>
<span class="depth-60">Or</span>
<span class="depth-60">They always were</span>
<span class="depth-60">This work is spilling out into reel life like the pipe that has burst with the furling of the Sun</span>
<span class="depth-60">Anyway coming back from this fine-and-welcome interruption to my dancing round my alter (which, by the way is a wooden double-levelled table shaped in a Hexagon - Six Times Two, The Twelve scaffolded in supporting opposition)</span>
<span class="depth-60">I am drinking coffee now but then, when I was at the time of writing a few lines back I was pouring coffee while drinking a derivative of opium - codeine and paracetamol - derived from poppies, and the laboratory</span>
<span class="depth-60">Pouring into my future-emptied cup as I drank from one</span>
<span class="depth-60">At the time I had not given thought to The Star’s tarot symbol</span>
<span class="depth-60">And to my left the drum~ the drum! The washing machine drum,</span>
<span class="depth-60">Still closed</span>
<span class="depth-60">I’d not taken the clothes out in time, like I’d planned to have done</span>
<span class="depth-60">I grin like a madwoman</span>
<span class="depth-60">So at peace with my plans of bettering crumbling</span>
<span class="depth-60">But, centring my resolve to bring my body and my soul into some semblance of greater balance (as I’m cradled by my looping thoughts of Goethe and of Newton, imagining a scene where they’re waltzing in a ballroom alone)</span>
<span class="depth-60">And I try to open the not-quite full binbag of trash collected just before leaving for the hospital in London</span>
<span class="depth-60">And accidentally (yeah, right, I know better know, or worse somehow, I just can’t stop keep writing all this poetry for the half-heard and not looked for generation that’s to come)</span>
<span class="depth-60">I rip the opening too wide, splitting</span>
<span class="depth-60">And I aloud say “oops” and laugh, unwitting</span>
<span class="depth-60">Covering it in the swaddle plastic cloth of a branded black and new one</span>
<span class="depth-60">Witch</span>
<span class="depth-60">By light of whitest magick</span>
<span class="depth-60">*as is everything, all the wrongs and Rites that I have ever and by the time this all is writ I will have done</span>
<span class="depth-60">It’s my last one</span>
<span class="depth-60">My life has been a symphony of energy tight-laddered-broken rung potentials justly aching, begging all the time to be sung, be sung, be sung</span>
<span class="depth-60">And then the undulation of a single finch alters me to another (maybe just the same) grey gull</span>
<span class="depth-60">Now facing away, with a magpie on the eright</span>
<span class="depth-60">Probably the same little guy that welcomed me in the ending of last night</span>
<span class="depth-60">To land, once more atop the angel poised and ready to take flight in reaching, reaching, reaching</span>
<span class="depth-60">I go to do my superstitious salute and realise both the gull and magpie they are gone</span>
<span class="depth-60">_The shroud, the pipe, the organ - they need holes, they need cracks to let the laying eggs of waste out, or at least someone in_</span>
<span class="depth-60">_The trumpets of drosophila herald change that is a steady shore of lore that’s sure to come_</span>
<span class="depth-60">As Phil sings about symbols recurring throughout his life and building his own mythology, and I think of him, and them, and me, and Jung</span>
<span class="depth-60">He sings into both of my ears, caressing them:</span>
<span class="depth-60">_Myths come true_</span>
<span class="depth-60">I get a phone call, the line is unheard, unhearable</span>
<span class="depth-60">But in the distance in the cold and lower altitude outside I can hear the semblance of the voice I’d heard before and I crane my painful neck down from the window, he can hear me but not me hymn, it seems</span>
<span class="depth-60">I laugh as he performs some form of sign language telling me to turn the faucet on</span>
<span class="depth-60">I obey, and open my window just a crack to cold air, and behind a cloud, the Sun</span>
<span class="depth-60">Pausing Phil I hear the good news (small, for me, but not for someone)</span>
<span class="depth-60">He can see he’s been given the wrong location</span>
<span class="depth-60">It is in truth my neighbour who has the plumbing problem</span>
<span class="depth-60">I shout through the crack to the creek of that verbose and loose artery running down from the window</span>
<span class="depth-60">Arnas texts to say she can’t quite make the visit to the Forest today but would I like to see a waterfall near her house instead and I sent her this draft but without this line because I wrot ethics after Ward had told me the small good news</span>
<span class="depth-60">In the dream one of the psychiatrists from the hospital was dressed as a champagne bottle (since Halloween but still was)</span>
<span class="depth-60">Someone tried to ask her quite nicely about it and she started to cry as if this ridiculous costume was in dedication to someone lost</span>
<span class="depth-60">In the waking world I drink a shot of ginger</span>
<span class="depth-60">Like the ones you and {REDACTED} had made for yourselves</span>
<span class="depth-60">And chase it with the juice of an apple now regarding the wind chime which I fixed and placed in a new, ,backward facing position,</span>
<span class="depth-60">The white side pointing inward, black side outward, seems to say “look out into the light”</span>
<span class="depth-60">So I do, and see that much-before seen sight</span>
<span class="depth-60">The blackened, singed and burned automotive repair shop which once had housed the greatest and most roaring fire my eyes had ever gazed upon</span>
<span class="depth-60">In fear and such ancient reverence</span>
<span class="depth-60">The Ashen shroud covered the word DEB’S which was the name of one of the cafeteria workers who remembered my name and always injected a smile onto my face in moonful sunshine mirror of reflection</span>
<span class="depth-60">And to the right, another place, called A. GRAY</span>
<span class="depth-60">My ‘E’ key is stuck again</span>
<span class="depth-60">Out of the washing machin drum I pull my pair of bought for myslf burgundy pyjamas as if knowing I was haded for a rstful dstination</span>
<span class="depth-60">And out comes an auxiliary cable, umbilical, resembling (and I think it’s the same at first) one of those red</span>
<span class="depth-60">elastic strings I’d come across in the woods in the clearing next to the 10mph sign which was the distant view of writing most of this story although by the time it’s done I know it will represent just an infinitesimal fraction of this magnum of my odyssey of insanity and ancestral reclamation </span>
<span class="depth-60">And then I pull out the red</span>
<span class="depth-60">robe entangled with countless pairs of fishnets and black tights and Jesus Christ this is all too much poetry for me to try to contain I really must get these menial tasks done and come down to life that must just be dust particles floating in a long lost son</span>
<span class="depth-60">I put in the second load, the last</span>
<span class="depth-60">From the soil of load I’d carried back</span>
<span class="depth-60">And then I see Tofu, Isla</span>
<span class="depth-60">Oh Islands of my Becoming</span>
<span class="depth-60">I’d done you so wrong in our connection</span>
<span class="depth-60">A google drive collaborative journal I can’t bring myself to open</span>
<span class="depth-60">I’d become my Welsh-inherited ex-partners reflection and that was a daffodil I could not bear to be hunted by or look upon</span>
<span class="depth-60">Any longer  of a life together and I’d have died</span>
<span class="depth-60">I start the whirring of the drum</span>
<span class="depth-60">On setting ‘2’ now and remember how you’d said it’s okay we can wait I can wait to wash them</span>
<span class="depth-60">Your treasured childhood possession</span>
<span class="depth-60">I wrapped them in a pillowcase, not to hide them but to protect them, Like I had with Colin already</span>
<span class="depth-60">I think about your allergies and all the smoke that I’d thoughtlessly blown about the room that Tofu placed gently on a shelf I couldn’t handle their presence in my bed any longer and in my reckless wrecked and wretched wrung with no-wrung-or-wing out of that place I</span>
<span class="depth-60">Thought that your wanting space was the same as the one I shouldn’t have ever named</span>
<span class="depth-60">I thought you needed physical space from me in bed for the repulsion at my skin but it was your own skin’s repulsion at the chemicals I contained within or hadn’t washed off in my</span>
<span class="depth-60">Mania</span>
<span class="depth-60">You used to call me Maniac</span>
<span class="depth-60">With such love</span>
<span class="depth-60">As I pulled out glass from my feet from that night’s performance where I’d accidentally or perhaps on purpose stepped on a lightbulb and smashed it into my skin while screaming half-contained within a cage that had an accordion bound to the bars which I pushed against gravity and pulled down with it and pulled myself down with it I was naked save for a set of symbols laid upon my deranged and scarred body and containing all the shame of my genitalia within inguinal canals of rivers of rivers of rivers about to be released from me</span>
<span class="depth-60">Containment - expansion - expression - retention - vertical stake holding place of horizon - god - do these cycles ever end?</span>
<span class="depth-60">A stone woman gives birth to a child at night</span>
<span class="depth-60">When I’d dream</span>
<span class="depth-60">There was a dog</span>
<span class="depth-60">A few dogs</span>
<span class="depth-60">One of whom knew how to turn the lights on and off</span>
<span class="depth-60">Chinaski - the name of a writers alter ego</span>
<span class="depth-60">Sin, Sine</span>
<span class="depth-60">Have I written about the bat I saw above the pond of bodies yet?</span>
<span class="depth-60">I really must not forget to include that most divine encounter</span>
<span class="depth-60">I whispered to him</span>
<span class="depth-60">And then catching myself I just spoke at my normal all-surrounding resonance of din</span>
<span class="depth-60">I just want to say something true</span>
<span class="depth-60">I said something true to the bat</span>
<span class="depth-60">As he flapped, blind, but seeing More with his unheard hald-herd clicks than the sight of my own human eyes could have ever knew</span>
<span class="depth-60">Cones for red</span>
<span class="depth-60">, for green, and those for blue</span>
<span class="depth-60">But he just had the click of his tongue and made do</span>
<span class="depth-60">No, surpassed my paths of forking</span>
<span class="depth-60">Tongues</span>
<span class="depth-60">We spoke to one another in tongues</span>
<span class="depth-60">After I’d passed through</span>
<span class="depth-60">That gap of Janus in the blackened hues of maybe oak or Yews</span>
<span class="depth-60">I fall asleep again and think I’ve written way more down than I have, semi-waking to my mouth rambling to my brain</span>
<span class="depth-60">Notification: your payment plan for Scottish Goat Company is resuming</span>

<span class="depth-60">Being pulled to pulling of my cards again while editing this document, El Diablo photograph alerting me to The Devil burned into the box of card on my left side, where peeking like a crow beak from the slit, the rip in the wood is the stalk of that dead but so living leaf I kept from the threshold to the realm of Kali</span>
<span class="depth-60">Lifting up the box underneath is Ramayya’s Sacred Words, States of the Body</span>
<span class="depth-60">I place my right hand upon it and breathe holy air like a criminal about to give testament</span>
<span class="depth-60">I shuffle the cards in my usual way, three times with the deck pointed west, three times south, three times East and three times North makes twelve and then I pull a single card and realise, that’s enough</span>
<span class="depth-60">That’s all I need – Stained with the brown rotted suggestion of rose petals from the grounds of that place that left such holy holes in me</span>
<span class="depth-60">There, my sea</span>

<span class="depth-60">Sticking a tattoo needle I used during rituals of that time I hunt the halls of my then-barely recognisable diamond prism of a prison of a rough ore mine rough mind to find the needle in a stacked barrel – I stick the needle into the binbag within the other binbag, to ensure it doesn’t pierce the outer layer to let the dirty contents out on my final descent to the dust to dustbin- a sword resting, peacefully, for safety not for secrets, in the stone.</span>

<span class="depth-60">After holding the plate in front of you in gratitude you speak the two words Thank You aloud, addressing No One but the Earth. Which of course, is everyone. You devour both halves, first left, then right. Separately. Bringing them together inside yourself, you are filled.

<span class="depth-60">ý In Typography a ligature is a single glyph or character that is formed by joining two or more letters or graphemes. For example, the characters ⟨æ⟩ and ⟨œ⟩ are ligatures that join the letters ⟨a⟩ and ⟨e⟩, and ⟨o⟩ and ⟨e⟩, respectively. Ligatures are often used in OpenType fonts to improve the appearance of characters that visually collide when used together. In medicine a ligature is a medical procedure that involves using a suture to secure a blood vessel before dividing it. It can also refer to tying string or dental floss around a skin tag to cut off blood circulation.

<span class="depth-60">X The word “consonant” comes from the Latin root consonare, meaning “to sound together” or “to agree.” This root can be broken down further - “Con-”: a Latin prefix meaning “together” or “with.” - “Sonare”: a Latin verb meaning “to sound.” Originally, consonare referred to sounds that were “sounding together,” signifying harmony or agreement. This idea of sounding together is foundational to both meanings of consonant:</span>
<span class="depth-60">Consonance in Sound (Linguistic): Consonants, in a linguistic sense, “sound together” with vowels to form syllables and words. Unlike vowels, which can be voiced alone, consonants typically need to be paired with a vowel to be fully articulated. In this sense, they are in “agreement” or “harmony” with vowels, creating the building blocks of words.</span>
<span class="depth-60">Consonance in Agreement (Abstract): The concept of things being in agreement or harmonious extends from this “sounding together” notion. Just as consonants need to work with vowels in language, people or ideas that are in “consonance” are in harmony, aligning or “sounding together” metaphorically.</span>
<span class="depth-60">Thus, the Y-branchY connecting these meanings lies in the concept of harmonious sound or agreement, whether literal (in linguistic sounds) or figurative (in aligned ideas). The Latin origin is where the concept diverges into its linguistic use (as a type of letter) and its abstract use (as being in agreement), each stemming from the foundational idea of “sounding together.”</span>
<span class="depth-60">Y Y itself is a branch-letter hybrid that’s neither vowel nor consonant, the first nor the second, but in penultimacy, semi-animacy, half-heard but half-breathed, between two waves which have been separated - X and Z</span>

They were previously placed in a separate superfamily, Hesperioidea; however, the most recent taxonomy places the family in the superfamily Papilionoidea, the butterflies. They are named for their quick, darting flight habits. Much like a finch, sparrow, witch His/Her Eye Is On. Most have their antenna tips modified into narrow unbaited hooks of projections. These bi-winged things mostly have an absence of wing-coupling structure present in Others of their Family.</span>
