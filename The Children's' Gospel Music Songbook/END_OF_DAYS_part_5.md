<span class="depth-49">Again</span>
<span class="depth-49">In order to shed more light on my satchel</span>
<span class="depth-49">I find no such flimsy and flammable thing</span>
<span class="depth-49">But I do find some kindling, more leaves never leaving</span>
<span class="depth-49">Just staying their place in this load that I’m carrying</span>
<span class="depth-49">And I think again of the chains placed so loosely with weighting</span>
<span class="depth-49">In the wait to be</span>
<span class="depth-49">Lifted</span>
<span class="depth-49">Arisen</span>
<span class="depth-49">Im sifting</span>
<span class="depth-49">Through memory contained in these objects of longing</span>
<span class="depth-49">REVO (or OVER reversed is now playing)</span>
<span class="depth-49">And I see my provisional</span>
<span class="depth-49">Divine providence vision on</span>
<span class="depth-49">My purse, zip long broken</span>
<span class="depth-49">My plastic card slipping from</span>
<span class="depth-49">Within confines of identity id placed upon</span>
<span class="depth-49">It, er sie ist</span>
<span class="depth-49">Ich bin ein und du bist</span>
<span class="depth-49">Of the wrist</span>
<span class="depth-49">The first to break upon falling</span>
<span class="depth-49">And the last one to mend, for a reason,</span>
<span class="depth-49">The calling</span>
<span class="depth-49">The treason a Rite ink desk I previously wrote on, a lesson</span>
<span class="depth-49">That the goddess beheading is wearing tritone</span>
<span class="depth-49">Of devilish blessings strung through all the skeletons</span>
<span class="depth-49">Of heads the men’s skulls of becoming attention</span>
<span class="depth-49">Be coming</span>
<span class="depth-49">A tension</span>
<span class="depth-49">This is where my notes rest, under the monstrously focused spotlights fluoresce</span>
<span class="depth-49">As my battle with chariot charging my battery’s lost again</span>
<span class="depth-49">Pay attention</span>
<span class="depth-49">They’re saying</span>

<span class="depth-49">Not that witch</span>
<span class="depth-49">The eye can sea</span>
<span class="depth-49">But that by which the</span>
<span class="depth-49">I can see</span>

<span class="depth-49">Hermes, thrice great</span>
<span class="depth-49">Everything works as a dance, Oh so perfectly</span>
<span class="depth-49">Walking back I realise where I’ve been living (not living, not really)</span>
<span class="depth-49">The street perpendicular to mine’s deeper meaning</span>
<span class="depth-49">KINGARTH ST</span>
<span class="depth-49">Saint, King, Arthur</span>
<span class="depth-49">Check it, Marked Your Ex-Painted Spot</span>
<span class="depth-49">Remembering you changing your WhatsApp profile photo to the image of you holding a wooden sword high above you at the gathering of that now long lost cult in the forest that gathering I just couldn’t bring myself to break into and now I know why I know why I wasn’t meant to and I am so sorry I am so sorry for and to all of you</span>
<span class="depth-49">I beat the sickness</span>
<span class="depth-49">The E key on my keyboard (lexicographic, not musical) is sticking again</span>
<span class="depth-49">I’m not making any of this up but shaken it’s making me</span>
<span class="depth-49">Maybe nobody will feel this divinity but that doesn’t matter I’m feeling it all for me</span>
<span class="depth-49">For them</span>
<span class="depth-49">For they are Hear and have always been</span>
<span class="depth-49">Own, Righted</span>
<span class="depth-49">Stripped R</span>
<span class="depth-49">Are</span>
<span class="depth-49">Knighted, black and whited to</span>
<span class="depth-49">Be</span>
<span class="depth-49">Known</span>
<span class="depth-49">A s</span>
<span class="depth-49">The Stone Stuck with Swordtooth Comes Looser,</span>
<span class="depth-49">To Choose Her</span>
<span class="depth-49">Two Chew, Sir</span>
<span class="depth-49">TO ADD – LIDL RECEIPT</span>
<span class="depth-49">Before entering my horizon again I exchange the placement of my own rings</span>
<span class="depth-49">Rose now on right, dragon or serpent or kraken on left</span>
<span class="depth-49">Marrying myself</span>
<span class="depth-49">A gain</span>
<span class="depth-49">The first thing that enters my body is pulverised Apple</span>
<span class="depth-49">(witch A is for)</span>
<span class="depth-49">And then first, dessert, I’m starting from where I should end</span>
<span class="depth-49">And then one of the autumn leaves collected by moisture of the Heart’s Jarring swaddling cloth showed me next in the sequence of eating-  the black pork-</span>
<span class="depth-49">Squealing down throat singing forking pathways of checkerchopped board into Life</span>
<span class="depth-49">In the Lowness of pH</span>
<span class="depth-49">The acidic and arid and place</span>
<span class="depth-49">Where</span>
<span class="depth-49">Every</span>
<span class="depth-49">Body is just</span>
<span class="depth-49">Waiting</span>
<span class="depth-49">Celeste by Charlotte Jacobs (bookending the earlier occurrence of her song Owl – the O – the howling eyes of God’s guise in me)</span>
<span class="depth-49">Comes on by itself</span>
<span class="depth-49">And only at first, again, the last lyric is heard by my unravelled self</span>
<span class="depth-49">‘We Are Here’</span>
<span class="depth-49">-Which I raise to the sky in fullness as I had my emptied fist</span>
<span class="depth-49">And say thank you ancestors for this flesh I shall merge with my own as a gift</span>
<span class="depth-49">I eat the whole thing, though with breaks to wipe stake-sticking oil of the burned and broken cured body from fingers to write of this tryst</span>
<span class="depth-49">Three rows of flesh – different but One</span>
<span class="depth-49">Salami – Pork Loin – Garvaõ</span>
<span class="depth-49">I eat from the right, middle, left, down to left, middle right, weaving like a blanket’s thread trail or genetic tail might</span>
<span class="depth-49">I close my eyes and feel the saliva washing over the not-gone but part of me pig to return her to some ocean</span>
<span class="depth-49">Of salt</span>
<span class="depth-49">Closing my eyes I see a tree</span>
<span class="depth-49">As the words of the song I am hearing or being sung tell me ‘please, breathe’</span>
<span class="depth-49">So Far – flashmob</span>
<span class="depth-49">And in heeding, or reading or hearing their asking, I breathe in and again close my eyes to find:</span>
<span class="depth-49">An A</span>
<span class="depth-49">An Other A</span>
<span class="depth-49">Something within m reaches out to grab the jar of sliced</span>
<span class="depth-49">pickle</span>
<span class="depth-49">(at one time this was your name for me)</span>
<span class="depth-49">Lamenting just for a second the fact that now my favourite food is itself pickled in memory of you</span>
<span class="depth-49">And Back to the Fermented Cucumber, Cooling my heat</span>
<span class="depth-49">I eat three, obviously</span>
<span class="depth-49">Back to the restraint and coldness of preservation I place them</span>
<span class="depth-49">Automatically picking up next in the sequence of meal-beads – the cheese</span>
<span class="depth-49">Simply so I could make the line rhyme in my life’s rose of poetry</span>
<span class="depth-49">I can’t get into the packet so I use the same knife which scraped on the E</span>
<span class="depth-49">I eat just one slice, curdled children to unity</span>
<span class="depth-49">Garlanded by blackest peppered in credulity</span>
<span class="depth-49">Returning her yellowing paper thin to the re</span>
<span class="depth-49">Fridge, almost full I regard the red</span>
