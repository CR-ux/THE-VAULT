<span class="depth-20">I said be careful, it’s unsteady, and I think and hope we both knew what that really meant</span>
<span class="depth-20">Oh christ how I loved that human</span>
<span class="depth-20">So rarely do we see another one so close and so long</span>
<span class="depth-20">Oh – too short but just so long</span>
<span class="depth-20">But I’m riding this train for the feeling</span>
<span class="depth-20">Somehow on the train</span>
<span class="depth-20">I know how, by now, it’s them, the queens and kings and monarchs wound in circles through the woven his/hers/theirs/tones of my transcending all transmutation genome-coded brain</span>
<span class="depth-20">So by their light I arrived i-am-in perfect time, by magick, just the same</span>
<span class="depth-20">Imparted Oars of soaring roses owed in sorrow-sweetvoiced by countless Othered name</span>
<span class="depth-20">And in imitated upturned card of bent down transitory Tower, wow-so-tired-wonder-how-my-reeling-wheels-weren’t-howling-ouch-my-vertebrae-are-braying-hymns-to-Sisyphus I push my suitcase in katabatic manic parody</span>
<span class="depth-20">And there, halfway from the top’s a fleet of angels call to stop, and opts to ease my POTS-syncopated heartache beat</span>
<span class="depth-20">Says hey! You’ll do your back in! backing Sister Rosetta humming and translating communication from a place ineffable</span>
<span class="depth-20">I say aloud my gratitude and You Are an Angel as he asks me the location of my halting, clearly seeing maybe scenting as a guard dog all the distance laid both back and front of me</span>
<span class="depth-20">G and U are unreserved and they’re closer to where we’re standing so you have less far to go with this weight</span>
<span class="depth-20">I repeat the spoken sentiment and lift my case, mine alone and real again to take</span>
<span class="depth-20">G for Glasgow U for Up or really, just a shape</span>
<span class="depth-20">Discussed just one, two, fleeting hours before in one-to-one with frances - free one</span>
<span class="depth-20">Just a symbol for a crucible</span>
<span class="depth-20">Or a vessel</span>
<span class="depth-20">You</span>
<span class="depth-20">And Eye</span>
<span class="depth-20">And I and Oh, me, O, a Ring</span>
<span class="depth-21">– a Ring</span>
<span class="depth-22">with space within, kept safe inside</span>
<span class="depth-22">I will forever be Unç</span>
<span class="depth-22">Bound –</span>
<span class="depth-22">to this memory of sign of</span>

<span class="depth-22">Were and are a place for change to take</span>
<span class="depth-22">Hold of you just holding me</span>
<span class="depth-22">I think that’s the main facet of this faucet tapping at my engine start of Grief</span>
<span class="depth-22">Just beholding all the kissing and just missing how you’d hold me</span>
<span class="depth-22">Ladies and gentlemen</span>
<span class="depth-22">I think of you again, how we’d share some seething gentle sarcasm about you not existing</span>
<span class="depth-22">Were you a dream? A nightmare? I really don’t want to slip into cliché but again, remembering that bed not mine not yours either but the one sat on for a moment by shelley saying cliches must be cliches for a reason must be seasons fleeting must be riding must be writing must be just muse</span>
<span class="depth-22">Our Train is now running Ten</span>
<span class="depth-22">I close my eyes, the imaged ex in Mandelbrot ink blotted Rorschach rotted skin spotlight of black retina-reception geometric shape</span>
<span class="depth-22">Mandel – German or Scandinavian origin – Little Almond</span>
<span class="depth-22">Not the nut that the crow performed ritual with in front of me</span>
<span class="depth-22">Cracking the shell with the blackness of beak</span>
<span class="depth-22">But still, nonetheless, some connection to witch through the concept of allergy</span>

<span class="depth-22"> minutes delayed</span>
<span class="depth-22">I make the six-carriage journey, rocking, rolling back and forth, gathering some sort of moss in my reactionary dancing in embers of memory through avoiding all the voiceless faces staring into my sunglasses-shield</span>
<span class="depth-22">Meeting the Glaswegian accented lady welcoming me not just in face not just in voice but just in the marrow of my bones – as we pull into all of the intersections of reminders of York -  I remember that Scotland is really where the dust of my soles must be longing for</span>
<span class="depth-22">I’ll give you such a smack</span>

<span class="depth-22">I want to move to the forest</span>
<span class="depth-22">Write book after book and grow mushrooms and maybe weed but God it’s been a month since I’ve even smoked any, maybe that was more than anything exactly what I needed to receive the necessary messages from ancestors lost I’d once found a blessing</span>

<span class="depth-22">Not of Soul or Sole but Salt</span>
<span class="depth-22">And then to Sulphur with no Mercury</span>
<span class="depth-22">But now,</span>
<span class="depth-22">I see</span>
<span class="depth-22">The Way</span>
<span class="depth-22">Is into, through the Body</span>
<span class="depth-22">Not using plants, but rather (if the feeling ever should take me)</span>
<span class="depth-22">Letting the concrescence of their essence use the rest in me</span>
<span class="depth-22">In Testament, Testimony</span>
<span class="depth-22">Sacrament, in Sanctity</span>
<span class="depth-22">I left a note under a tape under an apple on my bed that said</span>

<span class="depth-23">I tilled it with my tongue</span>
<span class="depth-23">There was no one there to dispute my claim</span>
<span class="depth-23">The whole place just cleared right out</span>
<span class="depth-23">I laid there by a fallen spring</span>
<span class="depth-23">No ring</span>
