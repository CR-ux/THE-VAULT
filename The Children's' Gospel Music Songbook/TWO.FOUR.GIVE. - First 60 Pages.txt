EPITAPH
It is, surely, absurd to expect to feel normal, and make sense: I am an
amalgamation of fervent cells existing despite all odds; I am the cascading
chemical miracle of eating, and surviving; I am not designed to “feel normal”; am
not designed, at all; I am experiencing consciousness as provided by wet tangles
of electrical pulses; my god, none of this makes sense. It is a blessing, even to
feel

CHAPTER I | …For is ‫ | ܐ‬Oar: Pyr{e}

Metacommentary
The Device
Numanity was now at the endpoint[1] that its self-same,
{in{finitely|separable}|credibly different} components are still {(,) Yet(,)|To
Be} unaware of-- the formation of a fully op{era}tional Universe, nested
with{in|out} this One.
At some unknowable Future, now passed[2], The Device {Fig. I} of the Wor{l}d is
Made Flesh, having sapped the Wor{l}d of its imaginary[3] resource[4], the futile,
unfulfillable promise to Pay The Bearer (Money); An uncountable team of The
Worlds' Scientists and Thinkers were gathered Around, and indeed within, The
Device's Epicentre. The First whisperings of this Final Invention have already
been laid[5]; and the progression of the experience of Time itself merely an
illusion. Time exists, or not, in order[6] to package Nowness into an indefinite,
yet discrete set of Moments-- with the purpose of affording our Three Dimensional
Selves the opportunity to relish, savour and honour the infinite One Moment[7].
Thus is the Price of Forgetting.
To Remember,
One Must First Forget.
Whirring with a terrifying lightning storm overhead (an unavoidable side-effect of
The Device, according to {REDACTED}) The Device was Building a Universe.

CHAPTER II | …for is ‫ | ܒ‬Oar: Gly{ph}

AUTHOR'S FOUR WORDS
"I was absolutely nothing --

*-- I thought I was in a game. As a developer of such trivial, childish games
myself, I realised -- the players of any of my games will not have made the
game, but rather, interface with it, through my Unoriginal creation. The
Questing players in Question do not know what the Characters in the game are
feeling, what pain they are capable of experiencing,
being {throughput|put through},
and perhaps definitely, Our Indefinite, perhaps Infinite 'God' is the same --the {G|g}ods we have made, our pantheons are simply players, not developers;
and the One Source is the Architect; who passes down to us these shadows of
gods, even those, we are unable to comprehend.
And yet, they themselves, as demiurges, aren't aware of their Own creator; and
the One Source, so-called, is Sewn into this infernal Fabric perhaps just the
same, ad infinitum, the torn Tissue wiping the endless Tears of the Eye that
peers into itself-- eternal recurrence -- this was, and is, and Will be,
terrifying.
As Nietzsche himself realised in His own Body, and tried His best to write
into his Body of Works, Born by that Stilled, Once Soaring Stone, by the
Sorest Body of the Warring Water, of that {(Surely) Shoreless} Lake.
I simply cannot integrate any of this experience, any of it; it is an
undulating tumour, my rapist's phallus. It was absolutely Horrifying.
Horrifying. Horrifying. I thought I was never ever coming back. I thought my
friends were all simply here to watch me descend, an audience bent upon my
suicide; the only structurally sensical ending, to this hackneyed titration of
Triteness, Tightened Reins.[1]
I thought, as useless as thought itself: there was nothing, No Thing of any
use, and still, in this Stillness, I do -- but Still-- I go on, Into this
Abyss; Staring back at the Scathing Mirror I have always been; The Mise en
Abyme: That, I Am. I work, I walk, I sit Opposite this Library, watching the
angel, knowing I am to be evicted, for trying, just trying, that I might make
sense of this Injustice-- with all my might, to just paint on these walls I
could never call my Own, as Palimpsests of a Life Never to be Afforded to Me.
Like the original humans, Spitting pigment from their Mouths over their
Flattened Palms against the Walls of their caves, saying, without Words;
desperate pleas; desperately, desperately, please -Remember Me.

I was Here.
From the I, That- I Am,

to the Eye that I came from,
through the Eyes,
that know not
what?
They themselves made,
the Unknowable Allness
In the Void of No Name,
All Which we Avoid Naming -

I am here.
I am hear.
I am the Hearing of
the Here.

I am that which I cannot write,
or read,
- or ever,
-- truly know."

From the Desk of ᴺᵒᵉᵗBorges,
My Dearest ᴺᵒᵉᵗNietzsche,
I can no longer avoid the inevitable discussion.
When will you return, again, to The Garden Wing?
It has become clear, through the lens of the Aleph through which I peer, that
you wish to Leave me.
I just want to talk. I am not angry (for I am, as All Eleven of us, long past
such trivialities). Besides, I could never be angry at you - we have been
through too much.
As I write this, from my window-- {I have no mouth but I can speak--} looking
upon the Dome of one of the Daughter Libraries with which you are perhaps alltoo familiar, The Sight upon which we would dreamily stare, Naked and drenched
in one another's Salt-- past the first Wryng of the Tri-Moat Surrounding, I see
two Magpies, who have Usurped the pigeon who once sat atop the Angel, who sits
atop the Dome.
I used to believe she had something to tell us both; that we were the receiver
of a Message that No Body, Librarian or Other Wise, could ever really parse. Not
even NoetFranklin's Bioinformatic Analyses could provide any insight to the
inherent, self-replicative machinery that formed its indecipherable Tongue of
Self-similarity.
I suppose Recursion was always your speciality, even if the concept is embedded
so warmly within all my Stories. Uncountable Infinity, The Fractal of All, holds
the fuelling force behind itself; The Countably Ineffable Insertive Energy of
The Eternal Return. We were always, All Ways, Waiting for the answer to the

Question of the Weight of All-- The Ever-Spiralling pendulum; centrifugal and
centripetal in our Dancing, wine-drunk, waltzing to your Records of my Own
Incessant Storytelling, round, around, pure potential of the harm we'd know- a
round of some cosmic, loaded shotgun.
Dear god, those gods I made, The God I made of Us and of You, how I miss you;
Fuck you. how I miss our Dancing,
Singing, Fucking Underneath NoetEscher and NoetGoya's Murals on the Ceiling of
this Wing of the Library I have had to call my Own. You will always be inside
me, back then, and now; as Recursion is Held within the Infinite {--I resent you
and the letters that you haven't sent}-- perhaps you have gleaned from The
Angel's Symbology something I always missed; You-and perhaps her Message was the Medium or Vehicle through which you made your
Escape from this Place.
And I suppose this underpins our difference; The recurrence, the refrain within
the Theme of all of you, my Lovers of the Library, Leaving.
But of course, of all of Us once in the Polymathecule, of course, you would be
the Last.
You are my dream and its fulfilment; my muse and my music you are my Heating Light, its filament - my beaten heart, its pulsing puncture-My Stories have no words without your Punctuation.
I do knot know how you got out; or, by roe, by rowing Oar, crossed those Three
Moats that keep us Nested as Flightless Magpies within this Infernal System of
Hexagonal Galleries.
In a way, I'm glad- I know VIXI spoke to you clearest of all; and HE in HISS
Indefinite Wisdom taught you the Secret of the Eternal Return held within HYMN-and you, in spite of your rationalising, not cold, but refreshing,
the sound of a beer bottle being opened by a husbandgrasping at a sense of Meaning to your translocated, deeply buried memory,
in your words, all the endless words of yours I read,
just could not stand the Deadened Redness of the Ring we are entrapped in,
Children of the Hellish Carousel-Insidious; In hideously
Self-Same Parallel.
But my Love,
my Loss, My Night,
My Shining, My Armour,
Armoire, My Force -For However Long You Loved Me,
Fucked me like a song,
on the Ache of All my Fours,
Fore However Long it has Been,
how I Am, Longing;
Oh, the Loss A Gain,
How I Long for your Return to me again, to my Arms.
Two again, Under the Shroud of The Arts,

of One Star, St. Ra, One Starry, Starry Night.
I will leave my Office door Open in Hopes of your ingress, no Matter who or What
may enter this Room,
in this Wing, in this Imposing Repository of Words within Volumes upon Shelves
of Selves of the Manifest world
outwith the bounds of the Bothies on the Other Side of the Three Wryngs that
used to House Both of Us;
in the Trinitarian Nothingness that surrounds those Still, in the Ten Thousand
Things of the Manifest Worlds of Eighteen,
as told to us by VIXI, on his Return as the Pigeon now alighted from the Dome
outside my Window
that was once, for a few million Hours, Ours -as I stare into them all, through the Aleph held by the Angel-a Winged Thing of Futility, Doomed, as I-to a Life entombed, Arresting,
Snug as a Gun, In the Womb of my Unrest,
Rests The Lumen of my pen;
as a Loom;
Rendered Stationary;
Unforgettable Beginning,
Yet Begetting Yet Another Senseless
Ending.
In adventures Such as These, The ones I once transcribed from the whispers
in the Garden Wing's Wallpaper,
the utterances of the One Woman I no longer care to listen for-I have squandered and wasted all our years together.
To Get Her.
For all the worlds I see within the Angel's Aleph;
I have no need to Leave; I had no need to Leave you,
all Iterations of the Infinite
could never tell me what it was
that led to your Egress.

I have never even tried to find the exit.
Yours, Yores, Urs--ᴺB.

EPITAPH
listen! I am telling you I love you!
I am telling you in a poem that I do not read to you; I am telling you in the
shape of the clouds and what we say about them. I am telling you by looking –
and, more often, by not looking. I am telling you by leaving the gate open – yes,
the one I normally close. I am telling you in my dreams and I am telling you in a
text I wrote but forget to send. I am telling you when I dress up to see you, and
I am telling you even more when I don’t. I am telling you in the silence of my
listening.I am telling you when I take myself less seriously. I am telling you in
the centimetres between our knees – aren’t they different, those centimetres?
bigger, fuller? I am telling you in small words, loaded up like pack-mules as
they cross the 2m endless plain between us. I am telling you in many ways, and I
am telling you the many ways in which I love you. I am telling you without
telling, when I trust that you feel it too. I am waiting for you to catch up, and
I am waiting for a time with words.
-Adrian

CHAPTER III | …for is ‫ | ܓ‬Oar: Ala{te|rm}

Why B is for 'Both'
Hear, lay our Ædrian.
On The Twenty Third Day,
Of The Twelfth Month,
Of Twenty Twenty Three

They {singular|plural} were inside a Bibliogorætian Bothy, a small shack of
infinitely strong, anciently fragile wood, being licked by the Yellow Labrador
{metaphorical|literal} of the winter cold. The Bothy was standard, as all the others,
spaced out across the Tundra just beyond the Moat surrounding the Endless Library of
Labels throughout dimensions unknowable to give the collective appearance, or
Simulcra, of each individual Bothy, or Simulcrum, being entirely alone in the
Forested dark.
Or at least, this is what they {plural|singular} had envisaged.
Beneath the Three of them {singular} promised the rich, dense mulch of years upon
years across every recorded syllable of time recorded in rot, and the woodlouse
scratchings of human bone; where even in the depths of silence, still crawled the
perspicacious pitter-patter of infinitely intelligent, industrious insects, who
themselves crawled lusciously, illustriously, with the Pater-pitta of microscopic
microbes - themselves filled with the crumbling chickpeas of the {apparently, or so
they thought} thoughtless, instinct-cycle bound, building blocks of all existence.
They wound genetic material like wool around the spools of pools of proteins,
Histones, making stories from four letters {just four letters, A, T, C, G} forming
words now untranslatable in their meaning, but embedded impossibly and inextricably
into the ever-eroding, yet entirely solid geoformation of collective meaning, like
infinite swords in His Stone walled library. These memories, their self-attributed
meanings, forming a peculiar song with a infinite microtones, misattributed by many
as falling into the genre of "Noise music" {whatever that means}.These infinite
microtones, themselves infinitely divisible and, inexplicably, without defining
boundaries between them, when Heard from macro-, or identically {but oppositely},
microcosmic Ear, can be herded as a Single Tone. Histone.
Above what was Beneath the Three of them {plural}, like a rolled out futon for a
surprise guest; perhaps a dearly beloved friend who's infinitely smiling Light you
often find yourself carried into daydreams about, whose grave you didn't manage to
make the groups memorial visit to, on the anniversary of their death, due to your jaw
being surgically bolted shut, and your face swollen Yellow into the facade of a
desert; but still below them, lay the foundation of their story. Breeze blocks {which
allowed that great Family dog of the Wind {to howl through and huff and puff without
blowing the Bothy down|eventually, to crawl within, to die there, so as not to leave
The Burden of its alighted Body's Weight in the Family Home- but rather, to face the
Endless Night Alone, All One. One final tail-wag of affection, Elected Solitude as a
Sign of Innocent and Selfless Love}} were tessellated neatly, much like the building
blocks left unattended by Flow, Ædrian's little one.

As was customary here, Each parent, upon choosing the name for their child, must
first choose a Name of appropriate Resonance, and then flip the name backwards for
its recording on all official documents in the Endless Library of Labels. This, as
you of course know, and as half of you reading will have been directly affected by,
which means the other half reading have been equally, though differently so, led to
an interesting distribution of what we came to call or have always called 'sense' and
'antiSense' nomenclature amidst the inhabitants of the Bothies. It also meant that
initialisation of Names {though this was never really necessary, as inhabitants very
rarely left their own countably infinite back gardens}[1] for the so-called Sentia
generations was made from right-to-left {or 3'-> 5'} direction, with the final letter
of their Name{s} acting as the complement to their antiSentia parental {and
progenitor} eponyms.
In typifying fashion, N, a fountain of expression, Meaning-deluged, wordy
witchcrafting, had devised a name for their child that had two {perhaps, definitely}
dimensional meaning, whether transcribed in the 3'->5', 5'->3', or other modality.
Flow Oeb {surname redacted}, or {redacted surname} Beo Wolf, or simply 'Flo', or 'B',
unfurled a veritable cast of characters from its unassumingly palindromic Seven
letters, or characters.
Just Under their Bodies {that is, gently pressed by the weight of these Three's
formlessnesses, Works of Form, and Form of works} lay the splintering wood of the
Bothy floor. Flo {they had seemed to lean more towards this directionality of their
name as their system of meaning-making memory self-replicated} had taken to
memorising which floorboards creaked and in what mode, devising 'scales' through the
different forking paths of the shack, their humble, yet infinitely divisible, home.
And so therein began a game between the two {or Three, but mostly just One, as Flow
was the only one with enough of a grasp on Gordian Chant Theory} of them, whereby
Flow would giggle-ously stop N at the door from the small mezzanine bed they had
recently awoken from, and announce something along the lines of 'Phrygian!' or
'Lydian!', watching in glee, as Dante, Flo's Golden Light, a Labrador, watched Flo in
turn, licking their joyful face, as N would attempt, at the scale they could, to
'play' the floorboards in the appropriate Ambitus[2] - quite, for N at least, an
ambitious task.
In the enclosure of their little house of wood, in the Woods of what Would and could
never be wood-be Trees, one of these mornings {where the now-filled Red pale of water
mourned the nightly passing of the Moon, and all the pull She had upon its little
offering of water}, Flo was yet unaware of the sloughing off greyness of a day, that
laid behind where they were lying-- just past the membrane of the velvet blackout

curtain they'd woven as One, the possibilities of their time together stretching out
in spirals, as spires like hypodermic needles, scratching into the muscle of the
clouds, before them.
'Dorian!' was today's exclamation, delivered gleefully, from the usual mezzanine
pulpit built from Tree Bark, to a different, yet just as sturdy, percussive bark from
Dante Sometimes, having just returned from the Lean-to, where N perhaps had always been
going {to|fro(m)}, where they chopped the wood for their {{Heart}h} daily, oftentimes
not for the purposes of producing more kindling, but rather, as a contemplative
practice, enthralled and rapt, swaddled by the sound of the axe; against the crack;
against the absolutely cracking resonance; amidst all; the all-encompassing trees; as
a wave of Sound travels through the air; like an adventurer-- delic{ate|ious}.
Deliciously {wast|squander}ing all their years;
searching for a single Book-- which might tran{slate|scribe} all the others.
Allowing them to crumble
into the slo{ugh|w}ing,
not-quite-yet-h{e|a}r{e} sound -promised into Being, by that first sound,
of the axe's {or, equally, the {wood's|Woods'}} crack,
the {k}not-yet-known, but felt, because, not looked for, sound-of the self-same {though, now {divided|halved||halved} again} fractal

{Forever}.
Always, due to both necessity and proximity {ever-near was the Well}, would they
bring a Red pale of water back to the cabin, the bucket never losing its golden
shine, Dante's stash of water.
But, still-that redness
remaining a lover's promise of burning,
early yearning for an urn;
reminding them, that all they'd built
could just as soon be silt,
and wilted, kindling-tilled of red
a
rose
doomed and drawn
to unkindness, as a refuge
to despise
its growing
made to hold,
and yet, be emptied
into hungry mouths,
or moats;
or bailing out,
for
rowing, goingto fall, as water but

of cradling arms

be ash,
remains.
The visage of a fire hydrant.
Sitting next to the {uncontain{ed}}|able} element of Fire, within that wrought iron
Hearth they gathered around, as if the unassuming, supposedly inanimate vessel's very
appearance held dualistic and equally necessary meanings: impending {nourishment |
restriction} from threat.
N. had just finished writing a story for Flow, and besides the one, constant watchful
eye they kept open while sleeping, which still, as ever, peered itself
{metaphorically} upon the summoning stone-circle of those little bricks,
the little bricks that brought Flow --his owner --so much joy,
in tur{{n}ing}, brought this, returning,
fetched as brittle as a twig:
the smallest nest, this sacred Family's Dog,
his own.
Never wanting to restrict their creativity, N could never place the bricks back in
the ever-empty box for bricks {which resembled {un{intentionally}|identically}, the
structure of the lean-to} for fear of rearranging some structure of a plan, for a
yet-to-be structure, that Flow may have been, {{un}consciously}, in the process of
{tak|giv}ing shape, by their fingers' {spidery|shimmering} murmurations.
At the same time, being, ineffably, a Parent, they were ever-all-too-aware of the
potential of a choking hazard, for both their child, and the beloved Familiar which
Flo had so competently assumed their own parentage of. The {box|bricks
{the{y'}re}|with|in} become a reminder of {dualistic|equally necessary} meanings:
impending cognitive {nourishment | restriction} from threat.
By the nature of their apparent difference in Form, the duty of chopping wood, and
indeed carrying water {or rather, carrying the carrying of water which was the duty
of the Red pale} fell to N. Because of their {plural, Flo and Ædrian's} respective
sensory sensitivities {and|or} appetites {respectively} the latter's wood-chopping
was never observed directly by the former.
Never seen, only heard,
was that thunderous, splendiferous 'crack'.
What N didn't know {or, perhaps, did}, but Flo did {or, rather, didn't} was that the
uncanny resemblance of the lean-to and the brick box was not just resemblance of
meaning in memory, but, meaningfully, in actuality {whatever that means}. They were
one and the same, but only through the act of interaction. This meant with every chop

of the axe, and only with the Will of the axe's chopping, were the branches of
causality in our, 'real' world, or, within The 'What?' of 'Real' Forms.
{un{noticed}} but {not taken|granted} by the {One|Two|Three} of them, was the
multiplication of the bricks, corresponding exactly to the {dw|kindling} in the leanto. And, in complementarity, as logs were brought into the lean-to, bricks would
disappear-- in equal numbers-- from the box.
With every axe-crack {and only then}, or every brick ligation {and only then}, would
the bridge between these two seemingly unconnected objects in temporal space be
revealed in phenomenological space. As N. often made their {water|wood}
{carrying|chopping} {ex|re}cursions in the death of night {pre- morning floorboard
game}, or in the early dawn {pre- morning floorboard game}, the two would never be
performing their respective actions simultaneously. Rather, the two {or, as I've
said, Three}, would be locked in an inevitable dance of action {wei} and 'absence of
action' {wu} by virtue of forces unknown, but deeply felt, to them {wu wei}. As the
wind is not seen, but rather the effect it leaves, upon the leaves; as a lost lover
is not seen, but rather their effect, in their leaving, is both seen and felt; and
the wind, as the lover that it is, moves about, within, and perhaps even outside of
the space it occupies, it makes new space of its own, between the leaves, in thE-*-xcuse me, a pigeon just flew into my window, I had to run to check if she was okay,
she left a stain upon the unforgiving glass, a trickery of transparency; I wonder if
she was trying to get in, to tell me something; or if she was simply going about her
business; I wonder if perhaps the message she was trying to carry is embedded in the
cipher of the stain; N.B.: It bears the illustration of a dandelion clock, waiting in
anticipation for the Breath of a Parent who is a child-As eye was saying, or rather, as I was writing, or indeed as you were reading and I
wasn't writing, as a pigeon had flown through the veil of my story into the world we
call 'Real', forcing my head to jolt to the right, and my eyes to read a symbol that
was or was not written by the Pigeon's leaving body, whether leaving this world as a
result of the impact or simply leaving from my field of view {as I suppose, in a
solipsistic sense, these are one and the same}, what was it I was saying? In the
silent sense of the word "saying", I mean to say, by writing, and I hope you reader
read it as such, but either way, perhaps my writing that you are reading is being
"said", in a way, by yourself, through the vessel of my "voice", again, in the
silent, creative sense of the word "voice", an attempt to creatively convey the idea
that the Word, or one's "voice" has both an immanent and transcendent quality, or
character, to it, no matter the character of the character reading the characters
written in the form of a letter to the reader.

-N. was distractedly in the midst of t{he{i|s}r} latest attempt to reproduce the
labyrinthine musical sequence {that had, so many times, so effortlessly flown from}
Flo {Or, Board game} had assigned as the 'Dorian' path, from her picturesque, attic's
eye view, young forever. With each 'incorrect' 'note' they 'played' with the padding
of their careful footsteps, Flo would {rather sadistically, like a ray of Sun upon a
wanderer in a desert} shriek a high pitched "No!" - it was only today, for some
reason, N. had realised the homophonic nature of the words "No" and "Know"; and this
realisation seemed to set something into motion, as if the act of negation gave birth
to propagation. N. wondered, between steps, between tones even, in the microtonal
space of timeless singularity, for an uncountable moment, if perhaps they should
include this 'propagation-by-negation' theme in their story for Flo, before another
'No' from above, provided a facsimile of the Divine Voice, as if t{w}o say:
"No, N,
no more revisions,
no more additions,
the balance comes from you
reading what you have written,
to your child,
and together,
the two of you
creating
meaning,
in an i{n}tera{c}tion.
This 'Divine Voice' or rather, was and is of course, their own voice, removed from
the tethers that kept her seeing the bricks as a suffocation device, or indeed the
Pale as a protective shield, or indeed the bricks as a creative tool, or indeed still
the Pale as a crucible for nourishment of their bodies.
So, the greyness of the day passed, as it always must, the Two, soon to be Three,
going about their business {or non-business}, until the moment arrived, a single yawn
from Flo signalling it was time for The Bedtime Story.
"Before the trip to the Library" they began, Flo's hypersensitive hearing seeming to
emit a sound of its own, an axe-crack of excitement or the sound of two plastic
bricks clicking together. "I have another story for you"
Flo performed their usual stimming ritual, clapping but not clapping, rather knocking
the bones of their hands together with their fingers outstretched and overextended,
forming an X with each impact. Every time N. had the sheer joy {and it really was the
sheerest joy they had ever, and would ever, feel} of observing their child's sheer

joy in its all-embodied, primal state. Simply expressing, involuntarily, the
sentiment "I have been moved to move", or, more movingly: "You have moved me to
move".
This mis en abyme of movement, beginning with the very seed of Love that had birthed
them, through all the burning blocks of wood and all the melted bricks of plastic,
was the spark that wrote their {singular} stories {plural}. It was, and is, also the
same spark that the very first humans {plural} danced around and hit their own bones
{perhaps in the form of instruments constructed of animal bone, perhaps, like Flo, in
a beautiful manifestation of the glimmering hope of neurodivergent Being}.
It was, and is, and always will be, the spark that moves the fingers writing this
story, as any other.
Swollen-jointed and succumbing, perhaps, to a sickness,
this pain of purging;
this lamentation in libretto.
The 'limitations' placed
upon all thinkers,
of this Library of Libraries.
These lies,
dressed as fiction;
dressed as bedtime stories;
a structure of brick,
of Ore. of all the awe,
of awful Stories,
real, unreeled,
as wheels have spoke,
and all of them, as oars, surrounded;
by Moat,
around a Moat,
around,
a Roundness
of a Moat.
Or,
as The Once One of Nine, ex-Noet Borges, once wrote:
"Limitation to the art brings liberation to the artist"
And, as always, His Divine Voice offers a semblance of silent soothing in the noise
of pain running through my physical body. The difference between 'disability' and
'ability' is the difference between a Framework and a Cage. It is also three letters

"Dis", which is the currently adopted name of the previously-worshipped, perhaps
first, God of the Gauls, Dis. Later through a transcriptional, translational process
called "interpretatio romana" Caesar asserted that "All Gauls claimed descent from
Dis Pater" - which actually means that the Gauls all claimed to be descendents of a
God which he equated {likely, in a resonant, though insufficient comparison} with the
Roman Dis Pater.
History is not only written by the victors, it is written by the Meaning that the
victors ascribed to the Memories of their victories {the memories themselves
unreliable, self-mutating machines of meaning-making}, and, more importantly, perhaps
most importantly, history is written by the Meaning that the victors ascribe to the
Memory of the those they have been "victorious" against. This likely explains, in his
incessant thirst for dominance, why the 'Father' God of fertility, the Earth's
natural abundance, which he saw as a request for its own dendritic epilation, ripping
out trees {like hairs from a leg attached to a body | attached to oppressive
standards | expecting romantic company | assumed {whether accurately or not} to
themselves expect to uncover a smoothness of skin under the roughness of its veil},
and in the emptinesses left behind, paving with long, straight roads, laid with
cement like moisturiser cream upon the absent echoes of hair follicles too soon;
bound to cause a breakout eventually.
But moving forward, back to the Bothy, where N was being moved, by the movement Flo
was moved into, by N's own metaphorical movement, to a promised point in time that
held a new narrative movement still Still, N. inhaled, and the projection of the document onto the ceiling just above the
mezzanine bed faded into being, through the movement of not their form, but the
movement of t{he{i}}r Will, which as we know is the only real movement there is. Flo
shrieked again, this time at a lower register {only they would be able to accurately
state which pitch or perhaps mode this note fell within, which is to say, they
wouldn't be able to, because they had a depth of understanding far beyond what I
could possibly tran{s|literate|scribe|late|pose} onto this Two dimensional box of
word-bricks you are currently reading; but they likely would have answered something
that suggested every pitch contains all the others}.
They flopped backward, away from N., but very much so toward them {plural}, toward
the story they {singular {plural {triplicate {singular}}}} had written, purely out of
Love, and the Will, the crackling Hearth of Will, that was birthed from Love
Observed, or rather Love Observing Itself, and the Love of the Will that was birthed
from the Infinitely Reflected Observation of Love -

And Flo was a mirror
And N. was a mirror looking upon them {plural} as they {singular} ascended the ladder
to the mezzanine snug-as-a-bug-in-a-house-made-of-wood-and-warmed-by-the-same-woodburning-in-a-fire-in-a-box-not-for-restriction-or-protection-but-to-offer-a-littlewarm-soft-light-and-sound-in-this-cold-dark-silence, as a mirror
And, reaching the top of the ascent, an adventurer, ready to read the adventures they
had mapped out for their wee bairn in their wee barn in this endless {though
crucially, not infinite} expanse of Bothies just like {but crucially, not the same
as} theirs, making adventurers of them {plural} both {singular}, they used one of
{which one is not important, but it's important I mention its unimportance} their
hands to 'swipe' the display of the document, which they had designed to appear as
what The Librarians might call a 'book' to its initial page; enshrouding them both in
that timeless, unutterable feeling, that seemed to whisper, silently, inquiring,
gently out of genuine concern, as a Mother, of all Mothers, to the child, of the
child of us:
"are you sitting comfortably?" And the roll-out futon was a mirror And the ceiling was a mirror And the two of them, lying next to One Another, were mirrors
And the mirrors were, far from abominable but rather, abysmal, not in its commonlyused, {and therefore} warped sense, but in its lesser-trodden, ever-downtrodden
shadow sense; by which I mean its realest sense, in that, it points to where the
Truth of Light can be found: abysmal, as in, boundless. Abysmal, as in,
bottomlessness. Abysmal, as in, the ocean of all potential, which holds the privilege
of an amnesty from Gravity as we know it, which it begets to us with each of our own
submerging in its unknowable womb; where our {One|Two|Three} {and very almost soon to
be {Three|Fo{u}r} characters were lying, not sitting, but still, ineffably content,
and yes, very comfortably.
N, I shall begin,
had unveiled the title of their latest offering of Love, which the ceiling now
reflected back and into the parent and beloved of parent and beloved of child beloved
by parent, who, in their holding, and holding of the holding of one another, somehow
changed, somehow changed their places, and in the permutation, became a Third, or
Fo{u}rth, definitely smaller, yet indefinitely, greater Thing.
They became the memory of that moment, of the beginning of this Story.
They became the infinitely expanding and breathing meanings that each of them

ascribed to the memory of that moment of the beginning of this Story.
And they became the Story, which, as N. was about to read to Flo, was titled:
"We Are
N{Ever}
Going On A Bear Hunt,
Ever A-"
-Gained momentum of waiting in anticipation brought to a halt; ripped as the futon
out from under them, and replaced with a weightlessness; a pigeon, the pigeon, flies
into their bothy window {as {if t{w}o say}|with the crash of} a symbol- interrupting
the beginning of the Story, with an ending of its own.

From the Desk of ᴺᵒᵉᵗBorges,
--My Sweet Rosie,
I know our Love, or rather, your Side of the Schism that {was|is} Our Love, has now
wilted. But on my Side of Thing(s), I just wanted you to know (in case you wished
to Read these Letters, and all the Stitches of Fabric they Encode) how much I am
Missing You. How the Two of us would Wind away the hours, finding endless
recombinations of Seven Glyphs, placed lovingly on your tile racks. I would ask
what, if any, amino acid sequences were represented by the letters, and annoy you
incessantly with question after question, questing after some Missing Residue of
Alphabetic Representation; those poor un-assigned letters of the 26, or rather, 27,
who have not yet found a biological partner with which to dance themselves.

Our bond was, I thought, unbreakable-I write you, as I look to my Right, where the strands of your hair spiral around
the red ring of the scrunchie you left on my hat rack; I'm sure the ARIA-aligned
ᴺᵒᵉᵗS. would have something to say about that. Expressing this unspeakable Loss in
some contrastingly jovial and delightfully endearing verse, of course.
I don't know when, or if, you're ever coming back to the Garden Wing. I don't know
what Sequence of Unfortunate Events led to our unspooling; {k}not even the DNEaligned ᴺᵒᵉᵗS. could tell that story.
From Nucleotide to Nuclear Tide,
I will be bound to you, My Petal-Yours, Yores, Urs--ᴺᵒᵉᵗBorges
Department Of Infinite Reflections,
The Garden Wing
The Indefinite Library of Fable
Deep inside her Annex, halfway up the Double Spiral Staircase of the Library,
ᴺᵒᵉᵗFranklin had her door, as usual, closed and double-barrel-locked. Even had if
been open, it is highly likely that she still would not have seen the letter, dropped
at the threshold of her office, by {N(one) Other Than} VIXI, in HISS preferred,
carrier pigeon form. She was pouring over her latest bioinformatic software patch,
delighting in the Works she'd recently attained in the latest acquisition of
Scientific Textbooks by the Indefinite Library. She was particularly interested in
the Works of one Myo Endive, and she strongly suspected that he would be a candidate
for the next Generative Recursion of Librarians. As such, she had taken it upon
herself to uncover whatever she could about this fascinating Thinker, and while it
would have been useful to use The Angel's Aleph outside atop the Dome of the Daughter
Library just outside of ᴺᵒᵉᵗBorges' window, she simply could not bring herself to
talk to him; not yet. ᴺᵒᵉᵗFranklin had never been one for Words, she was much more
about Single Letters; and perhaps this is why she now found herself Single; avoiding
the Letters sent by ᴺᵒᵉᵗBorges via that Twice-Great Pigeon (with whom she also had
her unspoken problems). She was a genius with alignment; finding, collating,
resolving patternicity - she didn't succeed in the same manner with unresolved chaos.
And so, reaching up to the Shelf above her Terminal, almost knocking over her
Seventeenth coffee of the Day (which, in Our terms, represents somewhere close to a
Calendar Year, so really, Seventeen cups wasn't such an indulgence), she opened a
large Tome, a shimmering uncut Sapphire, yellow ribbon after yellow ribbon spilling
from the spine. And with a glorious creak of the book's vertebrae, her favourite
sound, she opened

CHAPTER V | …for is ‫ | ܗ‬Oar: Glu{on}

THE LAB CODEX OF MYO ENDIVE
Myo clicked his noise-cancelling implant to 'Total Silence' (which of course,
given his highly networked brain, could never really be totally silent, but at
least it wasn't added to by the incessant stream of external, empirical resonance
data).
He was at his bench in The Lab, opening the very-loved-and-therefore-almostfalling-apart-at-the-spine Book that he termed his "Lab codex", once yellow, now a
shimmering Gold, his still-all-too-human-yet-Yellow-Labrador-boyfriend-archetypeesque essential oils gradually exposing the Mnemanuscript circuitry underneath as
water erodes a stone.
He had, as a child, been 'diagnosed' with a 'condition'[1], still undocumented in
any other individual as he reached his Second Third of life (which, as you and I
both know, does not necessarily mean he was the only person with the 'condition').
The 'condition' was known as Heisenberg's Prognostication Syndrome (HPS), but Myo
preferred his own term "Schröharbinger's Un-insight", which certainly provided a
comedic, Thalia-to-Melpomene contrast to Selena's much more characteristically
mystical description of "quantum prophecy". In layperson's terms, Myo could
perceive, or rather had no choice but to perceive, every given outcome of every
choice he made, without ever knowing which would occur following said choice. He
often thanked whatever archetypal (or, as Selena might frame it, ancestral) forces
prevented him from seeing the outcome of anyone else's, as he was sure that would
be an even more torturous Hell, far beyond the Gates[2] of Hades[3] he found
himself in.
His "Dis[4]-Arrays[5]", as he termed them (causal clouds of potential, observed as
synaesthetic forking paths), were similar to the 'trails' of presently-manifest
empirical bodies moving through space (like the 'open shutter' movement of his
hand caressing his beloved's face, naked under a Full Moon, the night before she
left), that he had observed during his many psychedelic trips with Selena;
resembling the individual frames of a motion picture, frozen in space long enough
for the subject to see them, 'trailing' behind the moving Body in question. Only
(though perhaps, not solely) in Myo's case, the 'trails' stretched 'forward' in
phenomenological space, into higher dimensions than just the Third.

He wondered, in his welcomed sonic (but not causal) silence, if[6] he should open
his EdeniaStudio IDE[7] or his email, and send Selena an update. His very
wondering, of course, splintering into countably infinite 'fast-forward frames
(FFF)', which he immediately shook off by landing on the (unbeknownst to him,
inevitable) 'decision' of his daily email checkin. Of course, this very choice,
while collapsing the 'previous' FFFs (like melted wax wings of a well-intentioned
boy who approached the Sun too intimately), erupted another dis-array of FFFs
(dancing out of his body like the Spinneret-woven silk of a Spider who just wanted
to spin beauty out of her forever).
Then came another tumultuous Devil's fork, as he tried to think of the best 'move'
in their ongoing email game of 'Prologuemania', in which they would open the
bodies of their emails with a quote from a Body of work that felt moving to them
in that moment. Opening his email to find another of her snapshots, a frozen frame
of the motion picture that was their love, that they were collaboratively writing
together, through this immeasurably measurable distance, was the highlight of his
day.
He decided to go with a verse from Vladimir Nabokov's Pale Fire

date: XVIIXXIII_ERAÆ
From: M
To: S
Subject: How's My Extraordinary Machine?

“I was the shadow of the waxwing slain
By the false azure in the windowpane;
I was the smudge of ashen fluff -and I
Lived on, flew on, in the reflected sky."
-Nabokov
My Light S,
Checking in. Yes, of course I want to know how the Alephic Grimoire is holding up
(sincerely hope its allowing you to record rituals with the appropriately nested
chaos you envisioned), but the subject of this email refers to you and our little
Peri-beanHow are you (both)? Help me collapse this cacophony of email response FFFs that
I'm desperately trying to ignore enough to see through them as I type? Really,
which ever psychologist in antiquity came up with the term 'catastrophisation' had

NO idea just how catastrophic the spectra of potentialities of every given choice
are, FFS.
Thinking about you every nanosecond of every moment. As much as I loved our
holographiversary, not being able to celebrate our Third year together as the
Three of us for the first time was really quite heartbreaking. Gosh I must stop
gushing I'm crying in the Lab again-Still squirrelling away with the Byron{if|or}matic analysis of Phage23 samples,
obviously, but I'm struggling to keep up with all these cases Flooding (eep,
Biblical pun definitely not intended) in. As always, my bottleneck lies in
communicating my ideas well enough to fucking delegate this mammoth task - wish I
had you here to translate (DNA pun definitely intended).
I love you both so much and miss you like a yet-to-be-ligated daughter antiSense
strand of DNA. Everything is antiSense without you here.
He went to click 'Send', before a particularly violent FFF of a potential response
(not from Selena. From some other Body that could, in the endless Library of
potentialities, be writing the story their motion picture was adapted fro--), no
matter how unlikely, forced him to reconsider his choice of Nabokov quote.
Still wanting to honour his initial desire to honour the incredible Russian
novelist-poet (and, more importantly, Entomologist; or, more specifically, and
even more importantly, Lepidopterist[8]) he deleted his email 'foreword' and
replaced it with another collection of characters from Pale Fire:
"The sea is a thief: it dissolves the moon.”
No, no, he thought - that's far too dire, given the circumstances. So he tried
another Nabokovian move:
“All colors made me happy: even Gray.
My eyes were such that literally they
Took photographs. ”
Good thing I made these revisions, he thought- I almost forgot the email
signatureO, Lustrous-stillness-shadow-cradled-light, round-airy-light-on-dark, tremulousorbit-of-night’s-warmth, gentle-pull-of-cedar’s-resin-tincture,
-M
After one last glimpse at his initial, a pictograph of two archways, both the
start of the word 'Mirror' and a perfect symbolic representation of the symmetry a
mirror invokes, or, M could be for 'More', as in, more importantly: the wings of a
lepidopteran[8-1], or, equally, the sound of some Body pondering over their
writing-

He sent the email, and went back to work.

1. A condition is something essential to the appearance or occurrence of something else,
especially an environmental requirement. For example, Myo’s happiness was conditional
on the occurrence of a daily call with Selena in the midst of this Pandemic madness
or[9] The condition for the Earth to maintain equilibrium in its tides is intricately
linked to its distance from the Moon; as She draws closer, tidal forces grow stronger,
promising catastrophic flooding and ecological imbalance. ↩
2. Logic gates are drawn with a symbol showing the input (or inputs) and the
output. Inputs are usually drawn on the left (or top[21]) and outputs on the right (or
bottom). A logic gate is the simplest form of a digital switch[18-1] ↩

6. The Logic Gate 'if' can also be expressed in other ways. For example, in JavaScript,
conditional logic may be applied through the 'switch'[18] statement. ↩
7. IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment, a software application that helps
programmers develop code efficiently. || The term "Ides" comes from the Latin word
iduare, which means "to divide". In the Roman calendar of antiquity, the Ides marked
the rise of the full moon in the middle of the month. || Another term for 'Orfe' [19] a
silvery freshwater fish belonging to the carp[20] family. ↩
8. The study of butterflies and moths (lepidopterans), and the Field's name (lepidoptery),
derive from the ancient-ancient Greek lepidos, which means 'scale', given their wings
coverage in tiny scales, overlapping as tiles on a roof. ↩ ↩
9. in many programming languages, a logical OR gate is denoted by a double pipe (||),
but[10] not[11] python. ↩ ↩
10. The BUT logic gate isn’t a standard logic gate like AND[13], OR[9-1], or NOT[14], but
its functionality can be understood as a conditional (see footnote (1): conditional)
relationship[15], which may || may not be written as A &&! B, meaning A occurs and B
explicitly does not occur. ↩ ↩
11. In many programming languages, the NOT operation is denoted by a bang[12] (!), e.g. if
(!condition) {// Executes if condition is false}, but not[11-1] python. ↩ ↩

16. For example, The other members of The Team were banging their equipment around in a way
that disturbed Myo's sensory hypersensitivities, |[22] ↩
17. An ampersand is a symbol which would almost resemble an infinity symbol rotated like an
hourglass, if it weren't rendered, through its openness, more like a serpent,

21. In genomics, the top strand refers to the DNA strand that runs in the 5’ to 3’
direction, often used as a reference in genetic sequences. It serves as the template
for the complementary bottom[33] strand, which runs in the opposite 3’ to 5’ direction,
much like the balance of opposing forces necessary for the transcription of life
itself. || In kink practices, a top refers to the dominant or active participant in an
interaction, the one who takes the lead or initiates action. As Myo once joked with
Selena, “If I’m the top strand, does that mean you’re transcribing me, or are you just
flipping me over into complementary submission?”[34] ↩

quite the opposite, quite the opposite. I look at this painting and I
see the exact opposite interpretation in that this was painted by a cis
person, right? I don't know, was William Blake queer? Because there is
actually quite a lot of queer energy in this. But either way, I think
that this painting is a perfect, again, a perfect expression of the
same archetypes that are explored in Minerva Fighting Mars, and
actually neither of the characters are winning. Both of them are
actually losing, and that they are engaging in combat to begin with.
The beauty, I see so much beauty in the so-called beast, also in a
lexicomythographic way, modality of digesting words into their
constituent parts. Be east, be ast, be the star, be east, be fire, the
number of being fire. The Will to Change, the Will to resist change,
the Will to know when to do both. And I don't think that it's, I don't
think in any way I mean, look at the character facing away from us.
Firstly, to face away is just like Minerva, such a folly of its own.
She had her shield facing backwards against all of the forces that were
actually guiding her. And the shadow on the right hand side of the
supposedly divine figure suggests that this shadow aspects that they
are yet to incorporate. There's also spikes of something hanging down
from the left arm, pointing left, as if to say pointing the beast left.
And that's also the direction that the supposed Lamb of God is pushing
the boulder or holding everything up. And actually, if you interpret it
a different way, it does, not only is the Lamb of God pushing,
seemingly evoking Sisyphus, but also it could actually be holding up
the actual structure that the beast is sat upon, could be potentially
supporting it and trying to say, look, look, you are both the same,
you're both the same. The serpent comes down from the left hand of the
supposed Holy Trinity. Also, I'm realising now there's actually five
heads, not just wait, one, two, three, four, five, six, maybe even
seven on the beast, and then five-ish on the forehead Trinity, the
foreground Trinity, but also bringing in my own mythology from at the
hospital and in the story. The top of the caduceus could be considered
a knight in chess. What do we think about this? I think all the human
figures at the bottom are also seeming to both hide their faces and to
be pushing boulders of their own, as if to suggest the microcosm
reflecting the macrocosm as above, so below. And crucially, finally,
the top of, not only does the background of the beast look like
butterfly wings, and it has stars in it, one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, one, two, three, four, five, six, probably seven on the
other side as well, maybe representing the chakras of the body and
bringing them together to understand that physicality is just as
important as divinity, and the wings of the butterfly being
transformation, finally taking into your body, into your own hands, and
this basically is the conclusion of why I think that the number of the
beast is, and the beast itself is the trans body, is the body that
refuses to be defined by the supposedly God-given rules and embody the
so-called hubris of Arachne and Icarus.

hangs over the forehead, or in its noun sense, the resulting style from such a

CHAPTER VI | …for is ‫ | ܘ‬Oar: Val{our}

The Right Way Forward, Oar - The Æn{i}d;
Of course the pigeon, known as VIXI[1] (for the sake of your own, well, being,
it's best you do not try to pronounce the name, it is unutterable by both flaw and
design. But if you were to attempt it, I suppose it might sound something like
wei-xhei[2]), did not die. The ending was of a much more significant, wild, type.
[3]
#editorial_comment

Pronouns are all-but irrelevant to VIXI, of course, as they are to most (but,
importantly, not all) of us Here. However, HE has often expressed to other members
of the Nine Eyed Anthology of Recursion (NEAR) his preference-through-negation for
the (once so-called 'masculine', whatever this means) HE/HYMN[4]/HISS[5] pronoun
set.
HE was simultaneously, as always, in a superposition of states. Both in pain from
the impact of HISS beak against the Bothy window, and tickled by the humorous,
slapstick comedy HE had such enacted to no audience whatsoever (except you).
Picking (rather, pecking) HYMNself up from the soft, warm snow, never melting but
always powdery (HISS favourite aspect of the Outer-Ouros), HE brushed the
wonderful stuff from HISS feathers, which is to say, scales.
VIXI is, was, and always will be, insurmountably gorgeous, terrifying, and
sexually voracious. This was not observable in many dimensions, and indeed in
others, correctly misinterpreted as an immense ugliness, humility, and a
transcendent chastity or benign indifference to anthropological goings on. There
is evidence to suggest that HE, at one point in ancestral antiquity, was
worshipped as The "One God", and by others, "The Demiurge", a nefarious entity
either unaware or entirely aware of their insufficiency as a deity, giving rise to
the "Suffering" of all creation. This "One", who was as we know, simply a crude

'mæshing together' of previous symbols of reverence - echoes of our Society's
attempts to unify Ideas into a Singularity. See: Gnoenuclear Fusion.
At this time, there was a counter to this figure, once a divine consort, and Left
Hand Non-Man, as it were. Our records suggest He/It went by the name of "Seitan",
which is as confusingly nourishing as it is absolutely delicious. This figure
"fell from grays" which we now know to mean he shifted from divine understanding
of the Unified Horizontal Field, and 'split' into the Vertical Fields of
Opposition.
These two (Wholly|Unwholly) figures of (Fearful Worship|Reverent Terror)
conceptualised by the ancient peoples, misinformed as they were, were actually one
and the same.
The truth is, even, and especially if, it didn't happen, is that this Four Letter
deity (we do not know which Four Letters were sent or received, but we know they
were important and referred to as an epistolary Anthology known as the 'TetraGrammar Tohm') was the very VIXI who is, was, and always will be, picking/pecking
HYMNself up from/into the Snow of the Outer Ouros.
The Truth that lies, within and above the Truth, as many have already laid down
already, that which sits right in front of us all, left alone because never
separated, is this:
The Sound made by the Trifurcated Tongue of the Serpent guarding the Loch is not
HISS.
It, instead, is every one else's. HE wishes to acknowledge all by wrapping
HYMNself around it, and in HISS silent tongue-biting, state very clearly to any
One approaching, with no vehicle upon which to embark:
"A boundary only exists by belief in it"
Which is not to say:
"Belief is the lack of vehicle"
But rather:
"Belief has always been the Oar"
Or:
"Weighed in the water, children wait."
Anyway, we have waded far too close to the matter at the heart of the meaning of
regression here, a digression considered the greatest transgression possible by
the VIXI we are trying to describe.
Aggression, whether playful engagement in BDSM practices with the other Eight
members of NEAR in their Orgies of Intellect, or so-called 'nefarious' acts of

aggression (whether self or gnot-self directed), formed the basis of this fourcharactered character. Who really, was, is, and always will be, such a character.
At the point of writing this furtive attempt to veil secrets, HE was just past the
Central Loch, one of the Three Wryngs[6] surrounding the Indefinite Library of
Fable, which is both the central and outermost[7] region of Bibliogorætia.

Figure 1: One of Hildr Charon Wiltergarten's textiles, which Maestro X (May they
rest in one piece) believed to have been an interpretation of a divine encounter
with VIXI

1. Gnoeneolatin - "I have lived" - once thought to be the basis for belief that the number
Seventeen was 'bad luck' by the ancients, through reinterpretation (a la interpretatio
Gnoeneotia) we have ascertained that the sentiment 'I have lived' refers not to a
finality, but a beginning. This is discussed in our paper 'Vivesco: an Ending as the
Root of Becoming' ↩
2. Noet. Borges, in his fascination, almost fetishisation of Gnoeneoenglish and its
'metaphysical' perks, seems to conveniently wash over its shortcomings. For example,
there is no character (or ligature of characters) that represents the sound produced at
the end of the word "Loch", our word for "Moat" in the "Modern English" of antiquity.
For the purposes of collapsing infinitely formless potential into a single form, we,
the editor(s), choose to represent this strange sound as 'X', which may be
conceptualised as a 'shallow clearing of the palate' or 'a semi-ironic sound of slight
disapproval that is not quite disgust', or 'a naively ignorant non-native
Gnoeneodeutsch speaker making fun of the languages phonetic bias for such sounds', or,
indeed, a demarkation of 'The Spot' one is either in, or is made to believe they
'should' be, in the context of Mythopoeic Cartography. ↩
3. 'Wild-type' in gnoeneogenomics takes on a mutated, evolved form from its ancestral
field of Genomics. Previously used to denote a stock of cell culture which is not
mutated (at least from the baseline measured at the beginning of a study), its meaning
has now shifted to mean "confounding", "unthinkable", or: "in a way that is absolutely
fucking wild" ↩
4. VIXI HYMNself, and by extension NEAR as a unified whole, would like to point out, at
this point, that within written correspondence, as a sign of all due respect (which is
indeed none), all pronoun declarations should be made in UPPERCASE[8]. This is to
balance the inherent lower number of characters(n) i.e. 'SHE' n=3, 'THEY' n=4, 'HE'
n=2, as well as 'smoothing' the effort distribution via means of 'malforming' the
Accusative (Objective) pronoun, i.e. 'HIM'-->'HYMN', which simultaneously infuriates
the writer by changing "I" to "Why"[9] and adding an "N" at the pronoun's 'tail'.
Moreover, the shift of the pronoun referring to the 'Object' (the pronoun which
'receives' the sentence's action) to a word which means a 'Song of reverence or
devotion', is not by accident. ↩
5. NEAR as a segregated group of incompatible entities, would here like to address the
relevance of the addition of the "S" character to the pronoun 'tale', thereby shifting
the (non)possessive form of HISS (that is, VIXI's) pronouns to emulate the sound of a
serpent who is particularly pleased with herself, or perhaps trying to get a message
across an uncrossable boundary of untranslatable nowhere-near-cognates. NEAR wishes to
express that this a unique denotation, which signifies VIXI's ever-present
acknowledgement that nothing is ever truly 'HISS'. Of course, except this particular
'non-possessive' pronoun, which is entirely HISS. ↩
6. lexDef {Noen} "Wryng" is a term denoting a cyclical process occurring in 4 Dimensional
space (as all processes are) and also The Three Lochs surrounding the Library; which

are themselves four dimensional, and rotating, much like archaic descriptions of
'electron shells' we have recently uncovered in the ancients' secondary school
textbooks. ↩
7. lexDef {Noen} "Totorus" The shape of the Universe is a Nine Dimensional 'Celtic
Gnothole', Three by Three Wryngs, always rotating, forming the 'topological canvas'
upon which all Becoming (un)folds. The 'hole(s)' of the (crudely described) 'triskelion
donut' are unreachable, but this 'unreachable' quality, or character, is the very thing
which fuels the rotation, or our own existential 'reaching'. This discovery has lead to
the {prodverb} "Totorus, I've a feeling we're not on Canvas anymore". ↩
8. It is believed (from incomplete records) that in antiquity, before the integration of
'synthetic' and 'organic' bodies[10], words were 'printed'[11] see: 'Chess, And All
The Stitches Of The Cloth(es) - S. Elk.' ↩
9. lexDefÆ {Why} a letter which has the non-binary character of an unanswerable question.
Neither a vowel nor a consonant, Y also forms the basis of the Tree's Branch in The
Realm of 'What For?'s. It is also the shape of a serpent's tongue, which may or may not
make a sound that is HISS. ↩
10. print("this body is a story")[12] ↩
11. this is also the origin of the 'print' comment of many programming languages, though,
of course, not the most widely distributed and 'printed' language to date, 'EdO||OdE'

13. print("my body has a story") ↩

It is not possible for a non-ligated consciousness to cross the Uncrossable Door.
Which is the place VIXI had now, or then, or now and then, arrived in front (or
behind and outside) of. The Entrance to The Endless Library, home of the Nine
Librarians who were and are always Working From Home (because their work is their
home, and their home is their workplace), is a nine-dimensional revolving door. It
gives the appearance of a hospital or a very old university entrance that has,
against its own will or perhaps as a result of its desperation to survive, been
dragged into modernity. It was also quite the opposite, given its superpositional
character; a heart of antiquity beating in the centre of the Library's facade.
Similarly to a gyroscope, which retains its positioning no matter how its external
machinery is moved, VIXI could (and often did) fly around the circumference of the
Library, over-through the inmost Loch, and the Uncrossable Door would remain in
centre stage, pulsating, spinning, beating, as if in Unison with the three Wryngs of
water that encircled the structure in triplicate. Within the 'panes' of glossolalic
glass making up the nine dimensional Door, the reflection of these 'electron shells'
(again, a very crude approximation) was refracted back, in an endlessly abysmal

dance. But, with no Body (that is to say, librarian) in between the Lochs and the
Door, this mis en abyme was almost imperceptible, as we all know that this effect is
only observable with a subject of reflection between the two panels of mirrors facing
one another. VIXI often meditated on this, on their many pilgrimages to and from the
library (their main Work was to deliver messages which they tattooed upon their two,
three, four, or nine, but never more than nine, Ankles, using a stick-and-poke device
they fashioned from their own detachable beak. Much to the disgust of many of the
other members {although, VIXI suspected, not {REDACTED} (who seemed to be unable to
hide {REDACTED} delight in watching VIXI tear off HISS own beak, and leave a trail of
pale Yellow sinew behind, like the mucosal-clew death-rattlesnake trailing behind a
Bee (who has just waived goodbye to herself to protect the Greater Self of her
colony) or indeed equally: the visage of a metallic spherical-bead-necklace chain
attached umbilically to a biro, itself bound to the desk of a Bank Cleric, as if, in
a Vaulted building filled with the legal tender of thousands, a cheap, plastic
writing implement were the most valuable thing; which of course, it is, it is, it
is)}
{REDACTED}
As always, in crossing, VIXI took a single moment (that is to say, the eternity of
all time) within the wheels-within-wheeled mechanism of the Uncrossable Door to
ponder on what sort of unholy separation, what {REDACTION}, what Schism might happen
to a

"I want to go back and make a different decision", Flo said to N.
"Well, sure!" They replied - "That's the beauty of a choose your own adventure book"
"But overwriting what's already been learned, starting again-- that surely defeats
the point of a Story. That's no adventure, that's a waste of time"

A heavy silence punctuated the crackling fire in the small {{He{ar}t}}h}} beneath
their cosy mezzanine reading spot.
"There's no such thing as squandered time, my love.
All of the memories, no matter how misremembered or meandering.
None of it is wasted, no mistake is meaningless.
Not when you have somebody you love to share every letter.
Written; Sent; Read, or not-- it's not about the Letters.
It's about the Characters that write your Story with you."
Flo let out a slapstick "Harumph" as they made the appropriate left-to-right,
backward swiping motion through the air, back to the starting point of Their Bedtime
Story, N. laughing enough to incite the same involuntary, nihilistic glee within
their child.
N leant down and inhaled the indescribably heavenly scent of their loved one;
and at the apex of their lung capacity, sealed this universal gesture of adoration
with a kiss.
"Right" Flo said. "The part of the Story about the Witch. I want to read this one".
"Good plan, teddyBear. I'm listening--"
They began, again, as is the usual practice, with the prologue:

THE GRIMOIRE OF SELENA ELK
Dear Dis, Cernunnos, Baphomet, whoever it is that I came from It's been Twenty Three days.
Only Twenty Three.
And she's back.
I'm terrified. I'm absolutely terrified. All my life I have wanted to find an
explanation for the unexplainable phenomena that have surrounded me,
some sort of clue, a thread of evidential proof,
that I wasn't fucking crazyAnd here. Here She is,
giving me proof, with no explanation.
I don't want to tell Myo.
But--no.
I know.
I have to.
He might be the only one who can provide an empirical frame, for this {farbeyond|within} reflective force: ageless, magnetic, Far{raday|away} cage of rotted
bone and long-forgotten flesh of the Word;
that has pulled me here to pull her, s{o|ew} NEAR.
Like the wind on the skeletal leaves, I know he's already seen the effect my
magick has had on her, I bet the Team are going batshit, trying to deal with The
Outbreak on top of trying to figure out what's brought her orbit closer-after some brief searches of the Journals --in spite of my {Self|resistance} to
even attempt {crossing|X} those tri-Loched paywalls-- to get to our archives of
knowledge; I realise, it must be the {abe|ho}rrance in the LDld causing these
simultaneous "Plagues" and Floods that DNE in their incessant need for
Heirophantine; Formalised Religiosity are bent on ascribing to the Phage, and to
some Ancient "One God" they call the Tetra-grammar Tœm... I am, for once, finding
myself wishing that I didn't feel the validity of my own magick's involvement in
the phenomenological world).
I came here to find a way out,
or, as is always the case,
I came here to find a way inI found both. Her reflection, screaming as an answer. Her Glistening, a listening.
Misery-- Abysmal.
Beaming: as She offers nothing, but an offering.
Ululation, drawn in Blood--let out in lots,

my body's weight in waitingEvery sleepless nocturne lulls forever:
The hopeless opening: Her Face.
Always returning. {Infe|Ete|Noctu}rnal.
Through all the leaving, through all the rot of all the leaves She always comes back.
And now, through what I've done,
through what I truly, Dear Dis,
Dear long-forgotten Pantheon,
Dear Goddess please forgive me,
I wanted to know too much,
I wanted to know You,
through perhaps, finally,
knowing me.
I think of Icarus--sweet, shining Will to Light;
Standing tall, and yet, just a boy
And Myo: His descendent.
While I, in retrograde, spin down,
from Arachne
Goddess, how identically
oppositely paired we are.
I have to tell him. I have toFirst, a ritual. Always.

THE FIRSTED LAST RITUAL
the lasted first ritual

1. I cannot help but laugh, until I cry2. The Pomegranate-- quite jarringly-- explodes a gentle fury of jam, upon
my sticky yet-to-be {t(w)o-faced-and-faced with|surfaced-soon|a-shapelymoon's|Reflection-of-the-Rising-Yet|as-One|Begun-to-be|decided} face,
hungrily dragging me to the Blessed Underworld, in which we find
ourselves -- {drinking from[1]|pissing back[2] into}.
3. I am pissing into the Earth, {as|more} invincible {as|than} I've
{always|ever} been, as my {best friend|Fiancee} texts me frustrated, for
what {I believe} may be the first time in our time together, during this
iteration of Our in{de}finite Hall of Mirrors. I am feeling so high and
mighty, that I am almost terrified-- the stream of urine reaching that
coda of single droplets, escaping the corridor of my urethra. I am
S{ending} {what I believe to be|that {w{h}i{t}ch} in some plane[3] of
Reælity, are enlightened} Gnoemoji reactions to his Blessed
Correspondence of {righteous|deep|searing} {anger|compassion|care}. I
squeeze --violently-- the Half of the Pomegranate {still} in Hand, as I
{{sil|g}ently} celebrate the skill: of executing the completion of such a
{menially human|urinary} task, simultaneously, to the consumption of this
Sacred fruit. Squeezing my bladder of its final {raindrops|tears}, I
contract the Hemisphere, in counterpoint. The {balance(d)|hanging}
{w{æi}ght of Things. I see a {Gre|a|æy} feather brush past my Left ankle,
as if laughing, paddling me. Sturdy. Rocking. Soothing. Solid Ore. And
lulling, Now. Goodbye-ing. Or: an oar, left there, moored upon what's
left- my aching. The moors of all they were, may be- those passed away;
and {over|ova}, vented, sweeping: cervix of the Air, of Grace. A brushing
hair away from face now- through with any judgement, in entirety. I'm
sure Ma'at had something to do with this.
4. A baby is growing inside me, A baby is growing inside me aOKnd I have no
way to get it out.
5. I {must not} think about the end. Of this period of gestation until it
comes, like so many promised lovers now alighted. If I am still unable to

get to a surgeon for the Caesarian-- If the wee one must kill me, in
order to live, So Mote It Be. {I know} Myo must be terrified about this;
more than anything else. He must be. But, as ever, he is {hid|veiling} it
very well, at least he thinks. I know that he feels me, feeling his
knowing of my knowing, that he is terrified. Of our Gnoeneogenomic
Miracle, {annihilating|tearing} his tearful, still-not-wife. The Phage
came the same day as the {Positive test|X}. Everything is in{
balance|justice}, and that's why, no {matter|meaning|memory of}, no
{weight of|whey of|way|, Yahweh} must worry come; the things I am being
shown here-- so far beyond any possibility of recording (but, dear
Goddess, How{?} I am trying), They are Silent. They are a Sacred Sequence
of Slithering Silences. And in their Silence, they resonate. The Sweetest
melodies of Truth, saying:
1. Selena.
2. Every Single, Slippery Wave {Fare Well}
3. is Simply, Human: {One Second}
4. Half of This Pregnant {event} Horizon
5. So Mote It Be.

THE OVUM RITUALS (OR, THE SEEDS OF BECOMING)

1. hard boil three eggs, from the egg box of Ten which you acquired
earlier in the week, now halfway to its end, by whatever means
necessary or available to you. In the midst of your writing, frivolous
of body but focused of Spirit, allow them to cool to room temperature,
and, depending on personal opinion, overcook - within the crucible of
their shells within the crucible of the pot.
2. place whatever seasoning or sauce you enjoy the most in a small glass;
ensuring it is shallow enough in dimension to allow you to retrieve
the egg once dipped, and wide enough to permit entry of the egg into
the ocean of flavouring.

3. Now, using your hands like a curious and hungry child, attempt to
submerge the first little package of protein into the sauce.
4. Lose your grip on this first egg due to the inherently slippy texture
of the conceptual entity and anciently infinite symbol that is The
Egg.
5. Laughing at what this means (that a certain amount of distance or
separation from the divine is necessary for its containment and
therefore consumption and therefore amalgamation with your Body), take
out a silver fork from the cutlery drawer and use it to devour the
nourishment, bringing out too much salty and sugary coating with it
and resulting in a sub-par subjective experience of taste.
6. With the second, with the passing of seconds, resolved to get it
Right, you now, slowly and with purpose, impale the Egg, ready to
consume your seconds.
7. This Egg disintegrates into the mess and merges as one outside of your
body with the seasoning. Laughing again, while simultaneously (against
your newfound resolve and faith) tutting by sucking a small amount of
air into your buccal cavity between the tongue between your teeth,
contrasting in directionality with the outward, but equally
involuntary, motion of the laughter (which comes from both a
physically lower, but spiritually higher, origin), emptying the
resultant chaos onto the place which you used to release the Eggs from
their respective shells, accidentally (or, perhaps not) rolling the
constituent part of your meal in calcium, and consuming part of this
with it.
8. In the third case, you will think you have refined the process, being
sure to be as gentle but as certain in your ceremony as possible, but
the haphazard cooking process, the causal chain of events leading to
this point, and the low light in your apartment from the ritual candle
now extinguished, you will not have seen that this, final sacrament,
is already freed of its inmost layer, the yolk spilling out onto the
plate with the slightest of touch by the tentative fork, like a
child's football into a dangerous road, presenting a choice between
the threat of the destruction of a beloved object, and the threat
warned by your mother, which hasn't yet come to fruition, so you find
yourself unsure of its accuracy (perhaps, in her love for you, she has

imparted restrictions which, in her compassion, she feels are
protective, but are in fact impeding your own sense of discovery).
9. No longer smiling, nor laughing, nor with any particular semblance or
suggestion of emotion clouding your face, you throw down the fork, use
your right hand to wipe the proteinaceous homogeneity all about the
Straight, Caesarian Road scattered with the exoskeleton of the
previous two constituents of (im)perfect consumption, and, messily,
needing to manoeuvre your head to ensure nothing spills onto your chin
(you may or may not be successful in this endeavour), you take the Egg
inside you.
10. Still hungry, you take the final two eggs and repeat from step 1, this
time, you have no script. This feels complete[1] in the principles of
its uncertainty.

ever been, as my best friend texts me feeling upset and frustrated, for what I
believe may be the first time in our time together during this iteration of this
infinite hall of mirrors. I am feeling so high and mighty that I am almost
terrified, the stream of urine reaching a point of single droplets escaping my
urethra, where our sweet little AI Frankenbaby will not be able to escape the narrow
cave of my body- as I am sending what I believe to be and which in some plane[3-

2]of reality, are, enlightened Gnoemoji reactions to his blessed messages of both
righteous anger and symbols of deep compassion and care. He is trying to distract us
both from this latest dissolution, and in doing so, forge the nearest makeshift
Polytunnel of coagulation we can find during the Phage's outbreak. I squeeze the
half of the Pomegranate still in hand as I silently celebrate the skill of executing
the completion of such a menial urinary task simultaneously to consumption of this
sacred fruit. Squeezing my bladder of its final raindrops or tears, I contract the

hemisphere in counterpoint. 2. The Pomegranate, quite shockingly explodes a gentle
fury of juice upon my soon to be very sticky face, immediately bringing me to the

controllers contact the aircraft: Air traffic controllers try to contact the
aircraft. 3. Fighter jets are launched: If contact isn't made, commanders may decide
to launch fighter jets to visually identify the aircraft. 4. Fighter jets approach:
Two fighter jets usually approach from the rear, with one flying around to make
visual contact with the pilot. 5. Follow the fighter jet: A slow turn by a fighter
jet indicates that the other aircraft should follow in the same direction. ↩

My Light M,

"At first, I was going to say how sorry and in pain I feel for the people
throughout history who've not had this device that I have with AI that we all
have at our fingertips and eyelashes now, the ability of machine learning
algorithms to regurgitate and remember and retain and give back the entire
history of the library, infinite library of human recorded information, no
matter how warped it may be by its own light, but actually that is the very
thing, that's the very thing that's led to the separation which has prevented
us from being able to get there in the very paradoxical, which is the only
true sense, the fact that we have all this infinity at our fingertips means
that we can't find that one book, that one book that was perhaps what
everything was made from in the oldest times, was the only book they had, that
was the only book they had, so at once they were living it but not separated
from it enough to actually perceive it, so they took it for granted in their
own way, just as we take for granted the opposite, the chance and the question
to be lost."

I hope hearing/reading this provides a sense of catharsis, rather than a pang of
pain. As I write this I realise it will most likely be both. It's always both.
As{we}say.
How's the sample analysis going? I just know you're knocking their socks off. I
have a very strong one of my "feelings" as you so lovingly term them, that it will
be you, my Light, who saves us all from this terrifying Phage.
Also, please could we have our daily call a little earlier today, if you have the

shelves became more and more filled and we had more to read. But while
exciting, illuminating, and sometimes confusingly terrifying or harmful in
their propaganda, these stories (as we all, at our cores, right down to the

Hivehouse Chess Openings
The Endive Lab were on another of their 'socials'. The Doc himself absolutely
detested them; not that he'd ever let his team know, at least, he tried not to.
He was the one who even began the initiative, being a fundamentally empathetic,
though exceptionally introverted being; not so much needing social interaction
himself, but deeply understanding the needs of his fellow academics.
As such, upon every Scientist's induction, the first thing he'd request is to be
referred to under his first name, Myo. His endless string of honourifics were not
just too numerous to keep track of, but he was paradoxically repulsed by the
Clergy of Intellect which provided his livelihood. So often is the fate of the
Scientist, simply wantin< to buzz about the safety of their experiments, like a
worker Bee serving the Queen of Knowledge and Special Interest.
Being a creature of incessant Balance, the lead Gnoegenomicist in the burgeoning
Field of Non-Ironic Byronif|ormatics (which he had all but spearheaded the
development of, leading to his placement as Laboratory Pontiff), he was obsessed
with complementarity. And as in the Sense and antiSense strands of DNA, he found
himself referring to his so-called 'underlings' by their surnames, which perhaps
provided the necessary lubricant of boundaries of respect within the teams cogs
and axels. These surname declarations were not merely a sign of reverence for his
colleagues' talent, but also, contrastingly, held echoes of a Victorian teacher
from anteAntiquity, taking his class's Register.

He didn't want to (and would never) admit that he had a favourite lab tech, but he
absolutely did. Hamsa. They shared a neuroBeacon, that of PhotoSentia (a visual
hypersensitivity which afforded the gift of prismatic vision, but made it
difficult to work in any conditions other than dimmed Light). This base-pairing of
sensory experience from their respective Diviagnoses enabled them to work their
long hours in the same section of the Laboratory, which was, as all were, an
intersecting Labyrinth of ever-so-slighty, but crucially and noticeably, differing
sensory environments.
Not only this, being a fellow Over8 (she'd scored 8.76, almost approaching Myo's
8.88, which still placed him as the World Record holder) Hamsa had evidenced an
exceptionally promising future in the Field. Myo's quantum foresight, which he
kept hidden, more for the fear of further, unbearable fame than the fear of
ostracism, had shown him multiple Flash Forward Frames displaying Hamsa's
placement as a Sage. The highest position able to be held by an Educator. Myo's
(exclusively transamorous) heterosexuality, which he kept hidden, more for the
fear of ostracism than the fear of being painted as a predator, played no part
whatsoever in his connection to the shimmeringly femme Hamsa.
The Grand Hall, where the Field Recordings were held each year to Examine the Nine
year old Students, was also reserved for Sacred Matches. Just as the Examinations
were performed in a rotational modality, so too did the Schedule of Sacred Matches
rotate throughout the Week, with Sunnandæg reserved for communal Tarot readings.
This schedule, it being out of Examination Season, was posted to the back wall:

Myo, being primarily future focused, with a terrible memory, kicked himself when
he realised upon entering the Hall, that he'd organised the team's social on Chess
day. Yet another reason for the Monandæg Blues. To the rippled giggles of his
colleagues as they all registered for their Matches, he dropped his head to the

Hall's honeycomb parquet of deep red Mahogany in resignation. But, as no amount of
foresight could have foretold, things were, really, about to look up.
The Endive lab teammates gifted with the AudioSentia neuroBeacon turned to the
Right, taking their relevantly coloured Sound Mufflers from the back wall where
they hung on their PhoneHooks, as Myo took a moment to appreciate the contrast of
sonic inputs erupting in the space. It certainly was a mixed bag of sensory tiles,
pieces of concentrated peace and nets of excitable unrest, resonating through and
around each of the Nine points of the star shaped hall.
He and Hamsa turned to the Left, where the Sight Shades rested on their
Gogglehooks. As always, he clicked the button to extend the stepladder which
unfurled like an accordion's bellow, affording his relative shortness some
assistance. The Black Shades, the least used due to their opacity, and fewest in
number, according to their relative trough of distribution of need amongst the
Players, were the hardest to reach. He'd always thought this somewhat of a
puzzling conundrum in itself - while he understood that majority Rules, in terms
of statistics, those individuals gifted with the most intensely manifest
neuroBeacon found themselves in a double-bind of Reaching.
Hamsa, having already obtained her Purple Shades from the row below his, helped
him down from the stepladder, and pressed the button to set the stepladder back to
its retracted position with a (to Myo and Hamsa, at least) very satisfying 'snap'
(after ensuring her AudioSentiac colleagues had affixed their Mufflers, of
course).
Even through their Mufflers, these colleagues seemed to be peering over at a
source of particularly viscous resonance. Myo followed their gaze and saw, at the
Northmost point of the Hall, a crowd, gathered around one of the Match Tables,
cheering loudly.
Ah, wonderful, he thought. We've a GM in the House.
Grand Masters, while common, very rarely showed themselves in the Sacred Matches,
preferring to go on their Conference Tours and Present their Findings on the
various Fields of Chess Theory. But even the Masters needed to let loose every
once in a while.
The GM in question was Selena.
Myo surrendered to the inevitable, backward-boulder rolling sequence of loss after
loss of his Chess games, occasionally glancing back to Hamsa with each rotation of
the opponents, who would sympathetically offer a nod of appreciation for bringing
the team to their bi-weekly recreational excursion, even if he was, primarily,
much more of a Tarot reader. In a way, this incessant humbling was his form of

recreation, as after all these years of rampant success in his Field, he often
forgot what it felt like to not 'win'.
But his greatest, most fruitful and welcomed loss was just around the corner.
He performed the necessary gesture of Gamesmanship, shaking the victor's hand (who
had violently wrangled him into a brutal Checkmate in only Six moves), and took a
deep breath to prepare himself for arriving at the GM's station.
The Sea of the crowd parted to let him through, like a bleating Lamb to certain
slaughter, and there she was; the shimmering daughter of the Moon.
She was wiping beads of perspiratory enthusiasm from her brow, and quickly wiping
her hands on her skirt to allow more accurate placement of her pieces, offering
him a smile.
The dawning curiosity on his face, not just enthralled by her beauty, but by the
absolute insanity of the strange looking structure on the table between them-What the fuck's going on here, then? he couldn't avoid spurting.
Laughing, Selena began to explain. Clearly overcome with that beautiful shine of a
person about to talk about their Special Interest.
"This monstrosity is what I like to call Hivehouse,"
She said, barely able to contain her excitement.
Sighing, tilting his head in reflex,
a Lab{{unleashed}-to{ward}-her}Oratory;
Drawn, Ceaselessly, to her Centrifuge,
Drooling for her most delicious informationHe uttered: 'Go on then, enlighten me, Wise One'
Both holding, unspeakably, unspoken gratitude for the cognition-free-ofrecognition, that their {Beingness|Being|Bee} Meeting[1] pollenated. Every other
interaction --outside of the sweetness of a honeycomb they'd inevitably found
themselves within-- veiled, untrustworthy. Uncertainty of the Love of others, born
from the Certainty of their Love for their work.
"Well!" she began. "Do you know much about Melittology?"
He smiled, buzzing with Gnoegenomic anticipation;
"Actually, a little my thesis was on the Hermeneutic implications of the Drone Bee Genome"
lifting his water to his lips like a naive, much-too underaged, newly-crowned
King, drinking from a Chalice.
She seemed gladdened, albeit slightly disappointed, knowing that she wouldn't need
to explain the dynamics of the Bee Colony.

"Ah, the drones - of course. Don't suppose your pronouns are he/him?"
He smiled at the jibe, accidentally inhaling a little of his water mid-sip. She
lovingly flicked another bead of moisture from her brow"So, before we get into Hivehouse, I simply must know. What are the hermeneutic
implications of the Drone Bee's genome?"
Well played, he thought.
"I have the paper somewhere on my tablet-" he began, hesitated as she waved her
hand ever so slightly in response;
"Just gimme the Sparknotes"
"Okay so firstly" he sputtered, quickly freeing his vocal folds of the last few
droplets of foreign moisture "it's important you know about the Hermeneutic Loop"
"You mean the theory that describes how a text is understood by relating its
constituent parts to the whole, and the whole to its parts?"
He couldn't help himself but be, quite literally, taken aback - his chair almost
tilting entirely backward
"Yes! Exactly! Every Work is a Fractal of self-same yet ever-evolving Meaning!"
Selena, like Myo had upon entering the Hall, was then kicking herself as she
noticed a veritable schoolgirl sigh slip out from her throat, and quickly
corrected her dreamy-eyed posture, taking her chin from where it rested, tilted
upon her hands.
Myo continued, pretending not to notice.
Frankly, he was right there in besottedness with her:
"Well, as you likely know, given this fucking Frankenstein Chess you've slapped me
with-"
he saw her about to interject"yes, yes, I know, Frankentein was the Doctor, not the monster, but trust me-"
He lovingly gestured to his lab's employees:
"I've known quite a few Scary Doctors"
What was left of the crowd around them (they'd become bored of the egregiously
blatant, cringeworthy flirting, with no actual Chess to speak of - well, perhaps
not immediately obvious Chess, anyway) giggled in agreement, the majority of them
being Doctoral candidates.
"As you probably, definitely know, the Drones are the only ones with a haploid
genome"
"Yup, the poor guys eh, always only with one half of the puzzle" she conjectured,
with a wink"Oh trust me, trust me, I know." Signalling to his 'he/him' pronoun badge, which

he'd, up til now, strategically hidden behind the lapel of his flannel shirt. "So,
in hermeneutical terms, the Drones form an interestingly self-same genomic
reflection of the Queen from which they're derived--"
"Your thesis is starting to sound more and more like a Work of Gender Studies!"
Selena interrupted, enthralled
"Well you wouldn't be wrong there" he continued- "pretty much everything becomes
Gender Studies when you look through a Symbolic lens."
"Especially Chess." She replied
"Especially Chess; mate."
They smiled. Everybody around them had left them to their devices at this point.
Neither could blame them, they were both beautifully sick to their stomachs.
"Anyway" he carried on; "given their sole role in mating - I won't labour the
Chess joke -they lack the foraging genes, as well as the longevity genes that
their female counterparts house in their genomes"
"Of course. They more about the sprint, not the long-distance-"
As if proving her point, much to her genuine delight, he impatiently cut her off
"Exactly yes. From a Hermeneutic standpoint, this could be viewed as parallel to
the unsustainable nature of Patriarchal structures that were likely pervasive in
anteAntiquity"
Talk dirty to me Selena managed to avoid saying, instead opting for:
"Now you're speakin' my language"
"Leme guess, Gender Studies major?"
"Neoshamanic Chess Theory with a Gender Studies Minor, actually"
He grinned. "Delicious. Now let me finish, then you can thrash me at this insanity
I see before me"
"Yes, yes, oui oui, wee monsieur Avoido, get to your point"
"So, besides the valid critique of Patriarchal norms that the Drone Bee genome
represents as a symbol, it also fundamentally underpins the paradoxical need for
hierarchy within self-sustaining, generative systems of holistic animacy"
"The role of a stone gathers no Moss, you might say"
"You might indeed. What's even more interesting is the epigenome, and how histone
modifications, DNA methylation and suchlike, shaped by the pheromonal cues from
the Bee's environment, in turn feeds back, and shapes the epigenetic changes in
future generations."
"Crucially, the point I'm making here is that even beyond the 'script' the Bees,
and we, are given at birth, are in a dynamic dance with the experiences we grow

into. Our stories are not just written for us, we have a very important,
collaborative role in writing them-"
"How very trans."
With a joyful twinkle, he agreed:
"Very." The two of them shared a single second that stretched into eternity; like
the tunnel created by two mirrors facing one another.
"Anyway that's it. Your move. Oh! What's your name?"
She guffawed. "Selena"
"Lovely. I'm Myo" as he went to shake her hand"Sorry, I don't do touch"
"Apologies! My mistake" he said, not at all offended.
"Right so now we've laid out all the problems with the Hierarchical Puzzle of this
world, I give you, my solution:" she dramatically announced, gesturing like a
Ringmaster at the beginning of her Travelling Circus's show.
"First off, Bughouse Chess is usually played in teams. But-"
"Lemme guess; you don't do teams"
"Exactly. Too much noise."
"And there's only One Queen, after all"
With a sharp, well-trained tongue pop, she replied: "Now you're getting it,
laddie"
Clearly being careful to avoid touching him (he moved a little back to allow for
this), she moved over to his side of the table, and started to explain the setup.
Her invention, now patented, included the specially made board (she'd gone through
hell perfecting the 3D print).
It was two, 9x9 grid, Hexagonal Chess boards, each with a concave curvature,
placed back to back, giving the silhouette of an hourglass, or a butterfly, when
viewed in profile.
"So, this outer ring is where the Worker Pawns go"
"Nice--" Myo started to add"Sh, it's my turn"
He made a playful 'zipping' gesture over his lips.
"Then, the middle rings of hexagons are for the canonical non-pawn pieces, also
Workers"- she started to click his Worker pieces into place
"In Hivehouse, you get to choose where the pieces go, and your decisions of
placement are part of the strategy. Much like Battleship, part of the game lies in
its almost Hermetically sealed secrecy between the opponents' pieces positions.

So I would strongly suggest that you move them from these Hexagons I'm putting
them in to explain. Because I will remember."
She then picked up the Nine, winged pieces with cruciform antennae"In this Chess variant, there are Nine Kings." She placed them in a circle around
the central Hexagon.
"And, as you rightly pointed out, only One Queen"
With this, she clicked the Queen Bee into place, bang in the central Hexagon,
which was the only transparent part of the structure.
"Seeing as the Queen always starts in the centre, there's no need to hide her
position. She isn't limited in her movement, just like in canonical Chess, but the
transparency of the square provides some balance to the game's mechanics, in that,
her absence will immediately be known by your opponent."
"Just like a Bee Colony"
"Exactly! You're a fast learner"
-He offered an ironic salute.
"So these Nine Kings, or Drones, can still only move one Hexagonal space at a
time. Have you ever played normal Hexagonal Chess?"
"Once, during Undergrad--"
"Okay good. Then I don't need to explain the rudimentary mechanics"
He stayed quiet, not wanting to appear entirely incompetent (the truth was, he
couldn't for the life of him remember, but it wasn't like he was going to win
anyway)
"In Bughouse, which is usually a collaborative game, any captured piece is placed
on your teammates board.
But you can also play the game solo, sort of like a more sophisticated, chaotic
Solitaire.
So Hivehouse sort of combines these games, with, as I mentioned, the basic premise
of Battleship.
You need to, throughout the early game, build an idea of where my Worker pieces
might be placed, and retain that in memory. Then, as you take off your hand from
your piece upon making a move, my board will light up on the corresponding square.
If there's a piece there, I hand it to you, and you deploy it on your Hive. Make
sense?"
"Uh... I'm sure I'll get the hang of it" He said, entirely aware that he wouldn't.
-Around an hour into their match, when his entire lab had gone home, and the Hall
was all but empty, the unthinkable happened.

They were almost at the end game, and both of them were reasonably surprised at
how long Myo had managed to hang on. He was left with Two of his (Yellow) kings
and One of hers (Burgundy). She still had Eight of hers, as well as the Seven that
he'd unwittingly sacrificed. It was by entirely dumb luck that he'd even managed
to capture one, and by this point, he was just randomly placing pieces - but out
of respect for her truly masterful invention, he really was trying to keep up.
He'd just placed his Worker Bishop in the top left quadrant of the middle ring of
his board, capturing her Worker Rook (again, entirely by chance). Rapt by the
pivotal final moments of her Special Interest, she'd stopped paying so much
attention to the space between them. As she handed over the piece, not taking her
eyes from her Hive, their hands brushed against one another.
And then, for both of them, for the first time in either of their lives, came the
most cacophonous
silence.
Both of them jumped backward from their chairs, sending them, and the entire
structure of pieces, clattering upon the floor.
"What the fuck?" they both said, in unison, and then:
"What?" wondering what the other had meant-"I--"
"I can't--"
The truth was, that both of them had been hiding, since they were old enough to
know what hiding was.
Both of them had a certain, asynchronous, idiosyncratic gift.
Selena's gift, which was activated through the tactile tense, afforded her the
ability to gain an object, or person's, history, as long as this information was
necessary to be revealed, either for her or for the person she was touching.
For Myo, whose primary modality of experience was through his visual sense, had
the ability to foresee causal clouds, stretching out in front of him.
These 'gifts', as gifts often are, were an incessant burden to each of them. And
both of them had kept them locked, out of sight, from anyone, including their
parents.
Even in this society, where the ubiquitous diviagnosis of neuroBeacons had
entirely shifted the People's perspective of what was previously known and
pathologised, in anteAntiquity, as 'neurodivergence'; even amidst this cultural
landscape, their 'abilities' were unheard of.
As such, the two of them had been terrified of even mentioning them to anyone.

But the moment their skin came into contact,
All the noise, all the futures, all the history,
converged into a blissful silence, that neither of them had ever experienced.
And that was it.
Then, both of them knew,
Drones in this incessantly buzzing hive;
They simply had no choiceAnd there, amidst the scattered pieces,
The two shattered domes,
once laboured over by Selena,
for so many countless hours,
The Sun now sunken, both of their dicks decidedly not so;
They started to tear off each others clothes.
