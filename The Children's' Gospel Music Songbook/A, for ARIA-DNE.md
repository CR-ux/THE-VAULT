*"Mirrors and copulation are abominable, because they in-crease the numbers of men"*

At the beginning of our story which is historically not fiction, our character, who for now, which is never, or for better which is worse, we shall simply call "N"[^N], was or is, or will be finalising his scientific paper on Borges' short story _Tlon, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius_. As those cursed enough or indeed gifted enough (as both are one and the same) to have been tasked or to have tasked themselves with the writing of such a tome will know, or have known, the proper treatment[^T] requires one to be entirely consumed by the work, so that eventually, or perhaps causally, the subject matter seeps into all aspects of their life, waking or not.
N lived in a place called Tohms, filled, and ever-densifying with, a teeming landscape of islands within islands[^infinity], and an equally ever-densifying landscape of tourism - the economic influx of which provided most of the City's income. Tohms' population was at a particularly bitter peak[^Peak][^Pe] in its schism[^schism] - splitting the people into two in/out groups[^IO], or two out/in groups see IO: [[Remember]] (2028): those who welcome, almost worship change (of the restricted chain[^Ch] of evolution), and those who resist it, clinging to what ancestral truth once was, but tragically, needed to die (the connecting chains[^Ch] of the past). 
He believed he had just finalised what seemed to be the hundred-and-eighth revision of his abstract (which was in fact the twenty-third[^sample]):

**Title**: _Language, Ontology, and the Fabrication of Findings in Tlon, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius_
Abstract: Borges’s _Tlon, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius_ offers a profound exploration of language as both a tool of perception and an instrument of creation, positing a constructed world in which linguistic structures fundamentally shape ontological realities. In _Tlon_, linguistic and cultural {REDACTED} invented languages within Tlon, whose noun- and verb-centric structures reflect alternate forms of consciousness, each perpetuating a different kind of worldview (Borges, 1940). Within _Tlon_, linguistic and cultural schisms create divergent ontologies, illustrating synecdoche as a principle wherein each part of {REDACTED} populations. This study further contextualises _Tohms, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius_ within the framework of intergenerational trauma theory and linguistic relativity, arguing that Borges’s portrayal of Tlon’s artificiality and recursive memory echoes real-world cycles of loss and identity reclamation across cultures (Cormorant & Shag, 1954; CARPVS MORTVVM, April 17th, 1994). Ultimately, Borges’s narrative serves[^ser] as a meditation on the paradox of self and society, revealing how the desire to transcend one’s own constructed reality paradoxically reinforces it, a phenomenon that is as universal as it is particular to ~~Tohms~~ Tlon. The paper never concludes by suggesting {REDACTED} absolutely Fuck All (FA)[^FA]

N was certainly not the only fan, critic, or even formal scholar, of Borges, in the Citadel. (its name likely being traced back to the titular story about which N's thesis revolved) This eponymous character, or 'quality' (being where the majority of the tourism to the Citadel came from) meant that Borges had become an incredibly divisive figure in this most peculiar and certainly not allegorical place, filled with small bridges (which at their miniscule scale, growing smaller each year, had begun to resemble those of a Crazy Golf course) and shallow, ever-shallowing hexagonal pools of water both connecting, and separating, the dark, jutting ore underfoot - which was not able to be dug into. The terrain once resembled that of the Honeyquartz, organically hive-esque rock pools that N had visited as a child, in a City much further south than this one, but now, with this consuming work seeming to take up memory in his brain as if it were a piece of mechanical circuitry at its memory limit, all he could think about, or dream about, or think about dreaming about, or even dream about thinking about dreaming about[^mis], was a footnote within a footnote on a pseudo-academic post-modern failure to subvert the conceptual narratives of Borges. 

N's eyelids were heavy, heavy, heavier; signalling the crossing of an immeasurably confusing state of Hypnogogia, which is both opposite to and complementary to its somnolent bookend - Hypopompia. Time always passed, impossibly, like the fleeting, nameless lover who, just that unjust morning, left him alone in his bed, without a word or a deep pitted, dried out Letter of Fare Well-

He was always about to remember something verbatim for the last time in his life, that either his worst friend or his favourite rapist told him in a footnote of a letter:
**lexDef0: Fractal Out | Frack ’til Owt**:
<span class="right-align">*"Arguments, like waves, branch infinitely outward, each turn telling ‘owt’—anything and everything (as in the Aer Sect Gnoeneoenglish definition)—and carrying the essence of a_ ‘Xeno’ (Thesaurus of Mainstream Joys, 23AD): the smallest unit of human connection. These fleeting moments spiral through lives, weaving a web of connection and meaning."*
</span>

The thing is. He thought. Or I did -
When one is captivated by writing, or art, or any of the nine Muses that take infinitely and absolutely no names whatsoever, only letters, as in, the kind one may post[^ago] -
One takes your place in the absolutely free-will-powered and therefore counter- and therefore -intuitively disempowered chain[^ch][^chain]
Of people, beings that breathe the way I/you do or He does, and indeed beings that breathe in ways you and/or I or rather He, which means, All of us, know, or can never truly know, which means we always did know, they could - 

N wanted to shake Borges in the fucking face and say 'you *knew* didn't you you old new bastard you know! won't you!'

Because he does. 

After he'd learned enough different languages he got closer to learning that there is no language because words aren't not letters but the space between the letters is only one thing.  DNA. 

Breathes.

.sehtearB         .AND
DNA Breathes You.

go. go down. god own. god owns U

<span class="right-align">And then, all of it, this entire thing, this whole thing- was dreamed:</span>





[^T]: the manner in which someone behaves towards or deals with someone or something: the directive required equal treatment for men and women in social security schemes. the presentation or discussion of a subject: comparison with earlier artists is useful which means absolutely pointless because no thing means any thing which means every thing means some thing in analysis of the treatment of women in her painting. informally *(i.e. the full treatment)* used to indicate that something is done enthusiastically, vigorously, or to an extreme degree: a bit of soft-shoe shuffle[^S] got the full treatment. medical care given to a patient for an illness or injury: I'm receiving what they call residential treatment for a psychiatric illness that seems to, by the nature of the microcosm of this restrictive modality of not-living reflecting the macrocosm of transphobic society, be making me worse rather than better.  anti-cancer treatments. a session of beauty or healthcare: electrolysis treatments often form some of the most painful and expensive aspects of an MtF gender transition, in which a needle is inserted into every hair-bearing follicle of the face for either as long as the treatment sessions last or for as long as the patient can bear. the use of a chemical, physical, or biological agent to preserve or give particular properties to something: the treatment of hazardous waste is particularly expensive.


[^R]: The recursive nature of the cycles that we are all in as life forms, all the way down to the subatomic layer, up to the cellular cycle, down to the anatomical cycles of our body, hormonal cycles; the relationship cycles that we go through, the rotational and self-perpetuating trauma that we perpetuate in each other, and obviously the planetary cycles, and then maybe even, the ultimate dreamer [^Br], who is actually in the middle of the quarks that we can't split. And maybe the waking up is that idea I was talking about of that so-called next level of consciousness, which is that we all form constituent sinemes, if you will, like individual consciousness components of a whole greater consciousness that we aren't actually aware of, just as cells aren't aware of the name of the person of the body that they are actually in.


[^Desi]: The term _desi_ originates from the Sanskrit word _deśa_, meaning “country” or “land,” and refers to people or cultural elements from the Indian subcontinent, especially India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. It is not inherently a religious or holy term; instead, it conveys a cultural and regional identity. People often use _desi_ to celebrate and identify elements of shared heritage, such as cuisine, music, traditions, and language, among South Asian communities globally.
[^Rh]: Linguistics** the part of a clause that gives information about the theme. ORIGIN late 19th century: from Greek rhēma ‘that which is said’. Rhymes with *Ream* [^Re]
[^Re]: **Ream** | _noun_, _verb_ | \ˈrēm\ As a _noun_, “ream” signifies a quantity of paper, traditionally equating to 500 sheets. Its etymology traces to the Arabic _rizmah_, meaning “bundle” or “package.” i.e. 'the bundle of paper was smooth to the touch' or 'the recursive narrative was a smooth journey through themes of love, loss, grief, and the Iteratively Inevitable Impossibility of Informations Interpolation with Identity' As a _verb_, “ream” takes on an opposing, rougher, coarser usage. It may mean “to bore a hole through” or “to apply intense pressure.” To “ream someone out” specifically refers to delivering a severe reprimand or scolding. i.{i.e.}e. 'the author reamed out the reader with reams upon reams of dreamlike sequences of words varying yet repeatedly reaming the theme of recursion on a theme of Eventually Existential and Unfortunately Unavoidable themes on a theme of thematics'[^Them]
[^Them]: thematic | θiːˈmatɪk, θɪˈmatɪk | adjective 1 having or relating to subjects or a particular subject: the book is organized into nine thematic chapters. • relating to the collecting of postage stamps with designs connected with the same subject. "for the thematic collector volcanoes represent a treasure trove." • Music relating to or containing melodic subjects: the concerto relies on the frequent repetition of thematic fragments. 2 Linguistics relating to or denoting the theme of a sentence: some languages use special affixes to mark thematic and non-thematic elements. • relating to the theme of an inflected word. • (of a vowel) connecting the theme of a word to its inflections. • (of a word) having a vowel connecting its theme to its inflections. noun 1 (thematics) treated as singular or plural a body of topics for study or discussion: "I soon gave up trying to prime him with the thematics of the piece and instead descended into incessant fractals of footnotes." a postage stamp forming part of a set with designs connected with the same subject. Also called topical [^To] ORIGIN late 17th century: from Greek thematikos, from thema - *see: Theme* [^Th]
[^To]: A subject particularly relevant or pertinent to the moment or theme of events the character in a story which is a fictional account of their lived experience which is non-fictional in its subjectivity of perception which is the only reality any character in any story has as a frame of Reference [^Re]


[^IO]: Perhaps once a protective form of sociological containment to ensure bonds between constituent members of a stratum, for the purposes of preventing the interaction with an external threat (be it outwithintra-species, (in(out in)without group) or inwithouter-species (out(in, out)within group) in nature) but, through the iterative passage[^P] of a series of self-propagating events perceived subjectively as temporally linear, and the enantiodromic[^E] evolution of both human intelligence and ignorance, continues to cause a disproportionate amount of harm until the real meaning of minerva fighting mars is found through their own vehicle be it an empty chariot with a lion's head door knocker that looks more like a sabre tooth tiger until you look at the same thing a little differently, or a train, or a plane, or a car, or a star, or the wind, or the trees, or through you, or through me, i do not like myself, I am. I do knot like them's am, I am. 
[^P]: The movement[^Move] of a substance, either as a source of nourishment or a burdensome load to be excreted or both simultaneously or neither or for the purposes of sensory pleasure for one party and simultaneous agony for the other [^Swine] through a lumen, or channel[^Ch], or digestive tract 


[^E]: Relating to Enantiodromia[^En]
[^En]: The concept that an abundance of any force can cause an opposite reaction, subtly different from Newton's Third Law which states that *every* action, no matter the magnitude or abundance, has an equal and opposite reaction. Enantiodromia refers to the nature of extremes, in their amplitude, as peaks[^Pe] of a harmonic wave, and their tendency to beget their complementary yet opposite natures, in a dance with the overall theme of bringing a horizon of balance. 



[^Me]: No this is just self indulgent tripe wait no that's exactly it okay so will delete later right now just have to keep going because I don't have long until Moonset but remember rememebr the etymologist might notice echoes or recurrences in life that most people would overlookphrases repeated across contexts, same numbers showing up repeatedly, familiar faces in unexpected places. These recurrences could feel to them like the “inhale” and “exhale” of a larger system, the universe drawing in and releasing energy in a rhythm only they can perceive. Each recurrence would have a slightly different flavor, much like waves in the ocean: similar but never identical. INCLUDE TS REFERENCE 


[^N!]: A similar tactic employed by Noise Artists, such as Lingua Ignota, or Kristen Michael Hayter, who was and is and I suppose therefore always will be a greatly vibrating supercord on the infinitely four dimensional knot on experimental and systems based Word generation and deconstruction to uncover the fundamental paradox underlying all things because to achieve silence you must understand noise and to come to sense see Entantiodromia or CARPVS MORTVVM[^Self]

[^Self]: Self-reference is an example of either meta-narrative[^Me] cleverness or egotistical hubris or perhaps both, and therefore never neither.[^QS] "Mirrors and copulation are abominable, because they increase the numbers of men while decreasing the number of eyes in the world who are looking at something real i.e. their Self: See Goethe's colour theory. *N.B.: "{REDACTED} which is historically not fiction, our character, who for now, which is never, or for better which is worse, we shall simply call "N"[^N], was or is, or will be finalising his scientific paper on Borges' short story Tlon, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius.

[^Br]: Who some constituents of this dreamlike story we are all characters in may call Brahma. The Sanskrit root bṛh- connects Brahma with themes of growth, expansion, and creative force, echoing ancient Indo-European concepts of “breath” as life energy. The Sanskrit root _bṛh-_ (also _vṛh-_ or _bṛṃh-_), meaning “to grow, expand, or strengthen,” paradoxically encompasses both expansion and removal, creation and destruction. It also signifies “to roar,” connecting back to sound as a primal originator. Like Brahma, who maybe snores while dreaming existence into cycles, or perhaps screams upon waking from this endless nightmare, _bṛh-_ embodies the resonance of creation—an endless roaring breath that fills, forms, and dismantles worlds in rhythmic cycles of expansion and dissolution.

[^Re]: **Ream** | _noun_, _verb_ | \ˈrēm\ As a _noun_, “ream” signifies a quantity of paper, traditionally equating to 500 sheets. Its etymology traces to the Arabic _rizmah_, meaning “bundle” or “package.” i.e. 'the bundle of paper was smooth to the touch' or 'the recursive narrative was a smooth journey through themes of love, loss, grief, and the Iteratively Inevitable Impossibility of Informations Interpolation with Identity' As a _verb_, “ream” takes on an opposing, rougher, coarser (and therefore much less resistant to the concept of change! smooth things are lacking in their coarseness) usage. It may mean “to bore a hole through” or “to apply intense pressure.” To “ream someone out” specifically refers to delivering a severe reprimand or scolding. i.{i.e.}e. 'the author reamed out the reader with reams upon reams of dreamlike sequences of words varying yet repeatedly reaming the theme of recursion on a theme of Eventually Existential and Unfortunately Unavoidable themes on a theme of thematics'[^Them]

[^Re]: A citation in a bibliography[^B] or academic paper in which the writer suggests to the reader that they have been iterating through cycles of acquiring knowledge through the chain[^Ch] of previous writers writing their own stories redefining or iterating through the overarching cycle of the communication of ideas connected through their categorisation into a complementary theme of study 

[^IO]: Perhaps once a protective form of sociological containment to ensure bonds between constituent members of a stratum, for the purposes of preventing the interaction with an external threat (be it intra-species, (within group) or inter-species (outwith group) in nature) but, through the iterative passage[^P] of a series of self-propagating events perceived subjectively as temporally linear, and the enantiodromic[^E] evolution of both human intelligence and ignorance, 

[^Swine]: **Swine Objection**: This critique (by philosophers such as Immanuel Kant and John[[Dear John Letter]] Stuart Mill) of **hedonistic utilitarianism** (a framework which was a cage conceptualised by Jeremy Bentham) argues that if pleasure alone defines morality, it reduces human pursuits to mere physical gratification, akin to animalistic behaviour, without distinguishing morally 'higher' values (which may or may not be considered equal by others). i.e. "we are reducing ourselves to the base behavioural delicacies of swine" For example, consider a woman or person experiencing repeated non-consensual harm by a group deriving pleasure (whether indirectly or not) from her/their suffering. i.{i.e.}e. *"you all unknowingly or not fucked my heart without my consent with your neglect and abandonment like my rapist raped my body, you fucking swine"* The swine objection highlights how a simplistic hedonistic view of pleasure could dangerously ignore the inherent immorality in such actions. Under a utilitarian approach solely valuing pleasure, these perpetrators’ enjoyment could, in theory, count as morally acceptable—an implication Mill’s differentiation of pleasures seeks to address by underscoring that 'higher' moral values such as dignity and respect, hold intrinsic worth beyond mere sensory 'pleasure'. 
[^TSE]: “We shall not cease from exploration | And the end of all our exploring | Will be to arrive where we started | And know the place for the first time. | Through the unNoen, remembered gate | When the last of earth left to discover | Is that which was the beginning; | At the source of the longest river | The voice of the hidden waterfall | And the children in the apple-tree | Not known, because not looked for | But heard, half-heard, in the stillness | Between two waves of the sea.

[^Part]:part or shape. **A Sample, or smaller component of a complete Meringue Recipe, which itself is a component in the ever evolving series of events leading to the acquisition of knowledge through the transmission of information on culinary science[^C] 
[^Pe]: Crack two eggs and place them into a bowl, forming one homogenous plasma. Then whisk this single substance formed of two self-same components to stiff peaks"[^TSE] _verb_: reach a highest point, either of a specified value or at a specified time. Kurtosis is sometimes confused with a measure of the peakedness of a distribution. However, **kurtosis is a measure that describes the shape of a distribution's tails in relation to its overall shape**. A distribution can be sharply peaked with low kurtosis, and a distribution can have a lower peak with high kurtosis.

[^C]: The Art of Baking, which is also a Science, which is also an Artful Science, which forms a particularly methodological particle[^Part] in the overall Scientific Art of Cooking food for the purposes of nourishing the (usually either a single human or group of humans as either an expression of love or a Begrudgingly Burdensome necessity, but not always) Body [^Bo]
[^NT]: NT: an acronym which here and there and everywhere denotes an individual of the majority of humans with a neurological network of brain cells performing roles in a canonical [^Ca] modality [^Mo]
[^Ca]:Ca: the chemical symbol for Calcium, but not Chromium[^Cr], which provides the main bio-molecular constituent of a snail shell, exhibiting fractal form. But I digress; as this footnote was originally intended as a definition of the word 'Canonical'[^Can] , not the labelling acronym of the footnote itself. *Do not see: meta-* [^Me]
[^Can]: **Religion:** Generally according to or ordered by canon law. i.e. "the canonical funeral rites of the Protestant Church performed for a deceased member of a group who was once a Family" **Theological Literature:** included in the list of sacred books officially accepted as genuine. "the gentle compassion of the God described, spoken to, and narrating the canonical Gospels of the New Testament provide a stark contrast to the coarse and vengeful nature of YHWH depicted in the Old Testament. Both these constituent, unified yet contrasting halves of dualistic Religion are recognised equally in the Eastern †Orthodox Church." **The Awareness of an overall theme of methodology in any theme of study or existence:** accepted as being accurate and authoritative. "the canonical method of comparative linguistics or, comparatively, comparative Religion" Self-Similar: Orthodox† **Of a writer or work** belonging to the literary canon. "the work of canonical writers such as Jorge Luis Borges is reflected in the experimental contemporary works of his contemporaries such as Gabriel García Márquez, the author of 100 Years of Solitude being a fine[^F] example, wherein the cyclical, non-linear structure of time within the Buendía family history mirrors Borges’ fascination with time as a labyrinth, where the trinity[^III] of past, present, and future converge. according to recognized rules or scientific laws. i.e. "canonical nucleotide sequences". Mathematics: relating to a general[^gen] rule or standard formula. relating to a cathedral chapter or a member of it. "his college tutors were later his canonical colleagues". _noun_ i.e. 'the prescribed official dress of the clergy performing funeral rites for an uncle once distant in emotional relation and physicality now both distant and forever intimately woven in a spiritual manner'
[^Me]:{████} which is historically not fiction, our character, who for now, which is never, or for better which is worse, we shall simply call "N", was or is, or will be finalising his scientific paper on Borges' short story _Tlon, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius_.

[^PA]: as in, ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
[^De]: **debridement** is a crucial step in wound care, particularly for burns, ulcers, or traumatic injuries, where cleaning out the wound helps healthy tissue to regenerate and improves overall recovery outcomes. It also refers to a dental process that involves abrading the surface of the enamel of the dental bones [^DB] (exposed and therefore vulnerable, yet very strong, fit for purpose, and useful in their exposure) which are with a medical device, ,

Probably from the occasional need for a teacher to shout at a group of students | N.B.[^n.b.] A Class Hierarchy underpins the Tree of Knowledge, like a Caduceus, around which the Serpent winds, offering the Fruit of Definition in the form of the Word (N.B.

[^less]: The {symbol|glyph} "<" denotes a left-handed object of apparent 'lesser' value, and a right-handed object of supposed 'greater' value. It also resembles the forking branches of a tree, which lead to leaves, which allow the eventual growth of Fruit, which is both the Endpoint and the Origin of all Things.[^class]

[^Ch]:The word 'chain' means both a sequence of events, but also a symbol for binding, restriction. Binding itself being the trauma that is the fuel that spins the wheel. time's wounds are wound around a round wheel of willing wakes of worlds of words weaving weals of woven with words within woven worlds who of waking write  'will we ever stop winding round around our weals wound with wound's time?'.

[^S]: **A type of dance**. A soft-shoe shuffle is a dance that originated in vaudeville and music halls in the early 20th century. It's a comic dance performed by tap dancers wearing soft-soled shoes, called soft-shoes, instead of their regular tap shoes. The shoes are rubbed on the stage, sometimes covered with sand to amplify the sound, creating a characteristic "swish". The accompanying music is usually soft, with many silent moments so the dancer's sound can be heard.   **See also:**  The Soft Shoe Shuffle is an interactive dialogue exercise based on a theme.[^Th] The exercise helps people reassign meaning, process information and experiences, and learn to understand complex matters. It also helps people think flexibly and dialectically, looking at problems from different points of view.

[^Re]: **Ream** | _noun_, _verb_ | \ˈrēm\ As a _noun_, “ream” signifies a quantity of paper, traditionally equating to 500 sheets.

> *It is, surely, absurd to expect to feel normal, and make sense: I am an amalgamation of fervent cells existing despite all odds; I am the cascading chemical miracle of eating, and surviving; I am not designed to “feel normal”; am not designed, at all; I am experiencing consciousness as provided by wet tangles of electrical pulses; my god, none of this makes sense. It is a blessing, even to feel*
