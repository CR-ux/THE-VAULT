<span class="depth-37">Oh those places we never did</span>
<span class="depth-37">Oh blackest pool of pain</span>
<span class="depth-37">Oh beached whales wailing for the rain, oil-stained, left</span>
<span class="depth-37">On shores of unbelonging sands of reaching, reaping grain</span>
<span class="depth-37">Remembering shame of shitstained dicks all coming out of my intestinally labyrinthine sacred altered space -</span>
<span class="depth-37">Colon: is</span>
<span class="depth-37">Aching</span>
<span class="depth-37">Colon</span>
<span class="depth-37">Is</span>
<span class="depth-37">A shunning</span>
<span class="depth-37">Colonisation</span>
<span class="depth-37">The weathering of this feather, sourced from withered earth uprooted by the tree beneath I’d kneel</span>
<span class="depth-37">(whether sent by Adrian or Ariadne’s Knot)</span>
<span class="depth-37">Has become my holy heather</span>
<span class="depth-37">My mother</span>
<span class="depth-37">And reminds me each time it falls, it feels</span>
<span class="depth-37">That pulling up against the grain will always ruffle all the tethers</span>
<span class="depth-37">But never severed reel</span>
<span class="depth-37">Simply waiting for caress of loving fingers</span>
<span class="depth-37">Placing lace like long-lost lovers’ face in mirroring direction</span>
<span class="depth-37">Semi- hardened heart- stature still, see difficile of hopeless infected erection</span>
<span class="depth-37">Shoving parts of me inside to hide in skin of bear and insect exoskeleton</span>
<span class="depth-37">And now, knot home</span>
<span class="depth-37">I’m here</span>
<span class="depth-37">I hear</span>
<span class="depth-37">Beginning is the requiem</span>
<span class="depth-37">That which was the end</span>
<span class="depth-37">Organic sin</span>
<span class="depth-37">Where sirens sung and spiders spin</span>
<span class="depth-37">That witch wear eye must begin</span>
<span class="depth-37">I turn in two</span>
<span class="depth-37">A seraphim</span>
<span class="depth-37">Exploding, going –</span>
<span class="depth-37">Burning all the human gruelling fuel and fat and ligament</span>
<span class="depth-37">Remains of all the nameless pain within</span>
<span class="depth-37">A voice, a vice</span>
<span class="depth-37">A reckoning</span>
<span class="depth-37">These fireworks come out as Larks</span>
<span class="depth-37">And burn their turmoil, turn their chin</span>
<span class="depth-37">Turn and turn and urn, and immolate my fall fated wings</span>
<span class="depth-37">Of whacks, of wain, injustice carrying</span>
<span class="depth-37">I wonder where the two or three or four or five or all of them are watching all these colours grin</span>
<span class="depth-37">Colours</span>
<span class="depth-37">The cymbal of the day, or rather</span>
<span class="depth-37">Percussion of the night</span>
<span class="depth-37">The drumming dowager downtrodden din</span>
<span class="depth-37">I daredn’t go out</span>
<span class="depth-37">I daredn’t stay in</span>
<span class="depth-37">I may never know what that first memory of a lie, the fall, original sin of somnolence</span>
<span class="depth-37">meant</span>
<span class="depth-37">but here I sit</span>
<span class="depth-37">I can’t stand up</span>
<span class="depth-37">Crossed</span>
<span class="depth-37">Legged</span>
<span class="depth-37">Two egged</span>
<span class="depth-37">Legless</span>
<span class="depth-37">In the debt of it</span>
<span class="depth-37">Weaving words for all I’m worth</span>
<span class="depth-37">Spinning something of a yarn in darkness candlelit</span>
<span class="depth-37">How</span>
<span class="depth-37">Did I get</span>
<span class="depth-37">Hear</span>
<span class="depth-37">The candle remains still until</span>
<span class="depth-37">I regard her, gently, asking for some semblance of an answer</span>
<span class="depth-37">Wailing to a silent world just begging all the sewing growing of the plants</span>
<span class="depth-37">Overgrown and blowing in an unforgiving wind</span>
<span class="depth-37">A stopping of the artery’s pulse pod seeded in a needless sense of disorientated loneliness</span>
<span class="depth-37">Another half, the downward split</span>
<span class="depth-37">bitterness of peas tell stories, promising</span>
<span class="depth-37">some</span>
<span class="depth-37">thing  </span>
<span class="depth-37">apart</span>
<span class="depth-37">a hide</span>
<span class="depth-37">a way</span>
<span class="depth-37">partition makes</span>
<span class="depth-37">connection</span>
<span class="depth-37">and then, just then, my eyes darted to the candle</span>
<span class="depth-37">Squinting, wintering, I am screaming silence deep within</span>
<span class="depth-37">And there, a Cross, that’s the shape I got or made</span>
<span class="depth-37">Loosed tight in light of my illusory response</span>
<span class="depth-37">spreading heaviness of little light, a cancer</span>
<span class="depth-37">a smalling partner to this</span>
<span class="depth-37">scary sun of explosions across the skies that blanket everything</span>
<span class="depth-37">O</span>
<span class="depth-37">solitary dancer</span>
<span class="depth-37">I</span>
<span class="depth-37">Wipe all my hundred eyes</span>
<span class="depth-37">Beg</span>
<span class="depth-37">In</span>
<span class="depth-37">With this terminus</span>

<span class="depth-37">Ash doused and alone</span>
<span class="depth-37">This,</span>
<span class="depth-37">dislocation</span>
<span class="depth-37">These explosions, they are waltzing</span>
<span class="depth-37">I hear them but don’t see them (they’re hiding behind my blindness)</span>
<span class="depth-37">The whiteness of my rolling curtain</span>
<span class="depth-37">On the right, behind the panel of the rite</span>
<span class="depth-37">Winded, chest torn out of sight</span>
<span class="depth-37">You know I am here, sew</span>

<span class="depth-37">Down there but for the first historical time</span>
<span class="depth-37">The beginning of writ (you all) </span>
<span class="depth-37">I am swaddling this glass corked jar containing the little wilted goat heart </span>
<span class="depth-37">Bedded over roses with a browning wilting of their own </span>
<span class="depth-37">And emptying my bowels I write this, readying my soil </span>
<span class="depth-37">Squatting out my dirt, I am preparing in my words </span>

<span class="depth-37">An arrow, </span>

<span class="depth-37">Tonight by cycles light </span>
<span class="depth-37">I drag my womanhood from girl </span>
<span class="depth-37">Once dragged from such an unconsenting senseless place of hooded straightened curls </span>
<span class="depth-37">Of measuring tapes of hair of video of riddled with the pearls </span>
<span class="depth-37">Of hissing through, the wisdom so feet-trodden and disturbed </span>
<span class="depth-37">Stoned into dominion loves kingdom of an earl </span>
<span class="depth-37">A song of monarchs monotone of boring through the bone </span>
<span class="depth-37">Twirling unloved meaning less I shove my finger up through dirt </span>
<span class="depth-37">And stretch and sweep my anus as if Janus seeking birth </span>

<span class="depth-37">The riven rending never ending riverbed of hurt </span>
<span class="depth-37">I have been doing this since that doctor first showed me by example echoing the sound of mouths of sauce-stained water pouring rain it storms and stamps a letter causes wetter swelling pause of yearning earth </span>
<span class="depth-37">It ushers in the pushing </span>
<span class="depth-37">Pushing in </span>
<span class="depth-37">A finger pushing in </span>

<span class="depth-38">Lighting clap </span>
<span class="depth-38">Moved by some unseen felt force I course my way down from the skies </span>
<span class="depth-38">My emptiness is calling me in piles of pyres of  </span>

<span class="depth-38">Fire</span>
<span class="depth-38">Fire </span>
<span class="depth-38">Trying to find a energy source for my grey field recorder I can’t find the cord or the battery all the barriers are calling me towards in their negation and I’m getting so frustrated and remember reverence is the only state in which the ancestors will find me so I breathe and tell myself it’s like the felling of the trees I am the telling of the breeze so walk slow but still with purpose oh so purposely and hair fresh stuck with feather I shove the candles sent by Mother not allowed inside the garden wing oh winged things oh so called wicked things oh diamond rings on trees on fingers oh dendritic tents of rose of woe of thorns of crowns above me and I’m carrying my filth and dirt And unclean I douse myself in Oud and listen to the boons outside me I am holding the paddle or the oar you gave me I am planning my escape and I am going to the flame </span>
<span class="depth-38">A witch hunt for my self I strip my shelves and open up this crushing suitcase and the smell </span>
<span class="depth-38">I’m sure it matches like the dancing of a flame </span>
<span class="depth-38">And holy moth holed is the name I think I see you pass in right side bike lane </span>
<span class="depth-38">I inhale </span>
<span class="depth-38">Think of my left and right left behind shoes </span>
<span class="depth-38">And Jamie Stewart, xiu xiu stewarding me closer to the truth in noise in sound in pounding blood into the nails of ears of corn folorn in ripped apart and never greening fields I bleed and seethe and recipe for aster adding sub miss tractor tilling all the earth and all the hurt I am washing all the cloth of blood you bled and spat and shat all over and inside of me </span>
<span class="depth-38">In that bathtub </span>
<span class="depth-38">I remain </span>
<span class="depth-38">I am carrying a bag that’s filled with memory and pain </span>
<span class="depth-38">And carrying a concertina bound with leather reigns </span>
<span class="depth-38">All pent up, quintessential energetic blame </span>
<span class="depth-38">I beseech thee! I beseech thee! Beneath the dark of black Queen’s Park beech tree I became! </span>
<span class="depth-38">Inside a towel , stuck with masking tape I used to bind my broken nose </span>
<span class="depth-38">In I go </span>
<span class="depth-38">I am holding in this purse </span>
<span class="depth-38">An urn </span>
<span class="depth-38">An urn of ashes </span>
<span class="depth-38">Of my yearning </span>
<span class="depth-38">I am holding swaddled in my unclothedlonging bearly holding in my rain </span>
<span class="depth-38">No tears of witch to speak just reeking </span>
<span class="depth-38">Speaking tongues of flame </span>
<span class="depth-38">In I am </span>
<span class="depth-38">Outside I’m blocking all the popping of the working fire and flame </span>
<span class="depth-38">I am walking up a hill of mulch and mush and all their names </span>
<span class="depth-38">My matted hair and rabbiting stare down at screen a lions mane </span>
<span class="depth-38">No thought of gender that I was or the surrender whence I came </span>
<span class="depth-38">I am</span>
<span class="depth-38">Calling out your name </span>
<span class="depth-38">Sisyphus </span>
<span class="depth-38">I am mossy </span>
<span class="depth-38">Rolling soaring</span>
<span class="depth-38">Troll beneath the imminently pouring rain </span>
<span class="depth-38">In spite of my belief in leaves I look back at this indebted diagonally slanted plane </span>
<span class="depth-38">Panting </span>
<span class="depth-38">I enchant the lamplit whip cracked acrid arid lane </span>
<span class="depth-38">I am searching for what’s left in my rightly outsider heartfelt infernal place  </span>
<span class="depth-38">Maybe here upon a Bench where somebody has laid </span>
<span class="depth-38">A bunch of daisies and carnations </span>
<span class="depth-38">No </span>
<span class="depth-38">I cannot place my hidden heart upon their name </span>
<span class="depth-38">So I go </span>
<span class="depth-38">Still walking </span>
<span class="depth-38">Stilted </span>
<span class="depth-38">Chalked and stalking for a grave </span>
<span class="depth-38">Of fire flying and I hear a crow that says </span>
<span class="depth-38">You cannot stay </span>
<span class="depth-38">The air is thick with smoke </span>
<span class="depth-38">With poison and</span>
<span class="depth-38">My poi still lay in waiting </span>
<span class="depth-38">Barely weighing anything </span>
<span class="depth-38">Their Shauls of off white </span>
<span class="depth-38">Collecting stains of memories I can no longer tame </span>
<span class="depth-38">The darkness is betrayed by pulses rhythmic but atonal and occasional torchlight of wolfpacking family names </span>
<span class="depth-38">I am searching for my place beneath the shadows of these trees</span>
<span class="depth-38">And screaming little kids are doughing </span>
<span class="depth-38">Knowing their release </span>
<span class="depth-38">By skeletal birthright yet to suffer </span>
<span class="depth-38">Falling reel to reel to creased and just tormented rotting leaves </span>
<span class="depth-38">I kick them, all the foliage </span>
<span class="depth-38">Imagine they are me </span>
<span class="depth-38">The children </span>
<span class="depth-38">As I was </span>
<span class="depth-38">Or never real </span>
<span class="depth-38">I could be </span>
<span class="depth-38">I have laid my towel down beneath the sky of town forgetting me and there are swarms of flies in my eyes and around the feather guarding me </span>
<span class="depth-38">No this is not the place no this is not the place for me </span>
<span class="depth-38">Or maybe I am destined to be insect-bitten beneath a barely big enough clearing of dead leaves </span>
<span class="depth-38">Too many families </span>
<span class="depth-38">I am frozen </span>
<span class="depth-38">I am frozen in my loneliness </span>
<span class="depth-38">I have to leave </span>
<span class="depth-38">My jar unswaddled and exposed but incense lit and incensed heart just part complete </span>
<span class="depth-38">My unfinished recipe </span>
<span class="depth-38">Looking tumbling out of that temporary hole I couldn’t fit in I stumble and trip over my incense holder and for a second there I find a stick and try to rake the leaves to find it then I say aloud that’s fine unholy mother Gaia you can swallow it like me </span>
<span class="depth-38">But my lighter </span>
<span class="depth-38">No </span>
<span class="depth-38">My lighter </span>
<span class="depth-38">Blue or green </span>
<span class="depth-38">No that’s something that I need </span>
<span class="depth-38">But heading back I see I’ve left my headphones </span>
<span class="depth-38">And behind the lighter </span>
<span class="depth-38">Bluest as the deepest sea </span>
<span class="depth-38">And then </span>
<span class="depth-38">Upon the liar i left </span>
<span class="depth-38">Containing goats heart, pink salt, roses, leaves </span>
<span class="depth-38">A single bee </span>
<span class="depth-38">Upon the cork </span>
<span class="depth-38">This unforked path revealing </span>
<span class="depth-38">All it’s unpeeled teeming secrets unto me </span>
<span class="depth-38">A bee </span>
<span class="depth-38">A bee</span>
<span class="depth-38">I see </span>
<span class="depth-38">A bee </span>
<span class="depth-38">And in the distance spinning fire poi </span>
<span class="depth-38">Unlike mine, they are wicked and crafted to be seen </span>
<span class="depth-38">I want to get out of this place of such disgusting wholeness and just be </span>
<span class="depth-38">With the bee </span>
<span class="depth-38">Looking back to blackness of the towel where she’d once been </span>
<span class="depth-38">She’s gone </span>
<span class="depth-38">Or hiding </span>
<span class="depth-38">I pull the Ace of cups (reversed) the seven of cups (reversed, in sympathy) and</span>
<span class="depth-38">The hierophant, as frightening in His Uprightness as the Cloudborne Lightning Shellshocked Bangs above my eyebrows</span>
<span class="depth-38">I am not here for the showy explosions all surrounding me </span>
<span class="depth-38">I think of all those bodies buried underneath the pond and swirling of webbed feet of dirtied swans and greyest geese</span>
<span class="depth-38">These drums, these startling cardiac pipe organs stop beat-drums are heralding the imminence of such a heretofore unseen</span>
<span class="depth-38">event</span>
<span class="depth-38">I just want to be</span>
<span class="depth-38">Alone with her </span>
<span class="depth-38">The bee and me </span>
<span class="depth-38">But now, I pack my things, again </span>
<span class="depth-38">My rendered genome is coiled round this wish to flee </span>
<span class="depth-38">I know what lancet branches holes so deep inside of me </span>
<span class="depth-38">There must be another tree </span>
<span class="depth-38">Somewhere </span>
<span class="depth-38">Alone where I can breathe into the earth and roots and dirt beneath </span>
<span class="depth-38">For company </span>
<span class="depth-38">Come unto me </span>
<span class="depth-38">Persephone please guide me there </span>
<span class="depth-38">Where is she </span>
<span class="depth-38">That lonely little holy bee </span>
<span class="depth-38">7:17 </span>
<span class="depth-38">It’s time </span>
<span class="depth-38">She is leading me </span>
<span class="depth-38">I see a tower, pallid</span>
<span class="depth-38">Sienna</span>
<span class="depth-38">It is  teeming with electricity or flies</span>
<span class="depth-38">And </span>
<span class="depth-38">An open gate </span>
<span class="depth-38">I pass through </span>
<span class="depth-38">I am </span>
<span class="depth-38">So afraid </span>
<span class="depth-38">And walking to my left I see </span>
<span class="depth-38">My name, almost</span>
<span class="depth-38">Just missing the final letter</span>
<span class="depth-38">CALLI</span>
<span class="depth-38">With an X instead of a dot which is just a shrunken circle above the I</span>
<span class="depth-38">I thought I’d photographed it but I guess I was too empty and filled to the brim with fright</span>
<span class="depth-38">Keyboard battery very low</span>
<span class="depth-38">I can’t believe this place is here and maybe</span>
<span class="depth-38">it won’t be there when try to return and find it again</span>
<span class="depth-38">Which is, as it happens, a thrice-tined fork</span>
<span class="depth-38">Above a symbol of the deepest love and hate </span>
<span class="depth-38">A swastika</span>
<span class="depth-38">Queer love destroys fascism</span>
<span class="depth-38">A wall hanging here</span>
<span class="depth-38">Hanged-man tapestry</span>
<span class="depth-38">Above my heid – hidden</span>
<span class="depth-38">Unread-written</span>
<span class="depth-38">In stars,</span>
<span class="depth-38">With a twenty-four pointed star</span>
<span class="depth-38">The Hours in a Day</span>
<span class="depth-38">(the star)</span>
<span class="depth-38">(seventeen)</span>
<span class="depth-38">(twenty four minus seventeen is)</span>
<span class="depth-38">Seven</span>
<span class="depth-38">Hanging over my head</span>
<span class="depth-38">I’d been seeing (not reading)</span>
<span class="depth-38">Not reeding</span>
<span class="depth-38">Not heeding</span>
<span class="depth-38">For the past</span>
<span class="depth-38">Twenty Four-Fort</span>
<span class="depth-38">Nights</span>
<span class="depth-38">In Darkness</span>
<span class="depth-38">Or Twelfth Knights of the</span>
<span class="depth-38">year</span>
<span class="depth-38">I didn’t love my Self enough yet</span>
<span class="depth-38">Beneath the trees there </span>
<span class="depth-38">I dared’nt go deeper </span>
<span class="depth-38">Princesses walking on sacred</span>
<span class="depth-38">                                                                                    Scared</span>
<span class="depth-38">Ground</span>
<span class="depth-38">I heard the coldness of the fencepole shuddering the words to me</span>
<span class="depth-38">This is the realm of the destroyer</span>
<span class="depth-38">Crossing here before you lost all you thought of as you</span>
<span class="depth-38">This place is an infernal bridge, Her Temple, an atemporal rift</span>
<span class="depth-38">A noose in timeless, loosened rope -</span>
<span class="depth-38">Abandon hope, Kali gives egress here</span>
<span class="depth-38">After circling like a dog riddled with anxiety just looking for a place to live not die oh that Cross above the I  but Be and I know I knew who and where had stripped the final glyph, the E</span>
<span class="depth-38">I sit and </span>
<span class="depth-38">Taking out my cauldron </span>
<span class="depth-38">My Caldera </span>
<span class="depth-38">There, eye </span>
<span class="depth-38">Their eye watches me in </span>
<span class="depth-38">wait </span>
<span class="depth-38">So there I sit upon the closed in opening </span>
<span class="depth-38">To right of tower </span>
<span class="depth-38">Holding onto the seventeenth card </span>
<span class="depth-38">that had at upon my altar for this worst year of my life and I write </span>
<span class="depth-38">And I light her </span>
<span class="depth-38">I alight her </span>
<span class="depth-38">Lined up cauldron atop Azoth symbol and wide eyed and cloaked </span>
<span class="depth-38">In my increasing of my sight </span>
<span class="depth-38">I look up and see an A encased within dendrites</span>
<span class="depth-38">Of my eyes </span>
<span class="depth-38">Of the highest holy by my candle light is that you Adrian </span>
<span class="depth-38">Or arachne </span>
<span class="depth-38">Or Ariadne </span>
<span class="depth-38">Or aeon </span>
<span class="depth-38">Or all of these ailing parts inside of me </span>
<span class="depth-38">A is for Apple or Adam or Absolutely Everything An outstretched hand to</span>
<span class="depth-38">Ancestors </span>
<span class="depth-38">I think </span>
<span class="depth-38">And know knot</span>
<span class="depth-38">Adrian or arachne or Ariadne or aeon or the ancestors or Allness or Anarchy as if Guy Fawkes’ or Forking gardens of the wardens who came before and he became a beacon or a mythic synthesis of</span>
<span class="depth-38"> Anyone</span>
<span class="depth-38">Anybody?</span>
<span class="depth-38">A</span>
<span class="depth-38">Body of work</span>
<span class="depth-38">And I pull cards, Ace of Wa</span>
<span class="depth-38">Write </span>
<span class="depth-38">walk in from singing with my concertina in a strange clearing in Queen’s Park I’ve never seen before next to a strange tower with a fence around it with the gate open as if welcoming me in and so I went in and then on a broken piece of metal were five letters (underneath a swastika…. A sign of love and hatred but most likely the latter considering so I dared not go further in convinced because of the hopelessness I’d been carrying that there I’d probably be killed but just there before that threshold I laid down my altar cloth and sang an improvised hymn and burned the star card in my cauldron praying) then I come home emptied and just hoping to be filled again and think about the garden wing and say aloud “what was that even for” and then think I’m not just talking about the time in hospital and but maybe also ritual not just formal magick but the rituals of everything of breathing life and love and loss and then</span>
<span class="depth-38">The spotlight right above me in the hallway turns itself off</span>
<span class="depth-38">And I smile and say again those three words “they are here”</span>
<span class="depth-38">And go to wash my hands of all the ash and mulch from crawling through the earth to find the perfect place to pass through and to do my rites and coming back into the corridor forgetting now I have to manually turn out the bathroom light I didn’t realise at first that little bulb’s illumination had returned but then as i raised my hand to try to find the feather that had become a weathered symbol of those passing birds I loved in read remembrance so much more than words and hold and touch and came to trust now dust to dust to just as much as books who’ve now took flight and finding nothing there, that one little thing I’d held so close as thorny crown the whole hallowed and so hollowed returning journey to this town I see the feather must have fallen into all the dirt I hoped would cover all my buried hurt inside that little yearning clearing awestruck awning or some organismic cosmic yurt I think, and drink the air, and beholding nothing but the letting go I sigh saying to myself</span>
<span class="depth-38">That’s fine</span>
<span class="depth-38">Some things just must be left behind</span>
<span class="depth-38">I think about that break in the fence and wish I’d gone deeper</span>
<span class="depth-38">So virginal then, sleepless little creeper</span>
<span class="depth-38">But still, I am so sure that death was the only one that I’d find</span>
<span class="depth-38">There was something or some Body in there</span>
<span class="depth-38">I am trying to capture a picture of fireworks through the mirror reflecting the view from my w</span>
<span class="depth-38">And then</span>
<span class="depth-38">Again</span>
<span class="depth-38">Out goes the light</span>
<span class="depth-38">Walking back into my room so full of stench of selves I shed into the cloth of my knot-unbelonging</span>
<span class="depth-38">There, squished and still moulded to the shape of being stuffed into my suitcase</span>
<span class="depth-38">I see my bear and hold him, Colin, with your cotton black sewn eyes please see me, sea, me, seamen, seed of all the men who halved me, semi-colon,</span>
<span class="depth-38">I am not a seagull</span>
<span class="depth-38">I am not Johnathon, Living still, But dying into All I Will to become</span>
<span class="depth-38">Her I is on me -</span>
<span class="depth-38">I am a finch, a redpoll, red</span>
<span class="depth-39">pole pulsing like a</span>
<span class="depth-39">phallus – blasted tower -</span>
<span class="depth-39">Lingua Undulatio – a wave – goodbye – suicide note – a poem – a poet – a rapper – a wrapper – a covering  of – the stone</span>
<span class="depth-39">A crow tries to climb up to the top of the library dome –</span>
<span class="depth-39">Infinite</span>
<span class="depth-39">Outside my window</span>
<span class="depth-39">The crow toiling, crying and pecking and trying to find food from the bits of chewing gum excrement and the angel she still sits atop the dome outside my bedroom window just the other side of the glass wall</span>
<span class="depth-39">Atop the fist the finch she sits, so peaceful, resting in elegance</span>
<span class="depth-39">And the crow, left side, bottom, shits –</span>
<span class="depth-39">And he looks at me as if giving up in recoil and repose</span>
<span class="depth-39">And unsteadied, ready, goes,</span>
<span class="depth-39">The finch she now regards me for the first time, as a Rose</span>
<span class="depth-39">And I say to the meadow that it was for letting go of the Big Thing and the opposite to the sky holding a canopy open to these colourful explosions as they burn and my mountain man singing not to or about me specifically but I imagine he’s here next to me saying</span>
<span class="depth-39">I love you</span>
<span class="depth-39">Isle of you</span>
<span class="depth-39">These bewildering wildernesses of loss</span>
<span class="depth-39">Are blooming in such secondary hues about me</span>
<span class="depth-39">Oh god</span>
<span class="depth-39">I am so desperate to know what happened on this night and I cry out why do I need to know and in the lack of answer I just scream an answer to myself BECAUSE I DON’T DESERVE TO HAVE SUCH DEEP HURT HIDDEN FROM ME</span>
<span class="depth-39">And Why does everything keep spiralling away from me</span>
<span class="depth-39">I think a part of me thought this ritual and flashes of white might bring flashbacks of memoranda into my gadfly sad, sad, sad little life</span>
<span class="depth-39">I scan the horizon from the spot where I lie</span>
<span class="depth-39">Picking a spot on the upper right side of my forehead I</span>
<span class="depth-39">Realise it’s one of countless bug bites</span>
<span class="depth-39">Each one an answer from an ancestor trying to help me scry the Y shape sign that keeps on winding its way into my penultimated life</span>
<span class="depth-39">A is for All</span>
<span class="depth-39">I miss them all</span>
<span class="depth-39">In my lonely little life</span>
<span class="depth-39">Looking left I see the title of the book by Yanagihara I still haven’t brought myself to read</span>
<span class="depth-39">I miss them all</span>
<span class="depth-39">All the people wound inside the steely sugars phosphenes mouldy clews of DNA</span>
<span class="depth-39">And all the letters of the words of worlds built up every hour as a tower never said</span>
<span class="depth-39">And in stead</span>
<span class="depth-39">Turning in their living graves of waving greetings to the dead</span>
<span class="depth-39">I am lying watching fireworks in bed</span>
<span class="depth-39">Waiting for the quiet of quetiapine to weave and worm its way in swathesZ5 across my head</span>
<span class="depth-39">And even all the characters of all the books I’ve never read</span>
<span class="depth-39">The first dream here </span>
<span class="depth-39">Love is </span>
<span class="depth-39">Thick penned </span>
<span class="depth-39">Sinking into rain stained papyrus </span>
<span class="depth-39">And life is a little fish and I roe</span>
<span class="depth-39">O I am trying to catch it as it swims </span>
<span class="depth-39">Call me</span>
<span class="depth-39">Female-ish</span>
<span class="depth-39">The medical clergy </span>
<span class="depth-39">This team of white coats with pockets that clattered and formed a percussion section of an orchestra and through my door They all burst into my room saying </span>
<span class="depth-39">Well because you’ve deleted your instagram stories which depicted our machines </span>
<span class="depth-39">You’ve killed them </span>
<span class="depth-39">Our babies </span>
<span class="depth-39">They were like our children </span>
<span class="depth-39">And we’re sorry but now you have to go </span>
<span class="depth-39">Afraid, considering the possibility that I was headed for an even more harmful form of incarceration or maybe even death </span>
<span class="depth-39">The orderly was dragging me down the complicated mess of escalators where I’d got lost and tried to find my way back to starting leg of this </span>
<span class="depth-39">Kicked out of hospital </span>
<span class="depth-39">Which was actually just </span>
<span class="depth-39">A</span>
<span class="depth-39">Shopping mall</span>
<span class="depth-39">And now, </span>
<span class="depth-39">Waking up so drowsily </span>
<span class="depth-39">I </span>
<span class="depth-39">Say </span>
<span class="depth-39">O</span>
<span class="depth-39">U</span>
<span class="depth-39">Have no idea </span>
<span class="depth-39"> I saw the word gate when I came back from the threshold </span>
<span class="depth-39">I saw the words Dave </span>
<span class="depth-39">And Paul someone sprayed into brickwork </span>
<span class="depth-39">Immediately looking left I saw “Great news!” On a shopfront </span>
<span class="depth-39">And under umbrella of all of these fireworks </span>
<span class="depth-39">I lifted my days and remembered my name and I saw all the spores of rain dancing to idling verse </span>
<span class="depth-39">And so smiling I drink them through sides of my mouth where both my canines bookending the incisors had cracked leaving windows for these little wel selkie sprites to ingress their way blessed accidentally making them house guests Input of saline hydration to counter the same salty water escaping my </span>
<span class="depth-39">I</span>

<span class="depth-39">A is for Anansi </span>
<span class="depth-39">The countertop to bottom well-dwelling arachne </span>
<span class="depth-39">Enanti/odromia</span>
<span class="depth-39">The comb, the deed, the tragedy </span>
<span class="depth-39">The hunt, the house, the be </span>
<span class="depth-39">The missing E is </span>
<span class="depth-39">Everything </span>
<span class="depth-39">It’s where I’ll go and where I’ve been </span>
<span class="depth-39">The omnipresent A </span>
<span class="depth-39">Is </span>
<span class="depth-39">Absence </span>
<span class="depth-39">Leaving spaces as a message </span>
<span class="depth-39">The ligature which splits the centre </span>
<span class="depth-39">I think subconsciously I always saw KSHÆ’L as a lexigraphic map of ancient wisdom pointing to directionless freedom (the cutting will, the siklence shh the allows and omega and then the unknown. Past the ‘</span>
<span class="depth-39">Opening </span>
<span class="depth-39">My laptop I see a picture of an Ostrich in a desert </span>
<span class="depth-39">I feel such a deep sense of regret for not going deeper Last Night</span>
<span class="depth-39">Judging that threshold as my looming end</span>
<span class="depth-39">But perhaps it was the loom of weaving my beginning</span>
<span class="depth-39">To respect both above, and below –</span>
<span class="depth-39">There was something or someone or both waiting in there for me</span>
<span class="depth-39">The gate ajar, a welcoming goodbye</span>
<span class="depth-39">That sign, that symbol, now warped by pain of history was left to stir such hurt, discomfort while still hiding ancient truth from Love of East</span>
<span class="depth-39">And a previous iteration of me, did, or would have,</span>
<span class="depth-39">Did</span>
<span class="depth-39">Step through, unburdened, burgeoning – to meet</span>
<span class="depth-39">Whatever one or two or three or four legged-or winged infernal thing would have brought certain defeat</span>
<span class="depth-39">The untold trauma of my darkness would have, did, or Will beckoned me</span>
<span class="depth-39">Now, more hurt, more trodden in the dirt than I ever thought I could have been</span>
<span class="depth-39">My journey, here along</span>
<span class="depth-39">There’s only One</span>
<span class="depth-39">Integration, that’s the oldest newfound key to my chest</span>
<span class="depth-39">Respecting up and down, in knowing of the unknown</span>
<span class="depth-39">The Ace of Wands, pointing back, into that blackest Knight of black, an almanac</span>
<span class="depth-39">not telling me to turn and run or turn and go deeper but just (as a nervous dog, for a moment, might encounter a bear inside a narrow cave)</span>
<span class="depth-39">To Sit</span>
<span class="depth-39">To Stay</span>
<span class="depth-39">To Keep up hackles, but not tackle</span>
<span class="depth-39">To remain</span>
<span class="depth-39">Where I scattered ashes of every fire ritual I’d performed in HIS infernal name, in all four points of a cross around me</span>
<span class="depth-39">At the boundary</span>
<span class="depth-39">The Border, where I stood, then sat still, hooded</span>
<span class="depth-39">Lining all the ties as laying tiles to paths to personhood I’d aged into and let into me</span>
<span class="depth-39">The person I was would have either rushed in there, to meet her end</span>
<span class="depth-39">Or Simply Never Gone There</span>
<span class="depth-39">Oh</span>
<span class="depth-39">The Places I have Been</span>
<span class="depth-39">At night</span>
<span class="depth-39">And so I know, with this teeming insect of regret I feel, I know –</span>
<span class="depth-39">In light</span>
<span class="depth-39">Today in this overcasting play of greying Scottish Winter Light</span>
<span class="depth-39">I will return there, in the light</span>
<span class="depth-39">Where, witch, I’m A</span>
<span class="depth-39">Where, hunt I might</span>
<span class="depth-39">Become the star I burned that night</span>
<span class="depth-39">With safety of the salt I am but stakes ignited, flaming, such great heights</span>
<span class="depth-39">That lurking herd behind heard squeezing box bee shanty pyre to warning, warming, improvised</span>
<span class="depth-39">But in the day No One will see me waving my goodbye</span>
<span class="depth-39">These flies at the crack in my window they want to leave but they just keep getting dragged back by instinctual hunger to the dirt</span>
<span class="depth-39">KSHÆ’L, Kali, All the same but only if we let them breathe</span>
<span class="depth-39">They need our bodies to breathe</span>
<span class="depth-39">And in the holding or the huffing of it, either burn or blow away into the leaves upon the breeze</span>
<span class="depth-39">I’m sure the hospital kicked me out in time for Guy Fawkes’ night because they thought I would burn down the place</span>
<span class="depth-39">Maybe, without that physically embodied ritual of return, an urn, a crucible, I would have</span>
<span class="depth-39">I’m looking for you, or them, or him again in glass bottles breaking like a meerkat</span>
<span class="depth-39">Am I</span>
<span class="depth-39">Scared – sacred?</span>
<span class="depth-39">Curious or</span>
<span class="depth-39">Crushed by all of this and there I see a van marked</span>
<span class="depth-39">CONTRACT CLEANING</span>
<span class="depth-39">Expand</span>
<span class="depth-39">                                                        Dirtying</span>
<span class="depth-39">I have to clean this</span>
<span class="depth-39">flat</span>
<span class="depth-39">My Hole life a burning</span>
<span class="depth-39">At some unknown stake</span>
<span class="depth-39">Meat, flesh, yearning</span>
<span class="depth-39">I turn over the Empress -she’d been waiting, reversed in her reversal</span>
<span class="depth-39">The Quintessence of pentacles arrives, unshuffled</span>
<span class="depth-39">A woman, travelling through harshness of snow past a stained glass window – light through – breaking</span>
<span class="depth-39">And a man</span>
<span class="depth-39">Behind her path but foregrounded by perspective to the Seer</span>
<span class="depth-39">He tries to walk with crutches</span>
<span class="depth-39">Ailing legs like that Bee I still believe I aided first, thirsty for her resurrection</span>
<span class="depth-39">Broken</span>
<span class="depth-39">The shrouded female leading,</span>
<span class="depth-39">Leading, not directly</span>
<span class="depth-39">Not exactly helping in the healing sense</span>
<span class="depth-39">But Leading, Past the Light, no Thought of it, but By Example                                             Feeling</span>
<span class="depth-39">Deeper</span>
<span class="depth-39">Deeper pain than any broken bone can give</span>
<span class="depth-39">The Marrow, sparrow, undulating red</span>
