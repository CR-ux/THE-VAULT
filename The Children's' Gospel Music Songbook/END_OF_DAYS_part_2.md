<span class="depth-10">The second of my trinity</span>
<span class="depth-10">The middle of the moth</span>
<span class="depth-10">The moss that rolls on, on, to three</span>
<span class="depth-10">To Frances - free one - finally - the last one two one of the flee</span>
<span class="depth-10">A helicopter (not a plane) overhead</span>
<span class="depth-10">Looking forward at the veins of that virgin creeper</span>
<span class="depth-10">And the bedroom window of the woman I had dreamed of murdering me</span>
<span class="depth-10">I see the ping pong bats now battened in their little hatches</span>
<span class="depth-10">Bending down, traversing this still-leaf-ridden hidden symbol-living given reads a centrepiece</span>
<span class="depth-10">The black queen, learned</span>
<span class="depth-10">Turned, in earnest or knot</span>
<span class="depth-10">To face the right, I write the not-so-wrongness</span>

<span class="depth-10">Knot</span>
<span class="depth-10">Shunning thoughts of darkness but allowing their eyes to see the gold garlanding self taught pupils of my own</span>
<span class="depth-10">I turn the queen</span>
<span class="depth-10">One hundred and eight marks of marring beads</span>
<span class="depth-10">Warming unwarning tea I brew</span>
<span class="depth-10">180 degrees, a reversal of the path of pilgrim Sun</span>
<span class="depth-10">Not thinking of the kings, neither light of white or blackened blue</span>
<span class="depth-10">I faced her crown still laying down, now left</span>
<span class="depth-10">And there I left the garden for the first time</span>
<span class="depth-10">Packing what was just not unpacked enough I struggle with the clasps</span>
<span class="depth-10">Of the hardy shell of suitcase</span>
<span class="depth-10">Waiting for my crowdfunding attempt at making rent to load on my browser then</span>
<span class="depth-10">Outside behind me a black Mercedes engine quivers like a Raven’s feather weathering its quietness around the river roundabout and I’m reminded</span>
<span class="depth-10">Don’t look back</span>
<span class="depth-10">Again</span>
<span class="depth-10">Seeing in my absence of a turning to the turning of the once again black stuttering of this Mark of dark black not-matte Richness leaving as a mirror</span>
<span class="depth-10">Two magpies dancing, no need to use their wings</span>
<span class="depth-10">Around the front and back of a squirrel as if trying to provide a sense of ease for him</span>
<span class="depth-10">Their black and whiteness screaming either side of boba eyes and bushy tail</span>
<span class="depth-10">How I miss you</span>
<span class="depth-10">And I wander through the cracks of this eroding picnic bench again</span>
<span class="depth-10">Not the one beneath you, Adrian (I promised you that tearful stab of penultimation was my final greeting)</span>
<span class="depth-10">But the one right in front of these nine hellish gates</span>
<span class="depth-10">I ponder, wandering</span>
<span class="depth-10">This place should have a pond although I understand why it’s missing</span>
<span class="depth-10">Are you missing me?</span>
<span class="depth-10">One message I received from you for the entirety of my stay, or leave</span>
<span class="depth-10">Asking for consent</span>
<span class="depth-10">You sent a message</span>
<span class="depth-10">What a mess</span>
<span class="depth-10">And how I’ve aged into a shrinking oldness</span>
<span class="depth-10">You</span>
<span class="depth-10">Us three</span>
<span class="depth-10">Back then (my goddess, how it seems a previous carnation wilted bookshelf of unlived life again)</span>
<span class="depth-10">This whole thing has just been poetry</span>
<span class="depth-10">Quite funny, really, in its tragedy</span>
<span class="depth-10">Thinking, as is much the case of late, of etymology</span>
<span class="depth-10">Like a healthy distant way to process what you meant</span>
<span class="depth-10">And what that meant</span>
<span class="depth-10">That usage of your leg as severing implement</span>
<span class="depth-10">And then, as if a nail in coughing nurse hid ‘hind a mask of black with pepperminted scent from oil she told us helped her remedy her allergies to dust and soil and seeking seeds of pollen</span>
<span class="depth-10">Thinking of the final meeting with Dr Shanahan, where I’d said</span>
<span class="depth-10">My little thoughts on the biggest book I’ve ever read</span>
<span class="depth-10">How death should be considered as a widow or a long forgotten friend with will</span>
<span class="depth-10">And then just now and then and now I thought of JK Rowling</span>
<span class="depth-10">And any of the women who create as clouds of reigning over my hopeful extinction</span>
<span class="depth-10">How through different believing, such sparring sparrows speaking difference</span>
<span class="depth-10">Same tongue, same place. Same soul, voice/face</span>
<span class="depth-10">A fucking plastic bag flies in a ring</span>
<span class="depth-11">-like flight path right before me</span>
<span class="depth-11">American-English-Rose-And-Falling artificial beautiful and carried by the northern wind come down to south to see whether people might perceive it</span>
<span class="depth-11">But still, it’s just the absence of the stillness we receive</span>
<span class="depth-11">Not wind itself’s expression but impressions that it leaves</span>
<span class="depth-11">Upon the fallen leaves</span>
<span class="depth-11">And leaving, like a sulking child bestows the bag an open grave</span>
<span class="depth-11">No dignity or grace or urn for its returning to the wave</span>
<span class="depth-11">I try to open that once first lasting poem I still know by heart but wanted to be sure of my retelling of this memory but neither google chrome nor Adam’s eave dropped Lilith Apple timecrunching browsing roused safari seemed to load the words as I pressed the so oft pressured by my now-clean left indexing finger so I went outside to breathe</span>
<span class="depth-11">But upon my returning the moriae had decided now, it was the time to share this little piece of childhood with this woman whose opinion of me I still was so unsure</span>
<span class="depth-11">I tentatively take off aegis headphones leaving my clipped on shades (which had bent but fixed my self two hours prior) secure</span>
<span class="depth-11">And say to her</span>
<span class="depth-11">I’m sorry for interrupting your break,</span>
<span class="depth-11">But your name-</span>
<span class="depth-11">It’s been reminding me of this poem from the poems on the Underground, a collection of my very first beloved words during a much much younger visit to the Big Smoke (way before</span>
<span class="depth-11">I’d come to smallness of my own smoke-choking raw)</span>
<span class="depth-11">Could i share it with you? It’s title seems to be a sign that Now is right -</span>
<span class="depth-11">I still do not know if she had been perturbed by my playing the piano in the chapel, but with my leaving imminent it didn’t matter, shaking me, she said:</span>
<span class="depth-11">“Oh darling, sure”</span>
<span class="depth-11">￼</span>
<span class="depth-11">Sitting down in seventeen</span>
<span class="depth-11">I’ve written notes to mostly everyone</span>
<span class="depth-11">Now’s the time to sing</span>
<span class="depth-11">I stuck together two of the verdant cards cut into shapes of leaves</span>
<span class="depth-11">I wonder if this homonymous morphology was purposeful and there in that much trodden corridor I thought “it is, I will just choose to believe”</span>
<span class="depth-11">Be leave</span>
<span class="depth-11">And in the goddess of the spine, the knot-yet peeling-glue to hold together, healing, hurting everything</span>
<span class="depth-11">I stuck a sticker of my past and now passed merchandising</span>
<span class="depth-11">My visage of Arachne, my darkness debutante eight legged thing</span>
<span class="depth-11">Walking down the hall I’d come to not-knot-rot-now-know, a child again, I was flapping that little despair dissipating air-craft avian facsimile</span>
<span class="depth-11">Waving it pretending it really was like me, a bird</span>
<span class="depth-11">Just longing to be flying somewhere smelt and breathed like home to me</span>
<span class="depth-11">Nobody passed me as I made this infantile free gesture</span>
<span class="depth-11">Smiling at the silly thing I’d made, I farewell blessed her</span>
<span class="depth-11">And searching for a glue-dot or quiet tape we weren’t a loud here</span>
<span class="depth-11">The HCA suggested I use a sticky label for refrigerated foodstuffs stuffed and stacked and packed into the frigid-left-right-centre</span>
<span class="depth-11">So wrapping it around itself and thinking of a nest or heart or any imperfection of suggestion of a circle</span>
<span class="depth-11">Cross-sectioned vivisected into infinite dimensions, making stone from sticky hollowness of little symbol cylinder</span>
<span class="depth-11">I placed her in the middle, like a sparrow now to exit</span>
<span class="depth-11">And I think there was it</span>
<span class="depth-11">When I decided in my Own Way, I had covered, reckoned with</span>
<span class="depth-11">Tentative remembrance of recovery or whatever wellsprung meaning any place like this could give</span>
<span class="depth-11">Arachne's silk - thread - weave - whirling devilish and dervishly - sing melodies- aria - DNA - Ariadne's thread, red</span>
<span class="depth-12">- labyrinthine sign to exit - read - book - spinal syrinx like a clarinet reed - basket encased by the reeds - river flows through to leaves once stuck - now freed - together - leaves - leaving with a load too heavy - but there inside a light - now out lit behind sight - don't look back - lot's black widow turning into a - salt - battery - charge - for - telephonic - phoenix - messaging - a beacon - ward - 'goodbye messages to the ward' - guard - garden wing - a bird - a beak - that chirps - that sings - that comes back home cold and older but within the tangled mess - still buttressed - buttered toast for dinner - thinner - strung out - stitched with symbols deep within - the word is everything - the script, the scripture, halved to whole - holes of the holy text - textile - swaddled by ancestral warmth of living and departed coven - woven tapestry - gold weight led to alchemy - delicate but strong, a spun return to Selfhood, red</span>
<span class="depth-13">riddle of forgotten gift - no lift but lifted - ascent - a sending way back home to Arachne</span>
<span class="depth-13">And on the upturned symbols of the mulching season (two, I picked up two for such a reason)</span>
<span class="depth-13">I wrote that most verbose but much too short (like life) quote by T S Eliot</span>
<span class="depth-13"></span>
<span class="depth-13">And hoped that in my hurt returning I had learned enough to know the place</span>
<span class="depth-13">Why are we so quick to pathologise pain?</span>
<span class="depth-13">Pleasure I’m sure is a screaming of warning of endings verse grief’s evil reversal to which as a closing pulse dance partner bowing we allow in sow piglet to pork to forked path wrath unasked for and reeling from which we should equally just as much but don’t refrain;</span>
<span class="depth-13">Try to separate difference, you’ll find you cannot, like a Damocles blade cannot rain</span>
<span class="depth-13">though it seems so dendritic, it’s all just the same-</span>
<span class="depth-13">The face of voiceless echoing of almost-burning down up from lacing of the broken sole-cloven shoes I cannot use that cleaning staff will find while I trace lines of all my fallen left waiting</span>
<span class="depth-13">Weighting north to find me</span>
<span class="depth-13">Not behind me at all</span>
<span class="depth-13">But calling forth, a bridge</span>
<span class="depth-13">A biting, rung-writ midge</span>
<span class="depth-13">Wrung-tight written little</span>
<span class="depth-13">Landing just then on my right wrist</span>
<span class="depth-13">Just whispering so gently in suggestion to open my fist</span>
<span class="depth-13">So I obey her, and away she flutters</span>
<span class="depth-13">Ending this synchronous tryst</span>
<span class="depth-13">About to leave for the 1:1 with Frances (nearly free now) I leave an apple on my fresh-made bed</span>
<span class="depth-13">Red</span>
<span class="depth-14"></span>
<span class="depth-14">And close, so very almost close (only closest I could find, mind) to circular, ovarian ring</span>
<span class="depth-15"></span>
<span class="depth-15">Over</span>
<span class="depth-15">Under</span>
<span class="depth-15">Circling</span>
<span class="depth-15">Parallelogrammar hurtling through</span>
<span class="depth-15">And through the useless queen and king</span>
<span class="depth-15">Sarah, knocking just before I enter my bathroom about to pee I zip my fly (egads, gladly, gadfly, flea)</span>
<span class="depth-15">She asks if I need my stuff from out of my locker and offers to get it for me</span>
<span class="depth-15">I say, calmness washing over me</span>
<span class="depth-15">I can see in the depth of her eyes, like those three, darting sense of shared relief</span>
<span class="depth-15">I say no, you get home and rest and I’ll get my things after therapy</span>
<span class="depth-15">She shakes my hand and says please</span>
<span class="depth-15">Look after yourself, you’re very special</span>
<span class="depth-15">I say</span>
<span class="depth-15">Mirror</span>
<span class="depth-15">Hold my hand up, smiling</span>
<span class="depth-15">She says mirror back, while flipping her palm round as if a secret bookshelf entrance behind which lie tales too gory but still poured over by my letter-hungry eyes while I was still so small</span>
<span class="depth-15">And then my final words to her (I think, for just a second which resounds out through all these hallowed halls - of both our deaths)</span>
<span class="depth-15">Mirror mirror on the wall</span>
<span class="depth-15">And she laughed, I think it shimmered in sincerity</span>
<span class="depth-15">We spoke of TS as in Transsexual and as in T.S. Eliot</span>

<span class="depth-16"></span>
<span class="depth-16">These non-delusional frameworks of reference I gave to Frances in our such bittersweet parting</span>
<span class="depth-16">The final echo of our voices and our faces saying</span>
<span class="depth-16">Ciao</span>
<span class="depth-16">(The dualistic meaning of witch I’m sure you don’t need me to reiterate now)</span>
<span class="depth-16">I tell her</span>
<span class="depth-16">I think maybe all this interstitial tissue of intermittent quietude and blighting with was ritual teaching me to be a teacher</span>
<span class="depth-16">And that angel on top of the library</span>
<span class="depth-16">Who stared and stairs into me spiralling my memories back into yarn</span>
<span class="depth-16">This was a</span>
<span class="depth-16">Pilgrimage</span>
<span class="depth-16">My lonely hajj</span>
<span class="depth-16">Out, out into the opener air</span>
<span class="depth-16">I see some acquaintances I’d met at the picnic bench in passing</span>
<span class="depth-16">Mewing their sympathetic tones of Oh! You Are Going?</span>
<span class="depth-16">And, as if possessed by a future self I never thought could be but one told would emerge eventually</span>
<span class="depth-16">I asserted boundaries</span>
<span class="depth-16">This unkempt Fire saying “Yes, but I hate goodbyes, and all these things I have to carry just so heavy, so I’m just going to stay over here”</span>
<span class="depth-16">And whether they were offended or respected this (to me) impressively (maybe selfish, oh well) gesture, their responses I just did not hear</span>

<span class="depth-16">Like a dog, laying itself to rest, checking to make sure</span>
<span class="depth-16">It wasn’t crushing any insects</span>
<span class="depth-16">As an ascetic, a monk, or particularly manic monkey (though the planar movement rotated right-angled by approximately ninety degrees  </span>
