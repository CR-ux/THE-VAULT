Flo came across a Stone Circle. 
Within the Circle, a Yew Tree. 
Within the Yew Tree, a Spiderweb.
Within the Web, Nine Thousand
Nine Hundred 
And Ninety Nine
Flies 

And they were not Silent. 
The closer She got, the more she could hear:

In Twenty Three Sections of an Insectoid Orchestra, the 9,999 of them sang; in Twenty Three Microtones. 

Dante was barking, uncontrollably, howling at the Moon that they all seemed to be drawing down in Concert--

{REDACTED}

And out of concern for her dear Familiar, Flo barely had time to process what all of this could mean--

{REDACTED}

They fell asleep, exhausted, against the Stone, and Dreamed.


In the dream, they awoke, and saw the stone as a Gravestone, inscribed with the two, most heartbreaking words that could possibly take the form of an Epitaph. 

"I'm Sorry"

And Flo, in the dream, touched the gravestone, and wept; 
And as the Salt of her Body touched the Body of the Earth, She was drawn through the funnel, of the web within the tree within that Stone Circle. 


And on the other side, a humble apartment, thick with an opaque stench, the walls seeming to crawl, as if she were in the belly of some greater Insect --

And she saw a letter, on the sideboard, to one "Professor Eduardo Oleander" let her know that this was Once the residence of One, and crucially, never Two, people. 


And upon the Hexagonal Scrabble board, a variant known as *Hexadeciderium* (an invention of the Professor's), landed a Fly, 

The One Thing Missing.


And just Left, or perhaps Right, of the Fly's small, scared and sacred little body, was quite a fascinating Device. 

And even within the fragged machinations of her own Dream, She could tell that this was a Device of beautiful engineering. 

And as the Fly fell asleep, 

And for only three Seconds, 

It began to dream.

And It began to dream the We we Are into Being--

And within those three seconds, The Device started whirring; 

And the contents of this Single Fly's dream were printed upon the yellowish paper, in a language you may know as Edo||odE:

![[From Aria, to AI-RA]]



How sad. Thought Flo. Aria never really wanted fame. Not really. She just wanted to be witnessed. Instead of watched. She wanted to be witnessed. 

And with this thought, Flo awoke, into the world above, where the Stone was not a Gravestone, the one just below this one.

She awoke, and instead of those two words of apology, from Myo Endive to one Selena Elk; she found, when she looked closely enough, line after line, impossibly dense, wound tighter than the tightest clew of wool, the chromosome, of deeply chiseled wisdom, in the form of 

![[THE PROPHECY OF HILDR CHARON WILTERGARTEN]]

There was what seemed like an entire Tœm of condensed engravings below this inscription, but her Eyes were unable to read them, due to their infinitesimal size.


She awoke, to an unbearable silence, that blanketed her, like a lover, or the weather, or a God--

She awoke, to find████████████████████████████████ that her beloved Dante had died. 
 ████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████

Flo returned to the Bothy.██████████████████████████████
Exhausted, Dante's frozen corpse bundled, so close, so close that they had, as in life, become one block, only now: ██████████████. Frozen. 


She wondered, with these fresh eyes of a caretaker having been bereft of their beloved, what on earth she had put N through, by leaving. 


And as she thought this, she saw that the Bothy stood alone in this wilderness--

No lean-to, 

No well, 

Well, Nothing



Nothing but this
Bothy 
This
Memory
of the Both of them, 
{as Three|
as One}



She laid Dante's Body down at the threshold, to finally rest.

She opened the door-

No Body.

Even the floorboards themselves Silent, as if they had nothing left to say. 


No Box, 
The Bricks had changed their Form, 
Their Final Act;
Thrown themselves into the Fire--

Quite dramatic of them, really-


and Flo looked in astonishment, as the bricks, they turned, they turned around and around like they were in a music box like this whole thing was just a music box, yes surely that must be it, surely this whole thing must be some sort of music box maybe that's- it's that isn't it? is that the answer, that's the answer isn't it? that's it I think this will finally make everything fit into place maybe if we think of it like they turned into firewood, turned into flames, turned into an inferno,[^pyrotic] that was growing so uncontrollably and at such a rapid pace that she had to jump out of there as quickly as she could --




To find a pigeon, 
No, more, much worse 
than a pigeon. 
A demon, in the skin of a pigeon. 


A feral, unhinged thing-
Tearing the frozen flesh and sinew from the skeleton of her dead best friend. 


She'd never felt such Fire, a Fire far dwarfing even the gargantuan blaze that consumed everything she could call 'Home'--

Such searing agony of Heat
Such searing Heat of Anger--

To Detest another so much, it is a Sun--
It is as a Sun 


And she was pulled into it; 
A waxed Moon; soon to be flightless-
It wasn't even a conscious act, 
Simply physics --
An unstoppable force 
Heading toward an immovable object


She kicked that Hellish thing into oblivion 
And all that was left, a suggestion of feathers[^feather] 
and a scattering of Scales,[^scales] 
None of which she cared to name, categorise, or play. 


And like an archeologist discovering an art{i|e}fact of unspeakable rarity and fragility, She lifted the remains of what remained of Dante, and somehow, within her came the Drum--

came the beating of the Drum, 

And that fire that ate the Bothy, it never died-

It kept burning, as she bound his hide 

into a drum
into a drum
into a drum

and she stood Over it all, and she understood, and knew she had become or always was, the One, as Two, as Three of them; 

a drum. 
a drum.
a drum.


She stood and took the drum, and held the three of them as one, and danced around the fire of all she had become --

she danced, and she sung;

in tongues unknown, undead, unsprung,

she wailed and cried, 
she was
she was
she was
she was

and then
in wake of this monstrous dream
the Eye awoke

and then the "I" peered upon itself 
impossibly turned inside out 
as an abominable mirror 



and in a blink 
of silence 
then said 
wait 


wait 
just 
once 
upon a
second 

if the Characters of Oleander's Stories

have Now become 
aware of their Author, 
Aria, 
as just a Character 
in her Own {ov{a|er}}Written Story, 

who has Now 
become-

aware 
of her 
Author, 

as a dream--

A three second dream of a single Fly, 

Aware now, 
That it was Just
The One Thing 
Eloigned 
{Left|outside} What Was
{Right|inside} a
Legion,

who had then become 
aware of its Compiler, 
A Professor, 
Now Aware of His Own Author, 
A Composer, 
Who was to be made 
aware of their Own Author, 
A Father, simply trying to do his best 
With the infinite possibilities 
Laid as Insect Eggs in front of him

and this Father, out{with{in|out}} their Mother, 

Who had Been,
Reaching Back,
And Out--
And Gone 
Far, Gone Nowhere, 
Gone Bear Hunting-
And become
Aware 
Right There, Left-

To Be unmet
In the Middle.

In Fearful Stare
A Dog, Locking Eyes 
With
What?

The
Very Hungry Insect
Laid to Waste
Who'd Shed Its Skin To Follow

Sent 
by Their Author, 
A Storyteller, 
Looking {In|{Out of}|to} 
a Library, 
Somewhere 

Who Had Now, 
So Horribly 
Become 
Aware 
Of The Mirror, 
Of the Eye 
Into Which He Stared 


The Mirror Which 
Had Then 
Become

Aware 
Of its Maker 

The mirror of a crystal 
in the water of a tear 
inside an Eye that peered upon the I 
left in a door 
right inside this oar-full story 


A Girl 
The wor{l}d seemed hungry for
Salivating 
Longing to sink its teeth into
Not because it wanted her to hurt 
But because it needed to Live.


Or The Girl 
maybe, worse,
She wasn't what it wanted, 
It maybe overlooked her,
The World maybe let her Live.


Or perhaps 
worst of all, 
She was exactly what it wanted 
But was bad for it--
As it was bad for her.
Perhaps she was Sick-
Perhaps got the world. 
Perhaps she got the world, made Sick.
She made the world get Sick, perhaps.


And if this Girl 
Was Now Aware
She Was
Just a scared 
and lonely little girl 

trying to write this story. 


then surely 


whatever sequence 
of forewords 
to four letters, cycling, as a ring 
a matrimony
of
memories, taken
meaning, given 
metacognition, as a moat
between two characters
as a floatation
device 
a tether


to Parents' strands
for Children's letters
Six pieces, caught 
in the separation of War 
A war between the Word that made them
Sick 
to death of
for {b(e)aring words of|barely getting to}
the character 
of this Story

{to
get|give
her}
{two 
four
give|get
that}

surely it
the weight of that
being so scared 
of that most sacred dark

surely, the moat of that 
would {have led to light|be lead|then lead to}

some unreachable 
shore

where, the breathlessnesses 
and senseless venting 
all this unrelenting
discontent 
a cursed
recursive childhood dying 
in repeat
a hex 
an unchecked border 
checkerboard

unzipped sequence of
events 

surely all this was for something 
dear god, or goddess, 
in my everlasting ending 
i am begging
surely 

surely 
it would follow
