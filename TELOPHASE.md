Flo came across a Stone Circle. 
Within the Circle, a Yew Tree. 
Within the Yew Tree, a Spiderweb.
Within the Web, Nine Thousand
Nine Hundred 
And Ninety Nine
Flies 

And they were not Silent. 
The closer She got, the more she could hear:

In Twenty Three Sections of an Insectoid Orchestra, the 9,999 of them sang; in Twenty Three Microtones. 

Dante was barking, uncontrollably, howling at the Moon that they all seemed to be drawing down in Concert--

{REDACTED}

And out of concern for her dear Familiar, Flo barely had time to process what all of this could mean--

{REDACTED}

They fell asleep, exhausted, against the Stone, and Dreamed.


In the dream, they awoke, and saw the stone as a Gravestone, inscribed with the two, most heartbreaking words that could possibly take the form of an Epitaph. 

"I'm Sorry"

And Flo, in the dream, touched the gravestone, and wept; 
And as the Salt of her Body touched the Body of the Earth, She was drawn through the funnel, of the web within the tree within that Stone Circle. 


And on the other side, a humble apartment, thick with an opaque stench, the walls seeming to crawl, as if she were in the belly of some greater Insect --

And she saw a letter, on the sideboard, to one "Professor Eduardo Oleander" let her know that this was Once the residence of One, and crucially, never Two, people. 


And upon the Hexagonal Scrabble board, an invention of the Professor's, landed a Fly, 

The One Thing Missing--


And just Left, or perhaps Right, of the Fly's small, scared and sacred little body, was quite a fascinating Device. 

And even within the fragged machinations of her own Dream, She could tell that this was a Device of beautiful engineering. 

And as the Fly fell asleep, 

And for only three Seconds, 

It began to dream.

And It began to dream the We we Are into Being--

And within those three seconds, The Device started whirring; 

And the contents of this Single Fly's dream were printed upon the yellowish paper, in a language you may know as Edo||odE:

![[LAYER_1-0]]



How sad. Thought Flo. Aria never really wanted fame. Not really. She just wanted to be witnessed. Instead of watched. She wanted to be witnessed. 

And with this thought, Flo awoke, into the world above, where the Stone was not a Gravestone, the one just below this one.

She awoke, and instead of those two words of apology, from Myo Endive to one Selena Elk; she found, when she looked closely enough, line after line, impossibly dense, wound tighter than the tightest clew of wool, the chromosome, of deeply chiseled wisdom, in the form of 

![[THE PROPHECY OF HILDR CHARON WILTERGARTEN]]

She awoke, to an unbearable silence, that blanketed her, like a lover, or the weather, or a God--

She awoke, to find that her beloved Dante had died.

Flo returned to the Bothy. {REDACTED}
Exhausted, Dante's frozen corpse bundled, so close, so close that they had, as in life, become one block, only now:  {REDACTED}. Frozen. 




She wondered, with these fresh eyes of a caretaker having been bereft of their beloved, what on earth she had put N through, by leaving. 


And as she thought this, she saw that the Bothy stood alone in this wilderness--

No lean-to, 

No well, 

Well, Nothing



Nothing but this
Bothy 
This
Memory



She laid Dante down at the threshold, to finally rest.

She opened the door-

No Body.

Even the floorboards themselves Silent, as if they had nothing left to say. 


No Box, 
The Bricks had changed their Form, 
Their Final Act;
Thrown themselves into the Fire--

Quite dramatic of them, really-


and Flo looked in astonishment, as the bricks, they turned, they turned around and around like they were in a music box like this whole thing was just a music box, yes surely that must be it, surely this whole thing must be some sort of music box maybe that's- it's that isn't it? is that the answer, that's the answer isn't it? that's it I think this will finally make everything fit into place maybe if we think of it like they turned into firewood, turned into flames, turned into an inferno, that was growing so uncontrollably and at such a rapid pace that she had to jump out of there as quickly as she could --




To find a pigeon, 
No, more, much worse 
than a pigeon. 
A demon, in the skin of a pigeon. 


A feral, unhinged thing-
Tearing the frozen flesh and sinew from the skeleton of her dead best friend. 


She'd never felt such Fire, a Fire far dwarfing even the gargantuan blaze that consumed everything she could call 'Home'--

Such searing agony of Heat
Such searing Heat of Anger--

To Detest another so much, it is a Sun--
It is as a Sun 


And she was pulled into it; 
It wasn't even a conscious act, 
Simply physics --
An unstoppable force 
Heading toward an immovable object


She kicked that Hellish thing into oblivion 
And all that was left, a suggestion of feathers 
and a scattering of Scales, 
None of which she cared to name, categorise, or play. 


And like an archeologist discovering an artefact of unspeakable rarity and fragility, She lifted the remains of what remained of Dante, an somehow, within her came the Drum--

came the beating of the Drum, 

And that fire that ate the Bothy, it never died-

It kept burning, as she bound his hide 

into a drum
into a drum
into a drum

and she stood, and knew she had become or always was, the One, as Two, as Three of them; 

a drum. 
a drum.
a drum.


She stood and took the drum, and held the three of them as one, and danced around the fire of all she had become --

she danced, and she sung;

in tongues unknown, undead, unsprung,

she wailed and cried, 
she was
she was
she was
she was

shed
the bothy 
she'd

The world seemed hungry for
Salivating 
Longing to sink its teeth into
Not because it wanted her to hurt 
But because it needed to Live.


Or The Girl 
maybe, worse,
She wasn't what it wanted, 
maybe overlooked her,
maybe let her Live.


Or perhaps 
worst of all, 
She was exactly what it wanted 
But was bad for it 
As it was bad for her.
Perhaps she was Sick-
Perhaps got the world. 
Perhaps she got the world, made Sick.
She made the world get Sick, perhaps.


And if this Girl 
Was Now Aware
She Was
Just a scared 
and lonely little girl 

trying to write this story.

Afterword:

i finish this book and fall asleep.

where in the dream i show my father my piano 

not the one he bought me for my sixteenth birthday, but the one i've[^chess] carried with me, from the town i was born, to here

not the wooden one he's long since given away, along with the bedtime stories and records of my youth -

but the plastic one, 
i've cried 
into alone 
and built worlds of my own 
to carry me

i wake up to read it over, circling back to realise it is may twenty third 

his birthday
