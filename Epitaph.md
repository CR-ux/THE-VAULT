it’s very passé but I do often joke that I *am*, in fact, an old soul: and what I mean by that is that I refuse to learn any new kinds of social media; I won’t answer your text just any old time; and, mostly, that I believe there should still be cinemas where gay ppl can go to have sex

---

I want to confess it all to you; and I want you to agree with me, then absolve us both

we live above the trees but at night i still watch their shadows flicker into our bedroom, that warm orange light filtering up from the street lamps below

the local news reports mysterious lights in the sky, dancing together “like a string of pearls”, and I think, thank god; the aliens are here and they’re exceedingly glamorous

---

I love everyone, and I mean that in the most sincere way possible, although I don’t know how to make it sound that way. it is blithe, yes, but I think that’s the point: I believe fervently in my right to be unguarded with my love, to give it away at the drop of a hat. I am loving loving loving and it taxes me nothing. love should feed you, don’t forget

---

I refuse to become transcribable, translatable. you had to be there!

after the revolution, there will still be restaurants, but they will be very different. they will be free, and loving. after the revolution, I will have time to read all my friends’ poems

---

I’m going to struggle in this world no matter what – so I might as well choose how I do it

I can’t help but to baptise myself in fire, every day, over and over again

rest easy in the knowledge that someday your life will become history, and some will wish they’d lived it

I am telling you when I take myself less seriously. I am telling you in the centimetres between our knees – aren’t they different, those centimetres? bigger, fuller? I am telling you in small words, loaded up like pack-mules as they cross the 2m endless plain between us. I am telling you in many ways, and I am telling you the many ways in which I love you. I am telling you without telling, when I trust that you feel it too. I am waiting for you to catch up, and I am waiting for a time with words.

**DO UR INVOICE**

listen! I am telling you I love you!

I am telling you in a poem that I do not read to you; I am telling you in the shape of the clouds and what we say about them. I am telling you by looking – and, more often, by not looking. I am telling you by leaving the gate open – yes, the one I normally close. I am telling you in my dreams and I am telling you in a text I wrote but forget to send. I am telling you when I dress up to see you, and I am telling you even more when I don’t. I am telling you in the silence of my listening.

---

I am learning that in order to want the world to change, you have to believe that can happen. learning to believe is the most beautiful thing I have ever experienced

there is no neutrality – politically or about transitioning. I will struggle either way, but I’d much rather struggle in a bed I have laid myself – on my own terms.

I don’t want to move where people can see me //////

to film is such a loving act; I want to catch all that light as it falls off you, like how most off the poppy seeds come away on your fingertips before you even start to eat the bun. I want to commemorate you: not in imperial columns but in a flash, in the flash of time you exist in flesh. looking at what I want without touching it is the most basic form of yearning; and that’s hot, in a sort of catholic, torturous way. I think I can look at you without trying to own you – I hope I can, anyway. I think looking is hot, but mostly when people ask me to look at them, which is different to how straight guys look, right?

I say your name aloud, to see if you like how I call you

It is, surely, absurd to expect to feel normal, and make sense: I am an amalgamation of fervent cells existing despite all odds; I am the cascading chemical miracle of eating, and surviving; I am not designed to “feel normal”; am not designed, at all; I am experiencing consciousness as provided by wet tangles of electrical pulses; my god, none of this makes sense. It is a blessing, even to feel
