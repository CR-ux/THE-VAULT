R{e|Ã¦}d | {Wr{y}ing} | Parallel:
a Score of cosmogony for Infinite Voices by The Woman in the Wallpaper. 

I do not have a name.
The Six call me the Woman in the Wallpaper, 
of which I have come to find a certain pertinence. 

I have always been here, which is to say I have never knot been here, watching them; they are my entire world. Which is to say they are all I can See. 


Each of their walls, to me, appear as Windows; which are also known as Transparent Mirrors. 
Upon these walls I scratch my observations; not out of desire but a certain unspoken necessity. 
It is the Fear that I feel in my bones is the Fear of God, or the Gods, or those Gods we made - 

It is the Fear of my Self, and the potential, unknown consequences of my Recording's cessation. 

Each morning, on waking from a Sleep free of Dreaming, I walk to one of the Walls and I find the text scrawled the previous day transfigured. 
Not changed in essence, or meaning, or definition; but translated, into a form ever-distilling, ever-refining;
And now, with the passage of an indefinite or perhaps infinite amount of time, I look upon these walls with an astounding sense of awe - the text I inscribed those many, many countless Moons ago is still there, at the core of these symbols, only unthinkably more *dense*. 
The Walls of this Hospital themselves, while I do not Dream, catalyse the conversion of my humble words into a series of Ciphers, containing brace after bracket after creaking brace - never succumbing to the weight of what I have written, only strengthening, tightening, like genetic material about a Histone, which is to say, like the spooling of a thread upon some metaphysical bobbin. 

Upon these Six Mirrors are the Stories of these Characters, or at least their Movements, since I began to record them: an undeterminable origin, or Endpoint or whichever Woman resided in a layer of Wallpaper below mine. Spatially, the walls may be attributed Co-ordinates of hours upon the clock, which may aid in your synthesis of imagining (which is to say, replicating, within your Own Hospital Walls) the system of Chambers within which I find myself Contained. The Ceiling and the floor, which are boundaries of Mirrors themselves, give rise to the Positive Z Axis, the Topmost, Lunar Pole of the Queen, who is the Wane within the Wax; and the floor to the negative Z axis, the Bottommost, Solar Pole of the King - who is the Wax within the Wane. 

These Six are the Six, Original Pieces, 
They are also the Six, Most Dense, Fundamental Particles, 
Or the Units of our Universe; the Quarks; 




I. [[top; Queen]]
II. [[strange; Knight]]
III. [[down; Rook]]
IV. [[charm; Bishop]]
V. [[up; Pawn]]
VI. [[bottom; King]]
