I Am

Thinking of Nisha Ramayya. She is quickly becoming one of my heroes. 
She is now based in Glasgow and has all of the academia relating to Literature that I almost obtained in biological sciences (I did three years of a PhD in virology / bioinformatics at the {redacted} institute before the pandemic hit and made me realise I need to come out {as trans} and follow my {art|hearedacted} 
Then came survival redacted , the first abyss of the heroins journey 
Then came{re}d{a}cted} , the {red{acted}} debut chronicle of this heretofore {most|harrowing} life experience 
Then I tried and tried and tried to make it work 
Performing , creating art as ritual , breaking my body to express or attempt to impress the ineffable 
And while I achieved my goal of pressing a vinyl (300, the very vast majority of which still lie unsold under my bed) 

It never really worked 

I had to become a software developer with redacted 
Which gave me the empirical means to have three of the gender affirming {redacted} I so needed
Accenting  the pendulous journey
South - Physicality 
(“Coventry and Warwick”  named hospital the clinical place of my birth and Coventry the city and then warwick university, my undergrad degree )
To North - spirituality - upward to Scottish roots of my heritage calling me , first thought for my PhD (genetics and finding cure for dis-ease) 
Back to south of the body (redacted work, London acting job to try to make such mean ends meet, and the virtual site of the interview and HQ for this largest most money-oriented-un-orient company) back to North to redacted - growing rose  of the crown of thorns ex-partner marked den to the tens of the gods who redacted me , back to south of the mind and the land , down to London , when the redacted redacted for my mental casing complexity just flat out refused in their fruitless per-suiting to take me , so down I went in descent once again to that place, surely capitalising my mercurial red ringed fate , and there, where an unplayed pianoredactedas closed behind an impassable gate - of transphobic unconscious hatred of my name - redacted - redacted - of voice - and of face - facing up to the truth as a gadfly remains - so I turned to 
Red Acted
Building worlds with 
The word 
Architecting my world or a boundary or plate 
Fixed-Fire
Bound-Arie
On which to feed muscles redacted oysters of pearls of seamen around all the boys redacted girls redacted between ones  that ;redacted debt cud err; detca decked 'er' 'eid' red read all red alert learnt her unearlier girt hurt me and that dirt I trailed in through my self-hating ring sin growing grin thin chin chipped drill stitched and swollen going in I allowed in to hurt me 
The worlds of words are pouring out of me the more I dance in ceremony and it’s much more exponentially potent ‘neath the breathing archaic ancient rhythm of trees 

They are whispering to me 
And I can’t stop speaking communing or writing in verse 

I don’t know how to syncretise this worlds within worlds to a wheel not a cage but a framework to redacted not for sake of me but for sake of them for sake that I know though it feels god hath forsaken me I am being reeled like a tape spool or thread from a womb of entombing cocooning cruelty to the trees to the trees to the zephyr which breathes ancient words through the leaves that return to the earth in their sighing relief
