**FOREWORD.**

The Universe[^uni] is comprised of a system of infinitely contiguous rooms, housing one patient each. 
What follows is the spiral staircase that runs directly down the centre of said hospital. 
When viewed from above (which is also below, with abundant enough, or sufficiently few, perspectival dimensions[^2]), this staircase resembles a Circular book with a circular spine, with no end, or beginning, [[Only One, Infinitely Repeating Story]]. 
This Circle is the infinitely dense centre point of this hexagonal fractal. 
# Chronography

[^2]: From a certain Two Dimensional perspective, a Cube[^c] may resemble a Hexagon.
[^c]: From a certain Three Dimensional persective, a Hexagon may resemble a Cube.[^i]
[^i]: if At All possible, try to imagine this Three Dimensional Object as the Centrepoint of a Four Dimensional[^4] cross section, which we shall term 'X'.[^x]
[^x]: Now, if At All possible, try to imagine an infinite[^i] number of 'spokes', Emanating in each possible direction, from this Centrepoint. 
[^4]: For the purposes of this thought experiment, the Fourth Dimension is a catch-all term, referring to any dimension additional to the Third. This may be (but does not have to be) Time. It could also refer to more (or less) concrete parameters.[^p]
[^p]: Such as the progression of a Story; made of infinitely many Characters, or Patients, within this infinite[^i] hospital.
[^i]: While infinite protrusions may be an impossible visage to imagine, the concept of endlessness[^edge] may be. So, if at all possible, try to imagine an endless array of Spokes from this central Three Dimensional point, emanating through an infinite number of Fourth Dimensions, into a Four Dimensional Hyperhexagon, which, when imagined through our (limited, but perhaps sufficient) cognition as a Three Dimensional 'net'[^net], has so many 'Faces' as to appear 'smooth' as a Four Dimensional Circle, or Hypersphere.[^3]
[^3]: This Hypersphere is a recursive repeat of the Circular Book, or Spiral Staircase, or DNA molecule, at the centre of Our Library, which is[^uni] also the outmost border, {separating us from|connecting us to} the Unspeakably Unknowable Void[^g]
