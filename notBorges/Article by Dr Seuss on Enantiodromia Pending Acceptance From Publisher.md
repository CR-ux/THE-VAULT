Perhaps once a protective form of sociological containment to ensure bonds between constituent members of a stratum, for the purposes of preventing the interaction with an external threat (be it outwithintra-species, (in(out in)without group) or inwithouter-species (out(in, out)within group) in nature) but, through the iterative passage of a series of self-propagating events perceived subjectively as temporally linear, and the enantiodromic evolution of both human intelligence and ignorance, continues to cause a disproportionate amount of harm until the real meaning of minerva fighting mars is found through their own vehicle be it an empty chariot with a lion's head door knocker that looks more like a sabre tooth tiger until you look at the same thing a little differently, or a train, or a plane, or a car, or a star, or the wind, or the trees, or through you, or through me, 
I do not like Myself{:/;} 'I am'. 
I do knot like *them*'s 'Am'{;/./,(Eye)?} 
>(I) am.
