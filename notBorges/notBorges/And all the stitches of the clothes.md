*[[Chess.]][^s]*


*And all the stitches of the clothes[^c]* 
*Holding remnants of your scent* 
*They’re picked* 
*And sniffed* 
*Until the dust comes clean* 
*Throw them away*
*I don’t want them* 
*Any more[^Am]* 

*[[THE END OF DAYS]]*

*Throw them away* 
*I can’t use them* 
*Anymore* 

*Throw them away* 
*I don’t need them* 
*Anymore*"
