permalink: BEGINNING TO END (AGAIN)
---
I am
Finding myself
Thinking about windows again
And screens again
And mirrors
Again
I am
Being myself
Being the window again
Membranous metaphor
Hot molten earth
Turned
transparency
I’m remembering again
Am I?
I am
Finding myself
Thinking again
Carrying water
and chopping down trees
Mycelium seeping
Whispering secrets
Of endings
through cracks
To begin
again
I am
But
We are
And never were to be
again
I am finding myself
Casting net curtains
to catch my own role 
A closed window
To an opening
Soul
I am
Yet
to find myself
Outside 
Crouched naked
under moonlight
Upright
and ululating
Downright
howling uglinesses at the night again
I am
Yet
I am not
What you
Find yourself
thinking
I am
That I
am
That I
were 
a Man
I would have often held his heart
In the darkness of the marketplace
The freshest meat 
Still reeks of flesh 
butcher clutching
expectantly 
Claw dripping in gristle, 
thudding chunks of bone to lug 
and creaking weighing scales again 
And
Through the soft
Often held
breath
of a window
I find myself
Being
again.


A life 
O The shimmering blindness
Of another little life
beginning;
Intoxicating -

As yet another handsome Ending 
Is caressing my hair 
bicep bulging as a lock is tucked 
and turned behind my ear
the Ending shifts his weight in finality 
across the bench
we have come to call our own
to steal a smile, popping spit bubbles 
formed in the corners of his lips
to lean 
into the crook of my neck 
to whisper down my death row throat
and gently tell me this:

"You Are  
your own great river
Your swallowed love 
like stepping stones”

Each greedy gulp a gateway
to the next 
Casting nets 
to catch your breath 
Each one
a quiet wave 
A reflection’s shudder
In a ripple of judgement
a life-rafted opportunity
To be seen
as a mirror"

Then in 
the spoiling swirls of love
Gripped at the ankle
By some forgotten weed
Nicked at the knee 
By the sharpest rocks 
the Men condensed 
and pressured themselves into
and I am dragged 
in my nakedness
skin burning, like a comet 
an uncontainable ether 
tethered to this wretched weight
a thinning shard of glass 
and a makeup brush
to shape a heaving block 
of granite 

And at the bottom
I plant my insignificant seeds
Letting rot my shameful garden
Upon the surface
Laying waste 
my raked and beaten heart

The dulling visage
Of all my endings;
Unbearable.

Unbearable calm 
Brutal 
Serenity a sin I wind myself into a ball within 
Delicate Tendrils of sinew to bind my mind to times I let disgusting men in 
Yet something tells me to begin 
Again 

Each return in turn is licked by the very first beginning 
The origin of the odyssey 
The deafening wail of the unflattering tale of a victim as a hero 

And yet 
And still 
Stillness is still here 
Where 
A quieter voice 
slowly reveals itself 
Unfurling amplitude in every part of my life 
My brain contains an open space of Hymn 
big strong hurt in a whittled little heart 
Again 
I am fattening like a battery hen  
Bleeding toenails, crusted eye sockets 
I hold onto my eggs so no-one can break them 
And 
I hold onto myself 
My own hands are there to hold 
Unsmoothed and bruised and cold and old 
Glistening jewels form in the space between wrinkles 
Caressed with bristles dipped in thick black tar 
Relief is printed in the space between the stars 
breasts engorged with the truth of it 
The voice comes out from my chest 
Devouring all the hours we spent 
Crumpling into dust that ripples up towards the quiet 
curling up in loneliness all along 
Only knowing how to hurt myself 
I left her all alone 
I left my body broken  
Screaming out a futile desperate question 
Why does every body have to leave 
Why does every body 
have to leave me here with me 

In my darkest light 
I know the answer 
Piercing silence 
A cacophony of nothingness 
The shattering of yet another shell 
To begin 
Again 

It’s not something to be traversed 
With a lifeline hooked between our belt loops 
It’s a deep sinking pool with me in the centre 
Again
And all my childhood bedtime stories 
remembered reeds stretch upwards 
Again 
From the sea bed
with their dirty fingernails
All rotted brown and red 
Again 
Grazing at the razor cuts that clothe the bones of my shattered ankles 
Again 
It’s something just for me 
No soft warm dressing gown 
To climb inside the sleeve of
The only comforting pulse in my ear my own 
And the murky fluid of my aching brain 
leaks out in spite of me 
While I attempt my version of rest 
Mixing with drool I leave on your pillow 
More absorbent to the touch
than the softness of your chest 
A wet and cold and fleeting memory 
That I really was here
I really was here 
In a bed just wide enough to never find you sleeping next to me 
 
Now stolen to a lower altitude 
Getting over Going under 
Never going through with you 
Through; 
Now, 
that’s only 
something a copilot can do 

A beginning;
Again - 
I sense my way through the dirt
A worm cut in two 
Two cut in four 
Cold 
Nakedness 
Earth around my ears 
My ends are my beginnings 
And Here, 
From the bottom of it all
It starts
 
Again -

A sordid tale’s first sentence 
Enters my opened mouth:

[[notBorges/lexicomythography/particle/strange/on the ligature of two characters]]



And here, 

From the underside of everything 

I devour myself 

From end to beginning 

I eat myself 
 
Alive
