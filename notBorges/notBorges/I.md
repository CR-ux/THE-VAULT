suffix
1 forming the plural of nouns adopted from Latin ending in -us: foci | timpani.
2 forming the plural of nouns adopted from Italian ending in -e or -o: dilettanti.
USAGE
Many nouns derived from a foreign language retain their foreign plural, at least when they first enter English and particularly if they belong to a specialist field. Over time, though, it is quite normal for a word in general use to acquire a regular English plural. This may coexist with the foreign plural (e.g. cactus, plural cacti or cactuses) or it may actually oust a foreign plural. Note that not all Latin words ending in -us have a plural that ends in -i: for example, the Latin word apparatus is unchanged in the plural
