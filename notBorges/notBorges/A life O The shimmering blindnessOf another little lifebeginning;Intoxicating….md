As yet another handsome Ending Is caressing my hair bicep bulging as a lock is tucked and turned behind my earthe Ending shifts his weight in finality across the benchwe have come to call our ownto steal a smile, popping spit bubbles formed in the corners of his lips
to lean into the crook of my neck to whisper down my death row throat
and gently tell me this:
“You Are  your own great riverYour swallowed love like stepping stones”
Each greedy gulp a gatewayto the next 
Casting nets 
to catch your breath Each onea quiet wave A reflection’s shudderIn a ripple of judgementa life-rafted opportunity
To be seen as a mirror"
Then in the spoiling swirls of love Gripped at the ankleBy some forgotten weed
Nicked at the knee By the sharpest rocks the Men condensed and pressured themselves into
and I am dragged in my nakedness skin burning, like a comet an uncontainable ether tethered to this wretched weighta thinning shard of glass and a makeup brushto shape a heaving block of granite And at the bottom
I plant my insignificant seedsLetting rot my shameful gardenUpon the surfaceLaying waste my raked and beaten heart
The dulling visageOf all my endings; Unbearable. Unbearable calm Brutal Serenity a sin I wind myself into a ball within Delicate Tendrils of sinew to bind my mind to times I let disgusting men in Yet something tells me to begin Again Each return in turn is licked by the very first beginning The origin of the odyssey The deafening wail of the unflattering tale of a victim as a hero And yet And still Stillness is still here Where A quieter voice slowly reveals itself Unfurling amplitude in every part of my life My brain contains an open space of Hymn big strong hurt in a whittled little heart Again 
I am fattening like a battery hen  

Bleeding toenails, crusted eye sockets 
I hold onto my eggs so no-one can break them And I hold onto myself My own hands are there to hold Unsmoothed and bruised and cold and old 
Glistening jewels form in the space between wrinkles Caressed with bristles dipped in thick black tar Relief is printed in the space between the stars breasts engorged with the truth of it The voice comes out from my chest Devouring all the hours we spent Crumpling into dust that ripples up towards the quiet curling up in loneliness all along Only knowing how to hurt myself I left her all alone I left my body broken  Screaming out a futile desperate question Why does every body have to leave Why does every body have to leave me here with me In my darkest light I know the answer Piercing silence A cacophony of nothingness The shattering of yet another shell To begin Again 
It’s not something to be traversed With a lifeline hooked between our belt loops It’s a deep sinking pool with me in the centre AgainAnd all my childhood bedtime stories remembered reeds stretch upwards Again From the sea bed with their dirty fingernails All rotted brown and red Again Grazing at the razor cuts that clothe the bones of my shattered ankles Again It’s something just for me No soft warm dressing gown To climb inside the sleeve of The only comforting pulse in my ear my own And the murky fluid of my aching brain leaks out in spite of me While I attempt my version of rest Mixing with drool I leave on your pillow More absorbent to the touch than the softness of your chest A wet and cold and fleeting memory That I really was here I really was here In a bed just wide enough to never find you sleeping next to me 
 Now stolen to a lower altitude Getting over Going under Never going through with you Through; Now, that’s only something a copilot can do A beginning; Again - I sense my way through the dirt A worm cut in two Two cut in four Cold Nakedness Earth around my ears My ends are my beginnings 
And Here, 
From the bottom of it all
It starts
 Again -
A sordid tale’s first sentence 
Enters my opened mouth And here, From the underside of everything I devour myself 
From end to beginning 
I eat myself 
 Alive 
(Again)
