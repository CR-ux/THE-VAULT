Full of the wrath of my father 
I am weary with holding in
My pain an aching compass 
My failures are my holiness 


birds tell me stories with their wings 
Spelling their arrangement in the sky 


Thou hath occupied His wretched vessel 
Holding in the hopelessness
Thy pain an aching compass 
(Thy failures are thy holiness)

Thou hath distorted what was given 

Therefore I am full of the wrath of my father 
I am weary with holding in

The emptiness 
Thy emptiness 
My emptiness 

Contortion into a rose petal 
Knowing only loneliness 

  
Conversational salad 






the Now and The One 

The Now right in the middle 
The Oneness on the outside of
Understanding those two coexisting are in an infinite loop of self regeneration through self awareness
