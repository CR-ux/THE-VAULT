It was a good day. So why am I crying? I can choose between the two brands of toothpaste, each of the tubes shouting profanities in two different languages at me in the grocery store aisle. I don’t need to understand them, I don’t need to translate, they both do the same thing. I just have to choose. And remember to use them. It’s not that big of a deal. It was a good day. I can choose to believe that people have chosen to love me for a reason or no reason and maybe no reason at all is just good enough. I haven’t been fooling anyone. But my skin is beginning to remember. It’s all sinking too close to the surface. It’s not too bruised and swollen to conceal with makeup now. 
Why is my heart a long distance runner? I’ve torn through driest brambles and thorns and come out adorned in petals of rose and jewels of blood droplets drying in a frosty afternoon, under greyer skies than the grey of my eyes. So why are they raining? I look so good today. So where am I going? Well, perhaps I don’t need to be going anywhere to look like this. A Christmas tree lives for its whole prolonged death indoors. So why am I crying? I don’t need to have plans on a Thursday night. I don’t need to honour anything said in the lightness of morning. 

It gets so dark this time of year. Maybe that’s why I’m crying? 


I can’t squander these gifts they’re so beautifully wrapped and there is no receipt to take anything back. 

All my previous hurdles have rushed past me and slipped like jellyfish stinging the fingers and whistled and boomed through the sound barrier and popped both of the ears in a thunderous change of altitude so why am I crying so close to the finish line anyway? Can’t I wait for the coda just a little bit longer? So again, deeper now. It deepens. I depend on the depth, that’s been the way through. How it’s always been. I am Well Versed in Waiting. I am a Carol Singer waiting at the doorstep of I. We were none of us made to wait, but the world has well weighted us with the wellspring of waiting. We are the unwavering experts now. 

it’s not so much of a failure to smoke a cigarette. If that’s what I need to hold onto, if that’s what I have to breathe in and hold onto. 

the NHS is the rusted hinge on a door that a Father walked out of, left open, open, open. The warm sting of surgical steel is our Mother’s embrace. the coldness of medicine does not Love the trans body. The trodden body. Our trodden, sodden body. It is ours to hold now. Our Love is Contained in the Next Breath we Keep Breathing. This Body of People in its grace is becoming. Amazing grace, how sweet the sight, in the scathing grazing mirror, that saved a wretch like me from Crying. So why, why am I crying? I can take the taste of metal. the taste of blood an old friend. I can withstand the taste of the tracing of my own fingers for the taking off of my ring. And all my other rings unwind. And the skin ‘round the thinness of my fingers won’t mind. I don’t need all these things. We don’t need to adorn ourselves to know we have value. So why is all this metal so heavy? Why on earth am I crying? Really, it’s really not so trying. This skull is a prison is a prism is a doorway is a different sort of way to let a little rainbow light in. It’s not so dark inside. There’s a tangled string of Christmas lights. I don’t want to write in green or red; I’ve only ever read; every word printed upon my sky and tried my best to honour what’s left of all of their meaning. My body isn’t so much of a battleground. so why am I crying? There are stained glass windows reaching up to the ceiling. There are ways to keep this Loving coalfire burning. Just hold on, a twinkling little starlight more. I can choose this brand of toothpaste. I can be around all these different types of delicious food that someone who likes myself could prepare in Love and have to turn down the heating when they open the oven to baste and I can taste the fat in the homemade gravy if I think hard enough and if all else fails I can do these Dishes For One. and I can iron my own pyjamas. and I can even buy an artificial Christmas tree. Bring the same one out again every year until I’m in the ground it never came from. and I can chew it all up, all these memories and this food into a paste and let that paste become nutrients and let the nutrition sink into my flesh and hark! Let it turn into shit and let the angels sing out that I’m allowed to shit in a public bathroom if I need to. It doesn’t have to all be so ding-dong-difficult. So why am I crying, so close to Christmas? Why am I crying? Why, am I, anyway? 






I can’t squander these gifts they’re so beautifully wrapped and there is no receipt to take anything back. So again it deepens in the rut. Depending on the depth, that’s always been the Throughput. Well Versed in Waiting, a Carol Singer waiting at the doorbell. We were none of us made to wait, but the world has weighted us down in the Well. The NHS a rusted hinge on a door that a Father passed through leaving open, open. The warm sting of surgical steel our Mother’s embrace. But the trodden body. The snowtrodden, cranberry-cinnamon sodden body. It is ours to hold now. Love contained in the rest of our Breathing. This Body of People in its grace is becoming. And such is this amazing grace, how sweet the sight, in the mirror giving wretched tears all their drying. I can take the taste of iron. Withstand the tonguetracing my fingers for the taking off of my ring. All other rings unwind. And the skin ‘round the thinness of fingers won’t mind. So why are these metal things so heavy? Really, it’s really not so trying. This skull once a prison, a prism, a doorway, a way to let a little light in. Not so dark inside. No place for crying. Hanging in there a tangled string of Christmas lights. I can't write in green or red; I’m made to read; all the words printed on my sky and try to honour all their meaning. Stained glass windows reach to the heaven-ceiling. Ways to keep this Loving coalfire burning. Holding on a twinkling little starlight more. I can stand amidst these groceries that someone could prepare in Love and turn down heating on opening the oven to baste and I can taste the fat in homemade gravy if I think hard enough. if all else fails I can do these Dishes For One. I can iron my own pyjamas. I can even buy an artificial tree. Bring the same one out again each year until I’m in the ground it never came from. I can chew it all up, all this memory-food into a paste that paste becoming nutrients and let nutrition sink into flesh and Hark! Let it turn into shit and let the angels sing that I’m allowed to shit in a public bathroom if I need to. It doesn’t have to be so ding-dong-ding-dong-difficult. Nights draw in. thick black ink and then, before you know it, warmth outside again.
