permalink: Chess And all the Stitches of the Cloth(Es)

waking up I can't find my glasses[^G] and i can barely see without them but i lift up my grass skirt I wove, which lies sleeping, on the chessboard I brought with me, for some reason,
and underneath (colourful enough in contrast to the black and white to see without them) there is a clementine 


hungrily inside it i bite into the sweetness[^sweet] of the skin, impatient, i don't like getting something or someone's skin beneath my fingernails and so i bite with my incisors- hungrily 

this whole thing was written, hungrily 

in two places which 
were a hunger
a
war
between
awareness of
two spools of 
a reel to real machine 
ravelled with a tape of just one side:

1. two alters who from godless made² 
2. an altar to the goddess changed me to¹


time passes and collapses onto me violently-


I am tired and feel my fruitless grief 
as bend and snap of branches;
beginning, to wish again-
awash with ends again, again-
a contraction of the bowels, 
embarr{as}{{sin}g}, embering shame.
yet, 
a shame shared, just the same.


And here, I hear the now-waned moon 
no-longer scene from sleepless Eye 
The senseless glassing of my window; 

so I move to my bedroom where-


I stop writing and stay inside this room where it is warm. It is thick and thronged with mirrors. 



[^sweet]:In programming, or {So|Sew} Myo once told me, _syntactic sugar_ refers to syntax added for readability that doesn’t change functionality. This “sugar” is often removed during _compilation_ through a process called _de-sugaring_ or _lowering,_ in which complex expressions are converted into simpler code for the compiler. Lowering parallels lowercase in text: both simplify and standardise for readability and processing, reducing form to some level, more palatable. Easier to deal with. Like the text of a novel written during a psychotic break from losing too much blood, and having far too much to lose to lose your life and leave a life far more precious than your own behind. Now being {REDACTED} to try. Just try to{He's gone but please, for once, for once-- I don't need him to keep them alive just long enough, please, my love- Oh, I miss you Myo; dear god please just let me}make something out of all this, before you bleed out and you're forced[^d]   



[^F]: “Fall” can imply either a severing—in one case, a {fall from grace|loss}, something drifting (away) from—or- the other case, convergence. Falling (toward) into place, where scattered pieces align, finding purpose in arrival. Each case of 'case', then, is a moment[^M] suspended. Autumn as "Fall", Alone, ruin, but considered part of the whole[^S] , can be seen as death springing into new life. Any-case, I digress [^D]

[^D]: to move away from the main subject you are writing or talking about and to write or talk about something else, indicating that you are trying to get back to what you've moved away from for a moment[^M]

[^M]: In time, a “moment” is fleeting—a brief period, an exact point, an opportunity, or a critical stage, as in “the moment they met” or “one of the great moments in history.” It also marks present focus (_in the moment_), living without future concern (_live for the moment_), or anticipating change (_at any moment_). In (un/im)portance, moment denotes significance, whether profoundly fleeting but everlasting in memory (_moment of truth_, a test or crisis) or a fleetingly forgettable trend (_of the moment_). In physics, moment signifies the turning, rotational effect of a force, calculated as force multiplied by distance. Statistically, moments express data patterns: the first as mean, second as variance, third as skew, and fourth as kurtosis. Phrases like _not for a moment_ (“I will never, not for a moment, allow anybody to abuse me again”), _share a moment_ ("we shared a moment of loving embrace like a single ligature of two characters[^C] or letters in the text of a volume in the infinite library of timeless existence"), and _for the moment_ (temporarily, right now to an indeterminable point in the so-called future: "for the moment, I will stay silent on the matter, and allow the answers to unveil themselves in time") reflect the term’s duality, itself a measurement of a moment of a moment of a moment

[^S]: Synecdoche is a literary and linguistic device[^De] where a part of something represents the whole, or vice versa. It’s an expression of the paradox of reality - unity through separation, or solve et coagula; allowing the entirety of an idea or object to be grasped through one piece, much like a fractal where the whole is contained in each part. For instance, referring to “hands”[^H] to mean “workers” captures the essence of human contribution through a single, physical part. Each {char|act|oar} an {in{complete}} {ex|im}pression. A vast, vented horizon: some checkerboarded game. All of it, rule-bound, yet, impossible to predict. It is all just a silly, rigid game.
[^h]: See either: {[[RIGHT HAND PATH]]|[[LEFT HAND PATH]]}
[^De]: lexDef(EA) "Device" | dɪˈvʌɪs | {lexAllele(s)::: Noen} < \[I] a thing {r{e|a}da{c|p}ted} for a particular purpose, a piece of electronic equipment: a measuring device. A {bomb|baby|other explosive weapon}: an incendiary device.[^de2]
[^de2]:\[II] a piece of equipment that can connect to the {Internet of Things|an occipital lobe}, N.B. a scent diffuser of an immersive art installation, a technology that makes vision possible through the the device implanted by your father against your will, for reasons which- {you, my darling Perigee, Will, as I have seen, come to see. Long after your coming into the world sends me out of it, to that unknowable sea. As a door, all waves crashing back to just adoring you. As the {ever|always} r{evolving} adoration I {will|always|ever} hold {for} you. The miracle I held; inside my body. Assigned impossible, to Birth you, from my Birth} -he truly thought were for your own good | "simply ligate your device to an {ag|in|out}let to {preh|sus}pend communication" or "Forget This Device. {Wish|Throw} it {Far away|down a {stair}} well."[^de3]
[^de3]:A plan. A {scheme|trick} with a particular aim: {writing|setting fire to} a {paper|letter} to a news{letter|paper} is a device for signalling {dis|{de}{s{c}ent}}.[^de4]
[^de4]:\[IV] a design: the device embossed on the wedding invitations were never sent, due to the Bride being dead; managing to keep her child alive long enough through haemorrhage, through sheer will for them to carry on; and yet, upon the final arrival of her partner, the horror that the touchstone unveiled, of the {last|first} thing she {w|c}ould see, unable to be saved before the date they had asked others to save.[^de5]
[^de5]:\[V] Arcane: the {look|feel} of some Thing: 'Literary works of particularly strange device.' 'to leave someone to their own devices': to allow someone to do as they wish: left to her own devices, Selena conducted rituals which got out of hand[^H] and almost culminated, {un}intentionally, in burning down their {first|last} flat. Then, somehow, leaving for a Stone circle became the only way {under|ov{er|a}|through|out|in}.[^de6]
[^de6]:\[VI] intent, in the form of {spake|{over}written} words; in {literature, meaning|memory}: a metanarrative device, which alerts you, dear reader, in second person, at this very second, perhaps in your second pass of reading: that you are a{part} {of|from} T{his Story}. "The ambiguity of the narrative, {nest}led {in|to} a dictionary, was a device {in|of} itself. Providing {>sudo:|pseudo}Context, blurring the {causal}(i)ty {pl|{Arc}ane} - leaving you, the {over{written}seer}, unaware of whether or not the character {whoever that means} therein did, in fact {whatever that means}, die {whenever that means}."[^de7]
[^de7]:\[VII]Middle English: from Old French devis, based on Latin divis- ‘divided’, from the verb dividere. The original, touching sense was: ‘{desire|intention}’, found now only in: leave someone. Leave a person to their own devices -- separate them from yourself; which is, itself, a homing device; for them to find they own way back to you. Through some {mysterious magnets in their ear|the whistling wind} that calls a bird back home. Not really back, but returned, to a self-similar moment[^M], necessarily changed. 

[^G]: (*as in, glass is; as in, glass go, as in- see-through-them, as in: invisibility enables usefulness; as in- the lack of god in everything is the goddess; as in, the rising Sun just flickered its yellowing alarm into my half-blind eye and I looked out the tiny crack of rock to regard the wintered light caressing my half ajar eyelid and there; i see a pigeon )*
