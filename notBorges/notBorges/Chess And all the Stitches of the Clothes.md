Chess 
And all the 
Stitching of the
Endlessness, this-
this is all unravelling to 
this is all coming together into 
this is all unravelling into some thing to come back to
think is all coming together into some useless being been the most important journey of this life is all unravelling to this is all culminating in this is what i've been waiting to come out of me but replacing with desire for you to come in me is all unravelling to something that's not thread together with you to this is all just one big meaning making machine to make meaning of the life that's coming together into one big person made of infinitely many other people split into all unravelling into circles rapt together through dimensions all unravelling into some thing that i thought i knew but this must all dissolve into a cup of water as a drug as drank by God who is unravelled into every thread of memory which you moulded in to get her into lego bricks of reddened meaning making this is all inside of the best nightmare of my life i was my rapist with the memory of some thing that unravelled into this has all been come two get her three two one two three two I have been unravelled into you are in the labyrinth of wall by hand and fist is all there is a fire of course desire is why this hurts so much is why i heal so well fare well enough my want to go home empty crush for us to push just one split two split three  for fabric of unravelled tapestry of memory of the goddess you have all unravelled into this is all its coming to a home no longer there to go to god is waiting for the meaning to be made unravelled into strips of meat to hang in rooms to cure disease through microbes altogether injecting skin which rots and falls away from bone unravelled in to stores of genome memory {REDACTED} all are circles all unravelling to reel to reel machines as insects in a dream to real to reel to real to dream to you come back to me history been hearing here lead to a yellow dog who angrily tries to catch a bird who laughs up in a tree who stands silent knowingly will come apart to me to you to her to you to me to you to her to god to dog to goddess in between the waves of all you me you i think there four three two three one to this is all a rhythm to a song that is unraveling
through everything 
that stitches all 
as pockets of the goddess 
who has know idea she has entire worlds 
inside her who 
have no idea they have entire worlds inside them 
and 
above them 
all 
unravels into molecules 
who know no thing 
but just the circle 
they're contained in 
is all unravelling to a witness
theories of the numbers, gymnasts
who have no idea they run through 
everything is coming down up through to 
this is all unravelled into strings of childhood blanket 
violins are all mourn-sighing into 
ice cream cakes and homebaked pastries
are all split spilt into drink your 
dedication 
to the gods 
we lost 
unravelling 
our blood to feed 
the brain 
an insect 
which grew to two too two to too
much dissolution to 
come back to
anything
the same 
unravelled but 
that -
this.
that 'i am'
you; 
that -
this 'you'
am i-
this.
it. 
the truth.
and this.

it's coming to

is alive 
and meaning itself is alive 
and The meaning we ascribe to information 
to alleviate suffering is alive
and the suffering is alive 
like viruses

just looking for 
a place to live 
not wanting
anyone to die
just wanting 


the meaning 

evolves alongside
memory of information

whether in a race of arms
or in the arms of faceless 
one-time
lovers

or symbiosis 
of both


meaning, it is dancing 
with the things we know

as two snakes around a sword.
{information|meaning|

the central rod, awareness

awareness of their dancing 
whether aware of awareness 
or 

is this 

System of meaning 
Traversing meaning 

Opened
ever closing 

Narrowed to be 
Opening 

Meaning, shifting 
Meaning: growing

Meaning 
it is 
living 

Meaning it has Will, 
it Wills to live alone. 
But
Life itself being Being
is suffering 
 or Stories 
 also known as information 
 mating with the meaning 
 we are {given|taking}
we are a body
our work becoming stories within stories 
	this whole thing is just a story

		a story of a tower 
	within a star 
		within a story 
		of a story of an oracle
		 in a dying star 
		 within a story of a loss
		of all
		 unravelled into {something|one} now separate 
		 from what we are: a fiction 
		 also called a lie but 
		 its unfolding 
		 like a blanket laid by lover 
		 under branches, keeping your

		   clean and it's a story
		    under story

waking up I can't find my glasses[^G] and i can barely see without them but i lift up my grass skirt I wove, which lies sleeping, on the chessboard I brought with me, for some reason,
and underneath (colourful enough in contrast to the black and white to see without them) there is a clementine 


hungrily inside it i bite into the sweetness[^sweet] of the skin, impatient, i don't like getting something or someone's skin beneath my fingernails and so i bite with my incisors- hungrily 

this whole thing was written, hungrily 

in two places which 
were a hunger
a
war
between
awareness of
two spools of 
a reel to real machine 
ravelled with a tape of just one side:

1. two alters who from godless made² 
2. an altar to the goddess changed me to¹

{now again|back then} at my altar sur{{rounding}|real} with me 
{be|cast a|in|out}side my temple, 
(Mis)erably, (en)dlessly, 
(aby)s(m)ally, in(e)vitable 

time passes and collapses onto me violently-

I wanted to go out to the trees and worship, but after writing furiously all day, the timer certainly not moving at any snail's pace, but rather, like that great mystery of its shell's curvature, or your love, my love, of the slow, deliberate curvature of your form, indescribable-- in the way of a wave that can never come back again, or, in{definitely} that:
it was never here to begin with.
Never able to be caught, 
never reaching that far stretching and unknowable shore;
that impossibly projected 
futile arrow's trajectory; 
headed for a most useless place.
a point, of no point-
in illusory time 
at one equally delusive 
time 
so desired
in hopelessness
elusive and hope of shared delusion. 

I am tired and feel my fruitless grief bend and snap my branches;
beginning, again-
to wash over me, again-
a contraction of the bowels, 
embarrassing, a shame.
yet, 
a shame shared, just the same.

I have no other 
from whom to perceive myself 
in shame
through relation 
as a mirror. 

Or, rather, 
I have exactly 
the same amount of company 
as I did for most of the time
it was deemed appropriate 
for me to ask for yours. 

And here, I think of the now-waning moon 
that I no longer see from the sleepless Eye 
The senseless glassing of my window; 

so I move to my bedroom where


I stop writing and stay inside this room 
where it is warm. 
It is thick and thronged with mirrors. 



[^sweet]:In programming, or {So|Sew} Myo once told me, _syntactic sugar_ refers to syntax added for readability that doesn’t change functionality. This “sugar” is often removed during _compilation_ through a process called _de-sugaring_ or _lowering,_ in which complex expressions are converted into simpler code for the compiler. Lowering parallels lowercase in text: both simplify and standardise for readability and processing, reducing form to some level, more palatable. Easier to deal with. Like the text of a novel written during a psychotic break from losing too much blood, and having far too much to lose to lose your life and leave a life far more precious than your own behind. Now being {REDACTED} to try. Just try to{He's gone but please, for once, for once-- I don't need him to keep them alive just long enough, please, my love- Oh, I miss you Myo; dear god please just let me}make something out of all this, before you bleed out and you're forced[^d]

[^F]: “Fall” can imply either a severing—in one case, a {fall from grace|loss}, something drifting (away) from—or- the other case, convergence. Falling (toward) into place, where scattered pieces align, finding purpose in arrival. Each case of 'case', then, is a moment[^M] suspended. Autumn as "Fall", Alone, ruin, but considered part of the whole[^S] , can be seen as death springing into new life. Any-case, I digress [^D]

[^D]: to move away from the main subject you are writing or talking about and to write or talk about something else, indicating that you are trying to get back to what you've moved away from for a moment[^M]

[^M]: In time, a “moment” is fleeting—a brief period, an exact point, an opportunity, or a critical stage, as in “the moment they met” or “one of the great moments in history.” It also marks present focus (_in the moment_), living without future concern (_live for the moment_), or anticipating change (_at any moment_). In (un/im)portance, moment denotes significance, whether profoundly fleeting but everlasting in memory (_moment of truth_, a test or crisis) or a fleetingly forgettable trend (_of the moment_). In physics, moment signifies the turning, rotational effect of a force, calculated as force multiplied by distance. Statistically, moments express data patterns: the first as mean, second as variance, third as skew, and fourth as kurtosis. Phrases like _not for a moment_ (“I will never, not for a moment, allow anybody to abuse me again”), _share a moment_ ("we shared a moment of loving embrace like a single ligature of two characters[^C] or letters in the text of a volume in the infinite library of timeless existence"), and _for the moment_ (temporarily, right now to an indeterminable point in the so-called future: "for the moment, I will stay silent on the matter, and allow the answers to unveil themselves in time") reflect the term’s duality, itself a measurement of a moment of a moment of a moment

[^S]: Synecdoche is a literary and linguistic device[^De] where a part of something represents the whole, or vice versa. It’s an expression of the paradox of reality - unity through separation, or solve et coagula; allowing the entirety of an idea or object to be grasped through one piece, much like a fractal where the whole is contained in each part. For instance, referring to “hands”[^H] to mean “workers” captures the essence of human contribution through a single, physical part. Each {char|act|oar} an {in{complete}} {ex|im}pression. A vast, vented horizon: some checkerboarded game. All of it, rule-bound, yet, impossible to predict. It is all just a silly, rigid game.

[^De]: device | dɪˈvʌɪs | noun || a thing {r{e|a}da{c|p}ted} for a particular purpose, a piece of electronic equipment: a measuring device. • a {bomb|baby|other explosive weapon}: an incendiary device. • a piece of equipment that can connect to the {Internet of Things|an occipital lobe}, N.B. a scent diffuser of an immersive art installation, a technology that makes vision possible through the the device implanted by your father against your will, for reasons which- {you, my darling Perigee, Will, as I have seen, come to see.

A {scheme|trick} with a particular aim: {writing|setting fire to} a {paper|letter} to a news{letter|paper} is a device for signalling {dis|{de}{s{c}ent}}. • intent, in the form of {spake|written} words; in {speech|literature}: a metanarrative device which alerts you, the reader, in second person, at this very second, that you are part of this story. 3 a design: the device embossed on the wedding invitations were never sent, due to the Bride being dead; managing to keep her child alive long enough through haemorrhage, through sheer will for them to carry on; and yet, upon the final arrival of her partner, the horror that her touching him unveiled, of the last thing she would see, unable to be saved before the date they had asked others to save. arcane: the look of some Thing: works of particularly strange device. 't'o leave someone to their own devices': to allow someone to do as they wish: left to her own devices, Selena conducted rituals which got out of hand[^H] and almost culminated in unintentionally burning down their flat, and somehow leaving for a Stone circle became the only way {under|ov{er|a}|through|out|in}. Middle English: from Old French devis, based on Latin divis- ‘divided’, from the verb dividere. The original, touching sense was: ‘{desire|intention}’, found now only in: leave someone. Leave a person to their own devices -- separate them from yourself; which is, itself, a device; for them to find they own way back to you. Through some mysterious magnets in their ear; the whistling wind that calls a bird back home. Not really back, but returned to a self-similar moment[^M] necessarily changed.
