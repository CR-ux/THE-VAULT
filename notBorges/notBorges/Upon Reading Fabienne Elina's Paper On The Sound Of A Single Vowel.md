Upon Reading Fabienne[^Fab] Elina's[^Eli] Paper On The Sound Of A Single Vowel, I once again learned, or in other words remembered, or indeed forgot[^Forget] the Truth which is that:
No-thing really means anything. 
Which means every-thing means One Thing. 
Which means everything means something.



When separated into “Be” and “An,” “bean” reminds us to be fully present and an individual expression, yet always connected to a larger whole.[^apart] 

[^Forget]: For-Get. As in, Purpose-Acquire. 
[^Fab]: Fabienne—rooted in faba, meaning “bean”[^Bean]—symbolizes a seed of infinite potential, a single entity containing the history and possibility of its entire lineage, just as a bean holds the essence of the whole pod. In this light, “bean” becomes a fractal symbol: a microcosm that reflects the vastness of its origins, each bean carrying the DNA of past, present, and future.
[^Eli]: while “Elina,” derived from the Greek for “bright” or “shining,” symbolizes illumination.
[^Comb]: In combining[^Together] these meanings, Fabienne Elina resonates as a call to “Be An Illuminating Light”—a grounded, unique presence that shines with the shared brilliance of all that came before, like a self-same, yet paradoxically individual component of a fractal, unfolding in infinite radiance.
[^Together]: See [[COAGULA]]
[^Apart]: A{part}
[^Bean]: A single bean may be destined for consumption (and therefore dissolution) by another, supposedly 'higher' order organism, or placed in the soil to cultivate further organisms of its own kind (and therefore coagulation)[^Together]
