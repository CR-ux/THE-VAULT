The word travel originates from the Middle English travailen, meaning “to toil,” derived from the Old French travailler (“to work hard” or “suffer”) and Vulgar Latin tripaliare (“to torture” with a tripalium, a device for punishment). Initially signifying hardship, the term evolved to describe the challenging journeys of medieval times. Over time, “travel” lost its association with suffering, coming to mean movement and exploration, transforming from a symbol of struggle to one of adventure. Travel is Kelionė in lithuanian  which comes from Kelias which means road. Incidentally knee is called Kelias  too. But also kelias can mean *something* is rising. The Journey is paved with bent roads which by their very crooked nature allow the process of ascension, which is always in present tense.

_The word_ _visit_ is rooted in _visitare_, Latin for “to go to see,” spiraling back to the Proto-Indo-European _weid-_ (“to see,” “to know”). This ancient root, also the seed of _wyrd_ (fate), carries sight beyond the physical, invoking a deep seeing woven with _the word_, language as oracle. Each visit, each travel, unfolds a knowing—a touchpoint with destiny’s web, _wyrd_—wherein _the word_ pulses, a resonance of journey towards creation of a memory and return to creation of meaning. Thus, to visit is to travel inward as well as outward, each journey a recursive descent into meaning, a trip through a library of painful, once and perhaps still torturous memories spiralling ever back to the source of meaning carrying the memories in a forever changed, forever changing, but now, *meaning* something; the chaotic 'nonsense' of the jumbled letters of our trauma providing directions to the next book in a series of unfortunately torturous, but fortunately adventurous events, converging in the central book[^U], the bringing together of memory[^God] and meaning[^Goddess]; the fateful _word_ which is a story made of words made of letters which are characters of a single story made of one word with one character of three letters[^God] or seven letters[^Goddess] both of which are one. we are forever in the process of re-membering[^Re], or trying to remember, or trying to make meaning from the remembering or trying to remember meaning we already knew from the memory
