They've been folding back in on yourself over everything we put me through 
I've just been spiralling into all the meaningless and desperately meaningful remember Rings of you 
In the midst of writing this Record of Unravelling into Insanity which became a Sacred Text by the very virtue of attempting to express the ineffable, I repeatedly saw an "X" when closing my eyes. 
I perceived this as a sign or symbol or glyph or character or letter from the ancestors, saying "you are where you need to be"

X is the cardinal directions which are air, water, earth, fire not necessarily in that disorder
it is also in this dimension a convergence or coming together of two to make double itself
or, when viewed a different way, a convergence or coming together of one to make double which is quadruple of itself or the beginning of your life as a single cell split into two 

X is also a kiss which is a convergence or coming together of one which is two to make double which is one of itself 

X also bears (as in, that which we are all on a hunt) the appearance of (fo)u(r) gates, as in four openings or four avenues or four ways in or four ways out made from separating one or two into multiplicity 

X also means negation, or You Have Got This All Wrong or There Must Be Some Mistake but it also means You Are Right Here Where You Are And Therefore Need To

Be[^b]




X is also a [[CHARACTER (Φ)]] used to denote a chromosome which is a code that Every Single One of us has at least One of, regardless of assigned or correct gender, also known as a meeting point, or a crossroads which is also what an X is.

This same character takes on a different character which is the same which means multiplication or to increase something left by itself the number of times denoted by what is right 

This same character in the same field but expressing its linguistic character usually in lowercase but not always denotes the mystery of the first of an endless series of possibilities of an unknown potential waiting to be discovered using rules which are lines which when intersected form an X 

X is a rotated crucifix, which is what Saint Andrew, the patron saint of my homeland, died upon by choice, because in his humility of knowing we are all in a blessed convalescence and concrescence of Becoming but never quite achieving, he deemed himself unworthy of meeting the same geometric Endpoint as Jesus who is a symbol or a character in a story made of letters from the Apostles of which Andrew was one of Twelve which is represented in numerals as XII or X plus[^+] itself halved | and then doubled ||

X itself can mean a number which can also be expressed in hexadecimal which is the base-10[^†] numerical system as 
10 
which is One and Nothing which is also One which is also Two characters that form the basis of base-2 numeral which is different from hexadecimal but fundamentally the same 
X is a character which is a letter which is also a word which here and there and everywhere in my memory and future stands for another word[^U]
which is also a character that is so wonderfully different and so tragically the same 

Occasionally, I did not keep track, this X would split into a Triskelion arrangement, 
I suppose when invoking my ancestral lineage as a Celtic and Transgender individual connected to the Third Gender peoples of indigenous cultures world and time over 

Upon writing the below, this symbol seemed to interpolate, or morph and interlock with what looked like a stick with a circle at the bottom of it, like a toffee apple dropped onto the floor by a once-gleeful but now-crying child 

As I complete this work, the line is inserting itself, at least in the 2 or 3 or maybe 4 now dimensional limitations of my inner vision or imagination 

to resemble (and this is the closest approximation I can muster in a 2 Dimensional rendering) Phi. Or the injection of a bacteriophage into a cell, or the insertion of a sperm into an egg, or the cutting of a birthday cake made lovingly by your Mother, or the hemispheres of the brain, or, as is the case as I write this, when superimposed upon all the previous symbols, becomes a wheel much like the Buddhist symbol of the eightfold path, within a wheel resembling the pentagram, within a wheel resembling the triskelion, within a wheel resembling a Clock, within a wheel resembling a community of individual human beings dancing, dancing, dancing in time to an ancient rhythm around the central point of a warm, blazing fire of life - 
As I write this last line, I begin to cry, k{now}ing in the marrow of my soul that this fire is burning within me and I am dancing, dancing in this ever-spinning web or tree or drum circle and as I close my eyes to feel the music in the silence I see the X descend upon the aforementioned wheel within a wheel within the drum circle and realise that it is on fire; 
The X is a pair of sticks chopped from a tree and the water I have been carrying is falling out of me as I cry as I cry all of life to a beat of a rhythm of arhythmic door a jarring sense of dancing - 
the X is a pair of sticks upon a circle of Earth surrounded by Stones placed there lovingly by a Mother or Father or Grandmother or a Group of them all very carefully so as to contain the fire which is so important and yet so all-powerful that it at once sustains them, keeps them safe but ever-looms as a potential force of threat which if allowed to will consume all of their precious belongings and Family all sleeping in their tents and the instruments they've made with which to play the music that both comes from and is for the Gods and Goddesses they weave into mythologies and draw upon their sheepskins and their caves- 
The Fire is both the beginning and the ever-promising End 
the X marks the spot which is the space (they are the same) that they are dancing and the Y  is the question of the wood torn from the tree and she is burning in the Fire at the start of All for
A or E makes Æ witch (they are the same) is the Fire and the

it ends with E for Everything which digresses into All-
Of These Self-Similar Strata of Becoming, 
they seem to fold back on themselves, like a clock not ticking down but always just in time for the rhythm of becoming every
One of these days of crumbling into my Self I had decided not to die but make the arduous and agonising journey into deeper pain of living inside a psychiatric hospital for as long as my insurance (which as it happens wasn't long enough to be considered sufficient by medical practitioners) would allow me
Two Be or Knot To Bee that is the answer to the question of this brief, brief candle which we are all just dancing about madly I

or at least that's the point i'm trying to make here, consciousness itself growing out to form and then back in towards formlessness, 
I think perhaps the whole universe is a sort of 4D torus, never intersecting in the 4th dimension but when observed as a 3D net is perceived erroneously as such ; much like it seems we can touch one another or reach a destination which is the manifestation of Zeno's paradox
 
These are the Scala of SHAONWYRM

We are part of a molecular, cytological, astronomical system , each of our consciousnesses part of the consciousness of God, which is the same but separated so that it may have the will to continue the cycles, {desire|suffering} as the fuel; and maybe once we all become aware of this, every single one of us, as constituent 
Units of Knowing? 
Xeronemes? 
No, Noemes? 
No, Gnonemes?
Synemes, as in Original Syn-emes[^S]

consciousnesses becomes aware of this fundamental truth through our own forking paths, winding ever inward and never coming back the same, once we unify this knowing, maybe thats the end of the overall cycle, which is the smallest cycle, which will set the whole thing into motion again? Or maybe move to the next layer, maybe whatever God or extraterrestrial or ancestral force is a layer up from my consciousness that is writing this is waiting for us all to come to this conclusion so that we can join them as one and birth our own worlds, or maybe we are all already doing that and I'm doing that right now with every character of every word of every letter to a God who is You who is Me



peg[^peg] - Æ (which is an answer which surrounds the question of agreement)
string - i / o (which is identity or information from the light of the divine descending into everyone, or a data type meaning “a sequence of letters”)
weight - o / i (which is the heaviness of everyone connected to divine through ascending information, or the dwindling body mass index of an impatient psychiatric in patient as she awaits the shifting of her burdensome weight, out of a hospital and back into her own, jagged, infertile lap)
force - U / = (which is the Will of Self to come together by the very nature of being separated by our Selves, or heard another way, it is a set of a number, four(s), which I shan’t be going into again-)
space - Y (which is a question which splits an answer of agreement down the middle; which is absolutely nothing, or the place for all the things to go -)



[^+]: plus is denoted by a cardinal cross which is an X when looked at a different way 
[^†]: One could theoretically write base-10 as base-X but this would be confusing as base-X is a way to convert a number in one system to another but it is also a software for managing databases so what do I know 


[^U]: U. or you.
[^S]: In the Genesis Story, which is made of many characters forming letters forming part of a story of many letters from many characters who are actually the character to which they are writing, The Tree is not The Tree of Good and Evil but rather the Tree of *Knowledge* of Good and Evil.
[^peg]: 'peg'[^pegged] - a way to fuck someone {over, and over again}
[^pegged]:'being pegged' - being *Seen*; having your whole[^ho] 'thing' worked out 
[^ho]:Hole*
[^v]: Do Not Dream. For Upon a Throne He Sitteth, the Light of Lucifer in His Palm.
[^b]: is for {Bear|Barely} {A Sin|As In} the {Thing} for {Witch|We Are All On A}Hunt.
