when night falls I start to try to change my mind enough so that it won’t change me knowing full well it is a sinking as inevitable as gravity thinking physical and emotional pain must come from the same place because both get so much worse at night where salty springs run through my swollen mountain face to the rusted well of recoiled wondering if maybe pain itself is alive and a mostly nocturnal entity that lays half sleeping in the sun or maybe I’ve just got to know the dark from all its sides illuminating  pain the daytime hides through distraction and pollution: a familiar wretched unfair comparison or maybe it’s not about the amount of light (i know it can always get much darker) but rather bedtime’s unironed pyjamas as a marker, reminding you of solitude and the leaving unawareness of nobody else’s breathing in the room finally bringing down the weight of that you realised too late the load on wheels in wheels unspoke the heaviness of empty boulder you hoped would be easier to shoulder the desperate plea unfairly dealt in shrouded stars of scars and prayers and welts the knotted rosary aware of heaving mass alone to bear and lighter spots more slimming shots and looser belts of how it felt to share the lot with someone else
