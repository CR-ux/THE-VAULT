Information is alive 
and meaning itself is alive 
and The meaning we ascribe to information to alleviate suffering is alive
and the suffering is alive 
like insects and plants 
like viruses and animals 
the meaning evolves alongside the memory of information
whether in an arms race 
or a symbiosis or both
meaning is in a dance with information
the two serpents of the caduceus 
are information and meaning 
and the central rod is awareness
the awareness of their dancing 
whether we are aware of this awareness 
or not 


System of meaning 

Traversing meaning

Meaning shifting 

Meaning grow_ng

Meaning itself living 

Meaning and [[SEMANTIC]]s an evolving lifeform with Will of its Own 

Life itself being Being which is suffering witch is suffering which is being 

Life itself being Stories also known as information mixed up inexorably with the meaning we take from it 

Life itself being information and the meaning we ascribe to it 

Life itself being the meaning we ascribe to information  

Life itself being the meaning we ascribe to information in order to alleviate suffering

Life itself a Being that is trying to make meaning from the memories its made up of but it can't remember except for listening to the individual parts that make up its own becoming stories within stories this whole thing is just a story in a story in a story in a story of a tower within a star within a story of a story of an oracle within a star within a story of a story jumbled up has all unravelled into someone separate from what we are a story also called a lie but its unfolding like a blanket laid by lover under a tree to keep your nice dress clean and it's a story under story under standing stone a story and unstuck the sword and gory man becomes his mother she a crone or crow becomes a dragon not a drag queen but she knows it won't be read or under stood there in her memory is a toy that once she used to image-in the day she's at right now and cry about the throwing him away but she's not crying now because the brain unravels comes together having made a different meaning from the story in a story that she/they/he no

waking up I can't find my glasses[^G] and i can barely see without them but i lift up my skirt which lies on the piano and underneath (colourful enough in contrast to the black and white) there is a clementine 




hungrily inside it i bite into the skin, impatient, i don't like getting pith under my fingernails and so i bite with my incisors- hungrily 



this whole thing was written in two places which were the two spools of a reel to reel machine threaded with a mobius loop which only has one side:
1. three alters who from godless made 
2. an altar to the goddess changed me to^

now again back then at my altar surrounding my temple, i open my blind and looking to my left I realise my collection of pens both still functional and put back haphazardly useless and dry in the shadow of my light still on the floor inside a cube shaped cage is made from these writing implements the shape of an Outstretched Hand as in OH! as in going round in circles leading to

timer[^2] --remit[^1]

(Mis)erably, (en)dlessly, (aby)s(m)ally, in(e)vitable time passes and collapses onto me violently-

I wanted to go out to the trees and worship, but after writing furiously all day, the timer certainly not moving at any snail's pace, but rather like that great mystery of its shell's curvature, or your love, indescribable in the way it just never comes back again, or maybe (as I know in a more paradoxical, and therefore truer sense) it was never here to begin with, never able to be caught, never reaching an unknown, yet projected future trajectory; never obtaining a point in illusory time at one equally delusive time so desired in hopelessly elusive and hopeful delusion. I am tired and feel my fruitless grief beginning to wash over me again like the involuntary contraction of bowels, equally embarrassing yet I have no other from whom to perceive myself as embarrassing through relation as a mirror. Or, rather, I have exactly the same amount of company as I did for most of the time it was appropriate for me to ask for yours. This reminds me of the now-waning moon that I can no longer see from my window; so I move to my bedroom where I see the triple goddess at the doorway of the library once more, this time manifest as three young male mortal forms, all of whom face one another in the same triangle as those older, worn figures I felt moved to bring a humble offering of Halloween donuts to. They are standing, not sitting; they, as they always have, terrify me.

I stop writing and stay inside this room where it is warm. It is thick and thronged with mirrors.

The noun dates from the early 20th century.

[^3]: CASE: From Latin _casus_ (“fall”)[^F]  via Old French. A “case” signifies something that has “fallen” into place, requiring attention or containment. In typography, linguistics and/or computer science, 'case' refers to Letter case,  In law, it’s a set of facts for judgment (e.g., court case); in medicine, an individual needing care (e.g., a cancer case); in grammar, it indicates relational form (e.g., nominative case); and physically, it’s a container (e.g., suitcase) protecting its contents from external forces. Each sense holds or frames something that has landed, ready to be understood. The concept of _letter case_ originates from the physical _cases_ used in traditional letterpress printing. In this system, capital letters were stored in the upper drawers or “upper cases” of a type cabinet, while smaller letters were stored in lower drawers, the “lower cases.” This layout led to the terms _uppercase_ and _lowercase_ letters. Uppercase letters are typically used to start sentences or proper nouns, while lowercase is more common in continuous text for readability.
Upper- and lowercase letters may vary only in size (e.g., _C/c_) or in shape (e.g., _A/a_). This distinction is found in scripts such as Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic (bicameral scripts), while many scripts, like Hebrew or Arabic, are _unicase_, using one consistent letter form. Conventions for capitalization vary by language, with some, like English, capitalizing the start of sentences and proper nouns, and others, like German, capitalizing all nouns.

In programming, naming conventions reflect case distinctions to enhance code readability and maintain consistency. Examples include:

  

• **camelCase**: Words are joined without spaces; each new word starts with a capital except the first (e.g., _myVariableName_).

• **PascalCase**: Each word starts with a capital (e.g., _MyVariableName_).

• **snake_case**: Words are separated by underscores (e.g., _my_variable_name_).

• **kebab-case**: Words are separated by hyphens (e.g., _my-variable-name_).

  

These styles make code clearer by visually distinguishing elements, much like letter case aids readability in text.

  

In programming, _syntactic sugar_ refers to syntax added for readability that doesn’t change functionality. This “sugar” is often removed during _compilation_ through a process called _de-sugaring_ or _lowering,_ in which complex expressions are converted into simpler code for the compiler. Lowering parallels lowercase in text: both simplify and standardize for readability and processing, reducing form to a foundational, utilitarian level.

[^F]: “Fall” can imply either a severing—in one case, a fall from grace, a loss, something drifting (away) from—or in the other case, a convergence, a falling (toward) into place, where scattered pieces align, finding purpose in arrival. Each case of 'case', then, is a moment[^M] suspended between rupture and resolution, drawn toward what it relates to—whether it moves away, slipping from the Allness into memory, or toward, drawn by gravity to settle into meaning. This is perfectly encapsulated in the Americanism of Autumn as "Fall", which is alone is ruin, but when considered as part of the whole[^S] , can be seen as death springing into new life. Any-case, I digress [^D]

[^D]: to move away from the main subject you are writing or talking about and to write or talk about something else, indicating that you are trying to get back to what you've moved away from for a moment[^M]

[^M]: In time, a “moment” is fleeting—a brief period, an exact point, an opportunity, or a critical stage, as in “the moment they met” or “one of the great moments in history.” It also marks present focus (_in the moment_), living without future concern (_live for the moment_), or anticipating change (_at any moment_). In (un/im)portance, moment denotes significance, whether profoundly fleeting but everlasting in memory (_moment of truth_, a test or crisis) or a fleetingly forgettable trend (_of the moment_). In physics, moment signifies the turning, rotational effect of a force, calculated as force multiplied by distance. 
Statistically, moments express data patterns: the first as mean, second as variance, third as skew, and fourth as kurtosis.
Phrases like _not for a moment_ (“I will never, not for a moment, allow anybody to abuse me again”), _share a moment_ ("we shared a moment of loving embrace like a single ligature of two characters[^C] or letters in the text of a volume in the infinite library of timeless existence"), and _for the moment_ (temporarily, right now to an indeterminable point in the so-called future: "for the moment, I will stay silent on the matter, and allow the answers to unveil themselves in time") reflect the term’s duality, itself a measurement of a moment of a moment of a moment

[^S]: Synecdoche is a literary and linguistic device[^De] where a part of something represents the whole, or vice versa. It’s an expression of the paradox of reality - unity through separation, or solve et coagula; allowing the entirety of an idea or object to be grasped through one piece, much like a fractal where the whole is contained in each part. For instance, referring to “hands”[^H] to mean “workers” captures the essence of human contribution through a single, physical part. This notion reflects a deeper spiritual truth—each “part” embodies the whole, suggesting that each act, each person, and each detail is a complete expression of a vast, interconnected reality

[^De]: device | dɪˈvʌɪs | noun 1 a thing made or adapted for a particular purpose, especially a piece of mechanical or electronic equipment: a measuring device. • a bomb or other explosive weapon: an incendiary device. • a piece of portable electronic equipment that can connect to the internet, such as a smartphone, tablet, or laptop computer: a service that attempts to make all of your files available on all your devices whenever you want them | "simply connect your device to a power outlet as well as Wi-Fi" or "Forget This Device". a plan, method, scheme or trick with a particular aim: writing a letter to a newspaper is a traditional device for signalling dissent. • a form of words intended to produce a particular effect in speech or a literary work: a rhetorical device. 3 a drawing or design: the decorative device on the invitations. • an emblematic or heraldic design: their shields bear the device of the Blazing Sun. • archaic the design or look of something: works of strange device. to leave someone to their own devices is to leave someone to do as they wish without supervision: left to her own devices, Callie conducted rituals which got out of hand and almost culminated in unintentionally burning down her flat. Middle English: from Old French devis, based on Latin divis- ‘divided’, from the verb dividere. The original sense was ‘desire or intention’, found now only in leave someone to their own devices - to separate them from yourself, which is a device for them to find they own way back, not really back, but returned to a self-similar moment[^M] necessarily changed. All truths may only be found in the unified paradox of the fractal 

[^G]: (*as in glass-es as in glass-go as in see-through-him as in invisibility enables usefulness as in the lack of god in everything is goddess as in a fire engine just flickered its blueness into my right eye and I looked out the tiny crack of wintering light caressing my half ajar pickle jar eye lid and i see a pigeon )*
[^H]: which is a capital I rotated 90 degrees gives five letters which can make mitre which is a perpendicular meeting of two at the same number of degrees the H was rotated or the shell of a fibonacci spiral shelled mollusc resembling the hat of a bishop which is a chess piece
