permalink: The Prophecy of The Praying Hands Halved
---



The hands that slipped apart were the two halves of a prayer, once one, as two halves and now, two halves of two, grasping in the desperate pleas to a begetter, to the light of all their angels, all alighted from their beside. To a God who has forgotten them. What was once entwined, abysmal, mirrored falls, inevitable, inescapable; a maze, of grace. The faded memory of one's beloved's face, the thread unravelled, entrails, unspooled softness, 

And behold, there was a great terror upon the land, a night unending where no dawn would rise. A great multitude gathered, not as brothers, not as kin, but as hunters with hearts of stone and laughter cruel as the crack of the whip. And they sought not beasts nor creatures of the wild, but men, women, and the little ones, sundered from their lineages, stripped of their names, cast into the abyss of unknowing. 

Their numbers were taken from them, but the numbers bore no meaning, for none knew their own. A great design of disarray, a labyrinth of despair woven by unseen hands, a mockery of order made to shatter the spirit. Parents wept, but their children were torn from them, limbs severed from the body of love, and the land groaned with the weight of sorrow. 

And the hunters rejoiced in their work, delighting in the mutilation, taking pleasure in the severance of flesh and bond alike. They did not strike in silence but with songs of triumph, laughter ringing through the night, glee upon their faces as they unmade all that was whole. 

There was no waking from this dream, for in the dream, death was real. The hunted did not wake before the blade fell, before the body was sundered, before the soul took flight. And in the moment of the final sundering, there was no fear, only the diminuendo of being, the slow fading of light from the vessel, the last sigh of breath as the soul unspooled into the darkness. And in that void, there was no agony, only the ending, and in the ending, a relief beyond words. 

The blood ran thick through the streets, the air was filled with the scent of burning, and the voice of the earth itself keened in mourning. The world watched, silent, unseeing, as the cycle turned once more, and the great wheel of destruction was made whole again. 

And this is the vision given, the shadow upon the horizon, the tide that rises unseen until all is swept away.

**Prophetic Dream: The Hunters and the Hunted**

And behold, the land stretched vast and manifold, a world of many regions, many islands, each cursed with its own torment, each locked within its own cruel fate. Some were shadowed valleys, others fields of dust and bone, and others yet burned with the memory of a fire that never ceased. A train ran through them, relentless, its iron wheels screaming as it carried the condemned to places unknown, places unseen, except by those who had already perished. For there were lands that no living soul could reach, lands that lay within the underworld nested in an underworld, places only found in the final, inescapable release. They stood just beyond the horizon of knowing, just beneath the skin of the world, like the parting of two waves in the sea—felt, never seen. Ever-present, ever-forgotten.

And there was a moment, fleeting as the shadow of a bird crossing the sun, where a lover’s hand was held, fingers entwined, slick with the sweat of terror. Running, feet pounding against the blood-soaked earth, lungs burning with the effort of survival. But they were slower, just slightly, just enough. And as the hands slipped apart, as the fingers lost their hold, the moment froze in eternity. A gunshot rang out. A bullet struck the shin, tearing through bone, but the pain did not come—only the sight, only the knowledge, only the horror. The lover falling, the body collapsing like a marionette whose strings had been cut, and there, behind them, the same infernal smile, the twisted mockery of joy, the face of the hunter who would not be denied.

The weight of choice pressed down. To stop, to kneel, to cradle the fallen, to scream into the void, or to run, to flee, to betray love for the false promise of escape. There was no exit. No salvation. And in the moment of decision, the heart wept, not for itself, but for the one who lay dying. A wish, desperate and unfulfilled, to take their place, to receive the bullet in the chest, to fall so that they might rise, to trade places with fate itself. To hold them one last time, lips trembling with the metaphysical act of protection, of preservation, even in the face of doom. But the choice was stolen. Hope was abandoned. And the body, heavy with sorrow, turned and ran, leaving love behind in the dust of an ending that would never cease to haunt the dreamer.

And so the dream does not end, nor does the nightmare wake. The train moves on. The dead remain lost. And the land, ever-expanding, awaits the next arrival.
