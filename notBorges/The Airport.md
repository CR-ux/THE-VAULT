I do not know why or how I awake here, I dream here -
They are not dreams they are scattered injustices of sweetly alighted memory
Fuelled, heavy again - 

Promising passengers, balancing the weight of their collective tissue; 
Tapestry, aqueduct -
The airport welcomes no-one, but all of my Hanger Selves 
Aborted in a darkened alley, splayed, delayed
I have never there seen an aircraft; I suspect they do not exist 
Or are too dwarfed in size by the building
to be brave enough to roll in with their naive wheels 


this must be where all the unspeakable poetry goes 
or ends up or comes from 
it must be
