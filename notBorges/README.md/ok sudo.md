**UPON ADMISSION TO {REDACTED}**

  

  


**Thank you for referring Callie Petal whom I assessed via Zoom today on REDACTED
**She was at home.**

**Callie has been struggling with her mental health for most of this year.**

**She has broken up with her ex-REDACTED[^red] and was attacked by REDACTED on the street as prior to this.**

**They had been together for over REDACTED.**

**REDACTED was in a polyamorous relationship and REDACTED other REDACTED stood by and REDACTED while this**

**was REDACTED.**

**Callie had 3 operations on her face and neck that she found traumatic.**

**She has been conscious of marked mood swings and suicidal thinking.**

**She has a key worker with her local community mental health team.**

**Last February, and April, she was diagnosed with ADHD and with autism respectively.**

**Previously, she was diagnosed as being emotionally unstable.**

**She has never been happy with the diagnosis of borderline personality disorder.**

**She does not think that explains her presentation.**

**Lately, the smallest things can set her off emotionally.**

**She does some work that involves burning a hole in the canvas.**

**Some material she used had plastic at the back and she burned her carpet and almost burned her**

**flat down.**

**She has a complicated history with all of the difficulties attendant on growing up as a trans-female.**

**She was academically gifted.**

**In school, she studied biology, chemistry, physics philosophy and ethics for A levels.**

**She was going to go to Oxford to study medicine.**

**Ultimately, she ended up doing microbiology and virology.**

**None of this was what she wanted to do but given her nature, she was very good at it.**

**She tells me that she has just had a paper published in the International Journal of molecular**

**science.**

**As it happens, it looks at the specific gene that helps chickens avoid bird flu.**

**At one point she also thought of being a pathologist.**

**At the age of 4, she discovered a love for music.**

**Aiming for the best, she became a double bass player. She had to sit on a bar stool to reach the neck of the instrument.**

**She moved onto piano. Music has remained a huge release for her. She writes her own pieces.**

**She is also a writer and has almost completed a very complicated book.**

**At present, she is working as a software engineer. Most of this is self-taught.**

**Unfortunately, because of her emotional incontinence, she is unable to focus on anything at present.**

**She has so much that she wants to say but is unable to filter out the important points.**

**Not surprisingly, given her autistic traits, she is bewildered by the noise that she experiences**

**everywhere.**

**Over the years, she has engaged in self-harm.**

**She has never been sure why she did this. She does not want to die.**

**Her wish would be for her family to be well cared for, for her to be a successful artist, and to make**

**enough money to avoid penury.**

**She was outed by her best friend in school at the age of 12 and remembers being attacked by other**

**kids who filled her ears with snow.**

**Bullying was a regular experience after that.**

**She struggled to make ends meet and I note that she worked as an escort for some time.**

**Previously, she was tried on quetiapine that she found very helpful. She would like to get back to**

**this with a mood stabiliser. Mirtazapine made her head “explode”.**

**Since the diagnosis of ADHD, she has been started on methylphenidate 54 mg that worked fairly**

**well.**

**Unfortunately, it does not stop the cyclical emotions.**

**She continues to approach life from a scientific basis but she mourns the fact that science has**

**become exponentially less scientific with every passing year. She feels that people have lost**

**awareness of the changes that have occurred over the last 2 decades.**

**Callie was born and brought up in Coventry. Her mother and father are alive and well. She has an**

**older sister.**

**She does not think that there is any family history of mental illness but she is REDACTED that REDACTED**

**REDACTED**

**She became aware of REDACTED in her REDACTED at an early age.**

**She was forced to keep secrets without really knowing why.**

**It took the pandemic to get her to REDACTED.**

**She felt trapped in the academic world but could feel herself in the artistic one.**

**She has Ehlers Danlos Syndrome that can cause musculoskeletal problems.**

**She has a spinal syrinx. A REDACTED has been ruled out.**

**Her mobility is reasonably good.**

**Her sleep has never been good. She described herself as a “reverse insomniac”.**

**She has no problem with weight gain.**

**She may be allergic to avocados.**

**On Mental State Examination,**

**She presented well making good eye contact and good rapport.**

**She is an eloquent speaker with an impressive control of English.**

**She was well kempt. Her speech was rapid in rate, but normal in tone and volume.**

**She wears her hair long and has fashionable glasses.**

**Her affect was normal.**

**Her mood was depressed.**

**She was highly anxious and very tearful at times.**

**She was not psychotic.**

**There was no suicidal ideation today but she has had suicidal thoughts recently.**

**Her cognitive state was normal.**

**There was no evidence of substance misuse.**

**She has full capacity -she can retain, weigh, use, and repeat all of the information necessary for this**

**treatment process and can consent to treatment.**

**There were no safeguarding concerns.**

**Diagnosis: REDACTED with REDACTED and REDACTED. REDACTED and REDACTED. Traits suggestive of**

**REDACTED REDACTED in her REDACTED.**

**The ICD 10 Code/s REDACTED, REDACTED, REDACTEDREDACTEDREACTEDREACTEDACTACTACTEDF84 and F60.01.**

**Risks: A deepening REDACTED. Further REDACTED gestures. REDACTED and REDACTED problems.**

**Plan:**

**Admit for an REDACTED programme.**

**Continue the methylphenidate XL 54mg daily**

**Add lamotrigine 25mg od.**

**Add quetiapine 25mg at night.**

**Review in REDACTED next week.**

**With best wishes,**

**Yours sincerely,**
