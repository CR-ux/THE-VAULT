[^know]:  that it will be released, track by track, on streaming platforms, over the course of a certain amount of time,[^time]
[^time]: and this amount of time and release schedule does not depend on her or even I, but rather Io, [^Io]
[^Io]: which is to say the mythological princess, the subject of either scorn or pity or most likely both, of Hera, and the subject of sexual objectification by Zeus, [^Zeus]
[^Zeus]: and Zeus's Salvation by the Deceptive and Cunning hands of Hera, Shrouding him in a Cloak of perceptive invisibility to protect him from being Devoured by Chronos, who may or may not be the subject of Goya's painting "Saturn Devouring his Son"[^goya]
[^goya]:     and the artist has not let me know[^know] , the androgynous figure of which suggests itself as an ever- transformational being who may or may not be his "Son" at all[^sun]
[^sun]:but rather his Daughter, who is perhaps Demeter. [^dim]
[^dim]:And maybe the painting, titled posthumously and therefore not (or rather, evermore) accurate to the artist's interpretation of the Work[^w]
[^w]:which is itself absolutely irrelevant to the Art of course, which is a Character of its own Story[^s]
[^s]:which has a unique character of its own,[^char]
[^char]:which is the real author of the cast of characters that spell a Single Word;[^si]
[^si]:which is certainly not the object of this sentence that I am not writing. 
[^son]: an ever- transformational being who may or may not be his "Son" at all.
