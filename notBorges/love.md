lexDef (Centromere) "Love" {lexAllele(s)::: Wyrb} < To Forgive.[^LoveWyrb]

[^LoveWyrb]: I love everyone, and I mean that in the most sincere way possible, although I don’t know how to make it sound that way. it is blithe, yes, but I think that’s the point: I believe fervently in my right to be unguarded with my love, to give it away at the drop of a hat. I am loving loving loving and it taxes me nothing. love should feed you, don’t forget", A, for Adrian.
