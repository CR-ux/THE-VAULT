- [[Two lexDefs of the lexDict, and the Crushing Edge of Infinity]], addenda of [['to forgive the characters'. a lexicomythographic prodverb]]


The resulting con{e{s(u)|do}lang(u){age(i)}s of the lexDict, namely Edo||odE and SIPHO{N|r}, are derived from the above formula. 
These languages are highly specialised forms of communication, designed to condense sentiment into so-called 'one-liners'.[^1]




Thus Never Spake Borges;


"All Stories, Letters, Are Endless Libraries`
`"HexiDewey Decimal Placeholding, Searching For"`
`"The Meaning of that most unthinkable memory, Or"`
`"This story, all stories, created and made up of Just a Single Character"`
`The Writing of the Story is An Unforgotten Door.` 
`And letters within envelopes in stories dropped, spilled, poured 
`into` the hearts of History's children`
`All the Stories flickered through all fire-dancing families of Yore` 
`And the need for separation from Our Undeniably Circular Source.` 

`Of this, I've never been more sure:`
`"A Story is a Memory Oar"`
