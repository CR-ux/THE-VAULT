[I am a multidisciplinary artist, composer, and writer working under the evolving moniker notBorges. My practice is durational, recursive, and transmedia: a lifelong project exploring language, trauma, divinity, neurodivergence, queerness, and survival through poetic systems that loop and refract.

To date, I’ve written over two million words within this mythic universe — a body of text, audio, manuscript, and code spread across interlinked websites, music releases, hand-bound books, and redacted archives. My work draws from literary traditions (Borges, Calvino, Blake) but is fundamentally rooted in lived experience, shaped by psychiatric institutionalisation, disability, and gender-based violence.

I was a Resident Entrepreneur with Creative Informatics, receiving £12,000 to develop a recursive storytelling app that evolved into this project and launched my career as a software engineer. I received £3,000 from Help Musicians UK for KATABASIS: An Underworld Opera, released on vinyl/cassette under my musical moniker lonely carp — an experimental work exploring psychosis, queerness, and descent.

I am the subject, composer, and sound designer of the documentary What It Means to Be, directed by Lea Luiz de Oliveira. The film, awarded Best Short Documentary at the Kashish International Film Festival, screened internationally and featured in multiple Q&As.

I co-founded Spit It Out, a collective using creative expression to support recovery from trauma and sexual violence.

In 2024, after a premature psychiatric discharge, I covered my walls with painted murals — a ritual of survival. Facing forced redaction, their documentation will become part of a larger archive and gallery installation: The Entry Room, a hexagonal space housing future artist salons.

My current album Xˡibris (forthcoming on Venalism) and the booksafe manuscript of The Children’s Gospel Music Songbook are the first tangible artefacts of this phase. I’ve also sustained a loyal Patreon community for over six years.](<[I am a multidisciplinary artist, composer, and writer working under the evolving moniker notBorges.

My practice is durational, recursive, and transmedia: a lifelong project that explores language, trauma, divinity, neurodivergence, queerness, and survival through poetic systems that loop and refract.

  

To date, I have written over **two million words** within this mythic universe — a growing body of text, audio, manuscript, and code distributed across interlinked websites, musical releases, hand-bound books, and redacted archives. My work draws from literary tradition (Borges, Calvino, Blake), but is fundamentally driven by lived experience: surviving psychiatric institutionalisation, navigating disability, and processing gender-based violence.

  

I was a **Resident Entrepreneur** with [**Creative Informatics**](https://creativeinformatics.org/case-study-article/a-transformational-time-how-being-a-resident-entrepreneur-set-callie-rose-petal-on-a-brand-new-career-path/), where I received **£12,000 in support** to develop a storytelling app that laid the foundations of this current phase of my work. That experience launched my career as a software engineer — and eventually evolved into _The Children’s Gospel Music Songbook_.

  

I also received **£3,000 from Help Musicians UK** through their Do It Differently fund for the creation of _KATABASIS: An Underworld Opera_, released on vinyl and cassette under my musical moniker **lonely carp**. That record, now folded into the broader _notBorges_ mythology, was an experimental work of sonic ritual — exploring psychosis, queerness, and descent.

  

I am the subject, composer, and sound designer of the documentary _What It Means to Be_, directed by Lea Luiz de Oliveira. The film, which explores my life, music, and creative process, screened internationally and was awarded **Best Short Documentary at the Kashish International Film Festival**, with appearances at multiple festivals and Q&As.

Alongside this, I was a founding member of **Spit It Out**, a collective and charity focused on creative recovery from trauma and sexual violence. Together, we built spaces for expression, solidarity, and healing through art.

  

Following a premature discharge from psychiatric care in 2023, I returned home and painted murals across my walls — a ritual of survival and reclamation. These murals, now facing forced redaction, became the visual root system of _The Children’s Gospel Music Songbook_. Their documentation will form the basis of an **archive**, and eventually reappear in the form of a **physical hexagonal gallery space**: The Entry Room.

  

My work operates like **literary mycelium** — an underground lattice of meaning, where visible artefacts (cassettes, manuscripts, installations) emerge from a deeper system of linked texts, footnotes, lexicons, sound, and ritual. It is a world that rewards recursive attention.

  

My current album, _Xˡibris_ (to be released under **Venalism**), and the accompanying **booksafe manuscript**, represent the first tangible fruits of this phase. I have also sustained a modest but consistent **Patreon community** for over six years, currently contributing **£52/month**, demonstrating long-term audience engagement.

  

Looking ahead, this funding will allow me to:

• Produce the first editioned works (tape + manuscript)

• Launch the _Gospel Songtrail_ ARG

• Create the first physical **Entry Room**

• And initiate a series of artist salons — not curated, but **invited**: a community space to fight loneliness through collaborative ritual

  

This application is not the beginning of my work.

It is the moment of its **material flowering**.%3E)%3E)>)
