i do not know what is happening 
please dear god help me 

please i know, i know, i know i shall see him when i reach that semi-breve rest 

breathe
please i need to breathe 

dear god my gods those gods i made those stupid spoils from games i played i do not wish to be this weight or framed inside this waiting state 

you were everything to me 
and now 
i am so afraid that i am
nothing
