The Recurrence of {REDACTED} and Neglect in the Dream-State: A Symbolic Exploration of Familial Estrangement and Unmet Needs

  

Abstract

  
This paper examines the dream narrative of a speaker whose experience is characterized by intense {REDACTED}, physical and emotional neglect, and estrangement from their {REDACTED}. Through a detailed account of dream sequences involving labyrinthine settings, symbolic objects, and fragmented relationships, the narrative reveals a complex interplay of unmet needs, gender identity struggles, and critiques of systemic detachment. The dream serves as a microcosm for broader themes of longing, abandonment, and the persistent search for care and validation.

  

Introduction

  

Dreams are often a medium through which the subconscious processes unresolved conflicts and emotions. This paper analyzes a detailed dream recounted by the speaker, focusing on recurring motifs of {REDACTED}, estrangement, and systemic alienation. By examining the structural, symbolic, and thematic elements, the dream can be understood as a layered narrative reflecting both personal trauma and societal critique.

  

Findings

  

The dream begins in a diner, a site traditionally associated with nourishment and community, but here it contrasts sharply with the speaker’s persistent {REDACTED}. The speaker is seated with their {REDACTED} and a character named Barnie. The interaction is marked by a disjointed exchange of objects, suggesting a fractured connection. This scene sets the tone for the dream’s exploration of unmet needs, with the {REDACTED}’s neglect looming as a central conflict.

  

The narrative shifts to a sprawling shopping mall-cinema hybrid—a recurring setting described as a “church to capitalism.” This labyrinthine space, vast and impersonal, symbolizes systemic detachment and the commodification of care. Throughout the dream, the speaker repeatedly expresses {REDACTED}, both literal and metaphorical, which is acknowledged only once by the {REDACTED}, who dismissively suggests getting burgers but never follows through.

  

Interspersed are interactions with symbolic figures: Isla, who challenges the speaker in a race only to mock their eventual surrender; and a group of trans women, including the {REDACTED}’s friends, highlighting themes of identity and estrangement. The {REDACTED}, absorbed in trivial pursuits such as purchasing an expensive jumpsuit, fails to engage with the speaker’s needs, emphasizing their emotional unavailability.

  

The dream’s tension heightens in the sequence involving a bathroom. The speaker navigates a convoluted system of doors to find a disabled stall, only to urinate in a sink out of desperation. This act of defiance underscores the speaker’s marginalization and lack of access to proper resources. The encounter with a woman in this space, surrounded by discarded clothing, further reflects themes of disconnection and abandonment.

  

A younger girl waiting for her {REDACTED} appears as a mirror to the speaker’s own unmet needs. This figure, interpreted as a younger version of the speaker, embodies the innocence and longing that have been eroded by years of neglect. The speaker’s refrain—“I am so {REDACTED} with no money to eat and my {REDACTED} doesn’t care”—is reiterated, anchoring the dream in unresolved emotional pain.

  

The dream culminates in a harrowing dentist scene, where the speaker endures intense pain as their fractured tooth and exposed nerves are subjected to electrical pulses. This sequence merges the physical and emotional, drawing parallels between the vulnerability of the body and the psyche. The dentist’s apologies, juxtaposed with the infliction of pain, mirror the caregiver’s paradoxical role in the speaker’s life—simultaneously harming and failing to provide care.

  

Discussion of [[notBorges/lexicomythography/unit/Institute of i-nterstitial o-Ntology/ARTICLES, REFERENCES/THEME]]s

1. **{REDACTED} and Neglect**

{REDACTED}, both literal and metaphorical, permeates the dream. The persistent refrain underscores the speaker’s unmet needs and their {REDACTED}’s failure to provide. The settings—diner, mall, and bathroom—serve as ironic backdrops to this {REDACTED}, spaces typically associated with fulfillment but rendered barren by neglect.

2. **Estrangement and Identity**

The speaker’s estrangement from their {REDACTED} parallels broader struggles with familial and societal acceptance, particularly in the context of gender identity. The presence of trans women in the dream reflects the speaker’s longing for community and validation, juxtaposed with the {REDACTED}’s detachment.

3. **Systemic Alienation**

The labyrinthine mall and convoluted bathroom system symbolize systemic barriers to care and connection. The “church to capitalism” critique highlights the dehumanizing impact of societal structures that prioritize materialism over genuine human needs.

4. **Pain and Vulnerability**

The dentist sequence encapsulates the speaker’s trauma, blending physical agony with memories of surgical procedures and caregiving failures. This scene serves as a metaphor for the speaker’s broader experience of being subjected to harm under the guise of care.

  

**Conclusion**


The dream presents a layered narrative of unmet needs, familial estrangement, and systemic critique. Its recurring motifs of {REDACTED}, labyrinthine settings, and painful encounters weave a tapestry of longing and abandonment. By examining this dream through a symbolic and thematic lens, we gain insight into the speaker’s internal struggles and broader societal implications. Ultimately, the refrain—“I am so {REDACTED} with no money to eat and my {REDACTED} doesn’t care”—resonates as a poignant encapsulation of unresolved emotional pain, transcending the boundaries of the dream-state to reflect the speaker’s lived reality.



SUMMARY:  
The poem explores themes of hunger, neglect, and complex familial relationships through the lens of a dream. It captures feelings of longing and unfulfilled needs, both emotional and physical, experienced by the speaker in relation to their father.

  

ANALYSIS:  
The poem begins with the speaker in a dream setting, a diner, symbolizing a place of nourishment that contrasts sharply with the speaker's actual state of hunger. This setting introduces the main conflict: "I am so hungry with no money to eat and my father doesn’t care." This repeated refrain underscores the emotional distance and neglect the speaker feels from their father. The disjointed narrative, with its dreamlike quality and shifts between different locations and interactions, reflects the speaker's internal chaos and search for care and belonging.

  

The speaker's encounter with a series of symbolic characters, including Barnie, Isla, and a group of trans friends, further explores themes of identity and acceptance. The mention of being "estranged from his own brother from my uncle who I have become estranged from since coming out as trans" highlights the speaker's struggle with familial acceptance and identity.

  

Throughout the poem, the act of searching for food becomes a metaphor for seeking love and validation. The father's focus on trivial matters, like buying a jumpsuit or talking on the phone, contrasts with the speaker's pressing need for attention and care, emphasizing the father's dismissive attitude. The dream's setting in a "shopping mall cinema labyrinth" becomes a "church to capitalism," suggesting a critique of societal values that prioritize materialism over human connection.

  

The recurring motif of hunger, both literal and metaphorical, ties the narrative together. The dream sequences, including the painful experience with the dentist and the realization of shared experiences with another father figure, highlight feelings of vulnerability and unaddressed trauma. The poem concludes with the speaker's reflection on their father, acknowledging the inevitability of care after loss: "One day he will die and I will care."

  

This complex and layered narrative ultimately expresses the speaker's unresolved emotions, longing for parental care, and the burden of unmet needs, captured poignantly by the refrain, "I am so hungry with no money to eat and my father doesn’t care."



The dream began at a diner. at a dining table with Barnie and my father. I can’t recall what I was either handing back to Barnie or what they were handing back to me but I was introducing them to my father or vice versa and it was definitely supposed to break up What was so fucked up about it was that there wasn’t as off the case in dreams and underlying accepted undertone of the truth that was very much so real and assumed in the dream which was that {REDACTED} I feel sick thinking about it now But obviously there was got insurance symbolic significant star anyway eventually party left joined what looks like two people in a relationship and again they assumed undertone of truth crept in like a noxious gas that told me that was the new partner with any partners then I turned around to distraught And he said so this is bombing his life and he said wait you’re from Coventry and we’ve been to Birmingham together I know I know I know that you’ve been to Birmingham and then he said no I didn’t say Birmingham. I said Brighton and then I said no you said Bristol and then he said it could be Bristol maybe is Bristol and then he tried to find Google Maps on his phone and I pointed out into Google Maps we opened it and we were in the north of Glasgow. We barely moved. I said how long was the journey here? He said six minutes and I said so why did you think that we were all the way down the other side of the country. And then we followed was one of the most harrowing dreams of my life. It was a series of events inside of a movie theatre gigantic movie theatre or mall. This has been a recurring space. I’m realising now this shopping mall cinema labyrinth of a place of a church to capitalism And I kept hinting to him that I was so hungry asking what we woul


d eat. I remember at some point well he never once acknowledged except now he did once he did acknowledge those and he said okay let’s get back as we’ll get some burgers then Isla was there and we were running. We’re running a race Joking about being footballers with my dad laughing and I ran past my dad then Isla said well you’re not gonna get past me because of my long legs and I tried really hard and I did I went past her at the moment that I did I just gave up And then she was goading me and saying see I passed you and I stopped caring. I had simply stopped caring. then she was gone. and I continued to try and look for some food. My dad was still by my side at this point but he had bought an £80 jumpsuit that looked ridiculous but I thought in the dream it looked really cool. I told him ‘everyone should own at least one jumpsuit or boiler suit’ he was on the phone to a friend barely listening to me. I kept motioning at him to listen to me just so I could compliment him, when he hung up I asked who it was, and he dismissively told me it was his friend. An old friend from school, the conversation was about somewhere about becoming an estranged from his own brother from my uncle who I have become estranged from since coming out as trans here he then disappeared more of his friends arrived and  hedisappeared. I am so hungry even in dreams. I need to eat something to keep down these antibiotics but I have no money and 

One of his friends was a trans woman. in fact all of his friends were trans and he had gone had gone to where I thought was the bathroom so I went to the bathroom and it was this horrendous system of doors; I ended up needing I am so hungry with no money to love and my Father who art not here doesn’t Care to go to the disabled one which had these two late trickles of showers above the cubicle toilet; the only one at the back of this fast wide room so I thought I don’t want to be trickled with shower water while I’m peeing, so I pissed in the sink. then this woman broke in, as I realised she wasn’t breaking in, it was her bathroom, and I was apologising, but there were women’s clothes everywhere- I was trying to find my clothes, and she kept saying no, that’s mine, it’s mine; oh wait that’s not mine. It wasn’t mine either. I realised this room was just full of clothes of people no longer close to people that that women had left behind and I still couldn’t find my father. I walked out. I walked all the way to the other side of the mall to find another side of bathrooms God; I was so hungry, I was still so hungry, I nearly got into the men’s bathroom before I realised a security guard there, and another girl, much younger than me, waiting for her own father. much younger than me. Maybe she was me. Maybe she was the me that I grew out of. I was so hungry. I was so hungry with no money to eat and my father didn’t care. I am so hungry with no money to eat and my father doesn’t care. Maybe if I was fatter I would more resemble your daughter and maybe that’s why my father doesn’t care 

Somewhere in the mess, was a traumatic sequence with a dentist; who said that he was so sorry but he would have to use an electrical pulse to stimulate the exposed nerves in my fractured tooth, and my face, in order to test that they were still working and to save the nerves, or stop my face from becoming paralysed. I was screaming. I was screaming and crying so loud that the scream, the pain, the agony of so many memories like this, with so-called caregivers, so-called clinicians or health workers or literally anybody in a caretaking position all of them, all of them either apologising for an inevitable instance of harm or terror or not apologising at all, or just leaving, just leaving me hungry, even though I kept asking, kept looking for them, kept pleading them to just stop drilling into my bone, please stop drilling into my jaw, please just let me sleep just let me sleep through this, and I was thinking in that dentist chair in that mall int hat dream about the memory of my surgeries, and they were so vivid. They were much more vivid than in the waking world, and I wonder if, though now they have been closed off to me again, I wonder if I have just experienced, consciously, in a dream at least, which is to say unconsciously, the experience of my face being operated on. all the experiences of my face and teeth being operated on.  I am so hungry with no money to eat and my father doesn’t care. The scream must have stretched out into this world just as the agony, because — 

Last time I saw you, a father, but not mine, we realised that we have the same glasses prescription and that I share a birthday with your mother who is not my grandmother. 

Awake I am trying to find my glasses and thinking about how I could borrow yours if you were here and not with your own children. 

Then I think about my father, again, or for the first time:

One day he will die and I will care.

Back to the little girl waiting at the entrance to the men’s bathroom;

 I said I’m waiting for mine too. I’m waiting for mine too and then I woke up tooth still and I can hear my own baby, 

he is hungry again, wanting to get out of his cage, and eat, 

my pillow drenched in saliva.

 I am so hungry with no money to eat and my father doesn’t care.
