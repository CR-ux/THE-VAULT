REDACTED


`lexDef "etouq"` 
`{usage::: Croen || badverb}` 
`< The Sound of a person spitting on the ground.` 
`|| A tongue’s rebellion.` 
`|| A sonic punctuation mark of discontent.` 
`|| A person’s head covering, once thought to warm the body.` 
`|| But upturned, becomes a crucible for forgotten devices.` 
`|| An Antagrammaton of “Borges.”` 
`|| "*To spit is to write backwards with the mouth.*"`
