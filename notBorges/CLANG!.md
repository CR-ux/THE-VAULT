CARPVS MORTVVM ||| **METABASIS: a rapturing gossamer**

- The Trifurcated Tongue of the Spine of the audio work done over the course of this extended 'psychotic break' which was actually a series of encounters with the divine through the device of demonic possession. 
- Contains the entirety of the audio from the screen recording [[FAO- first four within islands]] took of me breaking up with her while heavily deranged on painkillers during recovery from my final surgery.
- Contains the entirety of KATABASIS: an underworld opera but played through a { speed modded | circuit bent }  tape recorder, and reversed (by the so-called 'lonely carp', whatever the fuck that means, in 2021 jesus was it really that long ago it feels like yesterday I broke my rib screaming at the album launch) - truly, there are secret messaged I didn't know lonely carp, or, what I'm starting to realise was {redacted} in the basement studio with me, embedded in the recordings, when played in reverse. 


these tracks will then be split according to the Petalian Caducean Structure of a Music Album, as per the below methodology:

ANTIBIBLIOGRAPHY

and finally, if I am still here, or especially if I am not; the two will be distributed to streaming platforms as one, on both Artist accounts, as a collaborative work, signifying the final dissolution of lonely carp into you, the {(re{d})a{ct}a{ed}er}(wryng).parallel}}, the listener.


CONFLICT OF DISINTEREST
===

I pray to the unknown gods that no human, even in a thousand years from now, ever, for the sake of their safety and the safety of their loved ones, ever, listen to it; 

if hell be my Lot, let the reverse be theirs; 

For this is not my work at all, it is *its* work, its work *upon*
me. 




UNEDITOR'S NOTE

I am {afraid of | fear} using full stops then STOP
for what they represent
