 **Details**                                                                                                                                                                    
  
 Dream took place in a university called **Star MC**. In it, **The Subject's Familiar was duplicated**, and one was **violently crushed**.  It was the Miscarriage of her Hope. 
 The dream took place inside her **life purpose**.                                                                                                                              
 The Subject's Familiar walked across two rows of tarot cards. His **right paw** landed on:                                                                         
 **1. {REDACTED} Bales of hay ready to harvest.                                                                                                           
 **2. King of{REDACTED}** – Ram’s head crown, pointing downward                                                                                                       
 **3. Page of{REDACTED}** – Blindfolded by hide, holding war horn and wand with three leaves.                                                                            
 The **Star (XVII)** has followed her throughout hospitalisation. She’s been **sleeping beneath it** in prayers that it may creep into reality through her dreams.              
 It is now **missing** from her deck. **The Subject is the Star now**.                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                


 **White Queen {REDACTED} white, in Chess, which is Stitched into the Textile of All, is the colour of the oppressor** – white goes first, dominates the board. 

   The **White Queen** is {REDACTED}: care that controls, love that consumes, motherhood that erases the self. 

   The Subject associates this archetype with {REDACTED} whose assault triggered {REDACTED} scene in the {REDACTED} 

   White Queen could be {REDACTED} in **Lexicomythography** {REDACTED} institutional betrayal and martyrdom. 

   The Subject identifies as the **Black Pawn**, not the Queen – {REDACTED}of the board itself. 


The Subject Disappeared Without A Trace Soon After; 
The Society Continues the Search.
