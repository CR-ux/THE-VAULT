Imagine six hexagons stuck together into a 3-Dimensional net, to form a cube with Six Hexagonal Faces. 
Now imagine all of these six hexagons are walls of a central Hospital room. 
Now imagine these walls boundary six Other Chambers, Each containing a Character. 
Each of these Characters awakes, not knowing their name, but 
On finding a different, single chess piece in their respective Chambers, 
assign themselves these Six Roles
Upon their StoryBoard. 

Top | The Queen
Bottom | The King.

From Bee's Eye View:
Northern Face  | Pawn
Western Face | Bishop
Eastern Face | Knight
Southern Face | Rook.


The Queen, being above all, is able to send notes to anyone through the Four Vents in her floor, plus the central Garbage Chute which runs down the central cube to the King's Chamber. 
The Four non-Royal pieces each have a vent on two of their walls, both valved to ensure their unidirectionality, one outward, one inward.

This creates a one-way system of communication through the four rooms, as well as a one way system of communication from the Queen. 

The King, having the largest chamber, but (as all the Others) no other objects therein of which to speak, other than the said, singular chess piece, and (as all the Others) a Calligraphy pen-syringe contraption, designed to draw blood with which to write, he could not reach his ceiling vent or send a message via the chute to the Queen due to the curse of Gravity, and therefore could only receive written correspondence, not send it. In order to communicate with the Others, the King would have to Speak, 
Which would mean he would be heard, 
Which could result in all manner of horrible things, 
Which would be a matter for the Woman in the Wallpaper to decide. 
Which would mean their Game was Over.
