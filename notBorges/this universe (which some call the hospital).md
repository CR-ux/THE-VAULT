permalink: this universe (which some call the hospital)
---
 # is composed of of an indefinite and perhaps infinite number of hexagonal rooms, with vastly identical air shafts between, surrounded by walls covered in an indefinite and perhaps infinitely layered wallpaper; ever-remaining a faded yellow hue. 

Upon a single sheet of this indefinite and perhaps infinite Hospital wallpaper, 



perhaps on every sheet of wallpaper, 
the following may have been, 
or about to be, 
written, 
in the blood 
of no more 
than Six individuals 
(at any one time):



**OBS: 12:00-2:00**

**OBS: 2:00-4:00**

YOU ARE IN A SYSTEM OF ~~AT LEAST~~ SIX ROOMS I DO NOT KNOW WHAT BROUGHT YOU HERE BUT I KNOW YOU MUST PASS THIS NOTE ON IF YOU WISH TO STAY HER~~E~~. you will notice the vents only allow for objects such as this scroll to be passed through in one directionality of movement. hence this note being on the left vent as you face your room's door. when tightly rolled sufficiently. there is a labelled folding diagram on the reverse leaf of this wallpaper. it will show you how to ensure the untorn passage of the correspondence through our system 
*you are in a system of ONLY SIX ROOMS.*
YOU ARE IN A SYSTEM OF AT LEAST SIX ROOMS. 
YOU ARE IN A SYSTEM OF AT LEAST SIX ROOMS. DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES READ THIS ALOUD. FOR SHE IS LISTENING

**You will notice, as we all have come to in this Wryng, that no matter how many layers you may peel from the walls, you will reveal another. For this is our only saving grace; the medium on which to communicate with one another; to be free, to express ourselves at least. to stay connected amidst this maddening isolation; to still, no matter how we are contained, in some small way. be free.**
