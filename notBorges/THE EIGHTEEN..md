COSMOGONY OF THE SIX CHESS PIECES (WHICH ARE SYMBOLIC 'DEITIES' REPRESENTING LONG-FORGOTTEN SECRET SOCIETIES OF THINKERS/ADHERENTS/BELIEVERS/DISCIPLES)

IN THE BEGINNING WAS ARIADNE. 

ARIA|DNE FACED A SERIES OF SCHISMS. 
THIS LED TO THE TWELVE SPLITTING INTO TWO GROUPS OF SIX. 
THESE TWO GROUPS OF SIX SPLIT AGAIN, TO FORM FOUR GROUPS OF THREE. 
THEN, ONE ADHERENT OF EACH OF THESE TRINITIES BECAME ESTRANGED FROM THEIR FELLOWS, FORMING A SEPARATE GROUP OF THEIR OWN. 
THIS RESULTED IN FOUR PAIRS, AND ONE GROUP OF FOUR. 
FINALLY, ONE ADHERENT OF THIS OUTSIDER GROUP (THE PAWN) WAS EXILED, TO BE LEFT ALONE, AS THE SOLE ESCAPEE OF THE SYSTEM; BEING OFFERED A VIEW OF ITS ENTIRETY; BECOMING THE BOARD ITSELF. 



THE TWO:
CONSTITUENTS OF KING ICARUS
CONSTITUENTS OF QUEEN ARACHNE

THE FOUR TRINITIES:
TRINITY OF THE BURGUNDY KING, 
TRINITY OF THE YELLOW KING 
TRINITY OF THE YELLOW QUEEN, 
TRINITY OF THE BURGUNDY QUEEN 

THE EXILED CARDINALS:
CARDINAL ROOK,
CARDINAL BISHOP,
CARDINAL KNIGHT, 
CARDINAL PAWN.

THE ONE:
THE BOARD













AS A RESULT,
EACH OF THE TWELVE DISCIPLINES OF A.R.I.A.D.N.E. FORM SIX BINOMIAL PAIRS.
THESE BINOMIAL PAIRS AMALGAMATE INTO THE SIX EXPONENTS OF THE WOMAN IN THE WALLPAPER.
