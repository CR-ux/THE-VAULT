*“Hope” is the thing with feathers -*

*That perches in the soul -*  

*And sings the tune without the words -*  

*And never stops - at all -*  

  

*And sweetest - in the Gale - is heard -*  

*And sore must be the storm -*  

*That could abash the little Bird*  

*That kept so many warm -*  

  

*I’ve heard it in the chillest land -*  

*And on the strangest Sea -*  

*Yet - never - in Extremity,*  

*It asked a crumb - of me.""*

- Emily Dickinson



*"...With the drawing of this Love and the voice of this Calling*

*We shall not cease from exploration*  
*And the end of all our exploring*  
*Will be to arrive where we started*  
*And know the place for the first time.*  
*Through the unknown, unremembered gate*  
*When the last of earth left to discover*  
*Is that which was the beginning;*  
*At the source of the longest river*  
*The voice of the hidden waterfall*  
*And the children in the apple-tree*

*Not known, because not looked for*  
*But heard, half-heard, in the stillness*  
*Between two waves of the sea.*  
*Quick now, here, now, always--*  
*A condition of complete simplicity*  
*(Costing not less than everything)*  
*And all shall be well and*  
*All manner of thing shall be well*  
*When the tongues of flames are in-folded*  
*Into the crowned knot of fire*  
*And the fire and the rose are one."*

- T.S. Eliot




I write 

And think 

I have to get that

Down

Quickly 

Slow Rising out of sleep 

as this 

pour out of me 

  

Air 

In the cold, biting 

Through gaps where teeth used to be

These words aren’t mine, 

The language I speak is a trifurcation of knotted tongues, millennial, perennial, a plait of flesh rapt round a chess piece, no peace, no justice, remembrance of them, forgotten to the centuries

  

Certain death 

(Textile, stitch, in time, we all die, a red dress, a black dress, a red robe shrouding a black dress - black dresses - a red robe over a black dress over a red wound through a scar over a blackness of a star, oh my god the stitching, the stitch that ripped you from my pocket - of time, black dresses, living ancestors - Arca’s words, the slit, a light switch, places O’er witch, we won’t go, A, Di, an Other, chance, Adrian, String loosened and the chime now severed, coming back partitioned, sectioned into my looming headquarters, four times the dosage I’d gone down with, a loom, a womb, blood red drained, umbilical tie, a dye, a dying, We All Will) 

Like a subtle going 

A silent unannounced grievance 

A Secret leaving from the party 

I missed you for the war 

Mars 

Red planet, 

Ringing, 

Calling, 

Searching for some

Thing 

A rock 

A cracked red place surrounded by the 

Black of space 

Know

Water

  

  

  

A squeaking sound of something like a bubble of air releasing from my left ear 

Altering me

Alerting me to sit down at the altar 

Of becoming 

Fire 

The Will 

The spark that dances in the 

  

dream was of a hotel which was also a prison. 

I was a guard now, not an inmate - go figure 

Skating flies 

  

Just as I write this the letting agent lets me know via email there is a waste pipe leak at the property and that they’re aware I’m not there but can somebody grant access to the plumber 

Waste Pipe burst, and blackness that looks like coffee grounds I offered to the ancestors has seeped into the porous sandstone 

Earth in water 

Water into earth 

Daughter of the fire inspired to madness into second birth 

  

Or for the seven billionth 

  

In the fourth forth river fire-consigned month 

  

Pouring out the blockage 

Of the endless moments making mornings of endless mourning 

Trying to give something back from the little I had to give 

  

As a song called “spill” comes on 

Shuffle 

cards 

Cardinal 

(My phone just typed 1/0 in accidental earnest) 

I’ve come to realise these muscle spasm moments from medicated dyskinesia or celestial synaesthesia are a message reaching through the wreckage from the ages from the forwards from the ancestors to tell me little things so gargantuan in weight in little wings of icons to gods in little sporadic and supposedly erroneous tapping of emojis 

🛢️Barrel 

As in, lumen, pipe, containment 

As in bound by blood 

Or pain of body 

Salt 

Assault and 

Battery 🔋 

  

  

I reply and say I’m 

Here

I came back on bonfire night 

  

And say I’ve almost gathered enough pledges, just £70 short of full rent payment 

And I’d be happy to grant the plumber access and how will this work? 

  

  

I finish shitting and  come to the kitchen 

Drinking a now-effervesced painkiller the doctor sent me back with to help my back with 

I am also, simultaneously pouring a refill of coffee into my Moon mug 

  

[just then - Paul, the agents’ plumnber, called me - I say “ah, your name means bearer of good news!” He laughs and says well it also means “small” so I’ll bring you some small good news, 

We laugh together as he says a 

Scaffold 

- Your art project, never finished, I collected pictures of scaffolding I thought you might find beautiful and put them in a google drive of my own but never told you 

Will be needed 

His surname:

Ward]

  

Yesterday was almost more dreamlike than the story I just apparently woke from 

I walked through a path I’d never seen before I needed the darkness of containment of the absence of light to show me the way 

I walked through a gap in the trees and thought of Fae mythology I held out my right hand as my left tried to record with a camera in case through device like a celestial telegram telling me to 

Stop 

Start

  

My life and my art are becoming One

Or 

They always were 

This work is spilling out into reel life like the pipe that has burst with the furling of the Sun

  

Anyway coming back from this fine-and-welcome interruption to my dancing round my alter (which, by the way is a wooden double-levelled table shaped in a Hexagon - Six Times Two, The Twelve scaffolded in supporting opposition)

  

I am drinking coffee now but then, when I was at the time of writing a few lines back I was pouring coffee while drinking a derivative of opium - codeine and paracetamol - derived from poppies, and the laboratory

Pouring into my future-emptied cup as I drank from one

At the time I had not given thought to The Star’s tarot symbol 

And to my left the drum~ the drum! The washing machine drum, 

Still closed 

I’d not taken the clothes out in time, like I’d planned to have done

I grin like a madwoman 

So at peace with my plans of bettering crumbling 

But, centring my resolve to bring my body and my soul into some semblance of greater balance (as I’m cradled by my looping thoughts of Goethe and of Newton, imagining a scene where they’re waltzing in a ballroom alone) 

And I try to open the not-quite full binbag of trash collected just before leaving for the hospital in London

And accidentally (yeah, right, I know better know, or worse somehow, I just can’t stop keep writing all this poetry for the half-heard and not looked for generation that’s to come) 

I rip the opening too wide, splitting 

And I aloud say “oops” and laugh, unwitting 

Covering it in the swaddle plastic cloth of a branded black and new one 

Witch

By light of whitest magick 

*as is everything, all the wrongs and Rites that I have ever and by the time this all is writ I will have done 

It’s my last one 

  

_I need to tidy my flat some,_ 

_In case the bearer of good news requires entry to assess this burst pipe situation_

- Pin up artwork done in London - you’re allowed pins now!
- Vacuum 
- Take out the laundry and put in the final load from the suitcase 
- Take the trash of memories down to that same place he’d shouted from and be done be done be done

  

My life has been a symphony of energy tight-laddered-broken rung potentials justly aching, begging all the time to be sung, be sung, be sung 

  

And then the undulation of a single finch alters me to another (maybe just the same) grey gull 

Now facing away, with a magpie on the eright 

Probably the same little guy that welcomed me in the ending of last night 

To land, once more atop the angel poised and ready to take flight in reaching, reaching, reaching

I go to do my superstitious salute and realise both the gull and magpie they are gone 

  

_The shroud, the pipe, the organ - they need holes, they need cracks to let the laying eggs of waste out, or at least someone in_ 

_The trumpets of drosophila herald change that is a steady shore of lore that’s sure to come_ 

  

As Phil sings about symbols recurring throughout his life and building his own mythology, and I think of him, and them, and me, and Jung 

He sings into both of my ears, caressing them:

_Myths come true_ 

  

  

- I get a phone call, the line is unheard, unhearable 
- But in the distance in the cold and lower altitude outside I can hear the semblance of the voice I’d heard before and I crane my painful neck down from the window, he can hear me but not me hymn, it seems 
- I laugh as he performs some form of sign language telling me to turn the faucet on 
- I obey, and open my window just a crack to cold air, and behind a cloud, the Sun 
- Pausing Phil I hear the good news (small, for me, but not for someone) 
- He can see he’s been given the wrong location 
- It is in truth my neighbour who has the plumbing problem 
- I shout through the crack to the creek of that verbose and loose artery running down from the window 

  

Arnas texts to say she can’t quite make the visit to the Forest today but would I like to see a waterfall near her house instead and I sent her this draft but without this line because I wrot ethics after Ward had told me the small good news 

  

In the dream one of the psychiatrists from the hospital was dressed as a champagne bottle (since Halloween but still was) 

Someone tried to ask her quite nicely about it and she started to cry as if this ridiculous costume was in dedication to someone lost 

  

  

In the waking world I drink a shot of ginger 

Like the ones you and Sylvia had made for yourselves 

And chase it with the juice of an apple now regarding the wind chime which I fixed and placed in a new, ,backward facing position, 

The white side pointing inward, black side outward, seems to say “look out into the light”

So I do, and see that much-before seen sight 

The blackened, singed and burned automotive repair shop which once had housed the greatest and most roaring fire my eyes had ever gazed upon

In fear and such ancient reverence 

The Ashen shroud covered the word DEB’S which was the name of one of the cafeteria workers who remembered my name and always injected a smile onto my face in moonful sunshine mirror of reflection 

  

Out of the washing machine drum I pull my pair of bought for myself burgundy pyjamas as if knowing I was headed for a restful destination 

And out comes an auxiliary cable, umbilical, resembling (and I think it’s the same at first) one of those red elastic strings I’d come across in the woods in the clearing next to the 10mph sign which was the distant view of writing most of this story although by the time it’s done I know it will represent just an infinitesimal fraction of this magnum of my odyssey of insanity and ancestral reclamation  

And then I pull out the red robe entangled with countless pairs of fishnets and black tights and Jesus Christ this is all too much poetry for me to try to contain I really must get these menial tasks done and come down to life that must just be dust particles floating in a long lost son

  

I put in the second load, the last 

From the soil of load I’d carried back 

And then I see Tofu, Isla 

Oh Islands of my Becoming 

  

I’d done you so wrong in our connection 

A google drive collaborative journal I can’t bring myself to open 

I’d become my Welsh-inherited ex-partners reflection and that was a daffodil I could not bear to be hunted by or look upon

Any longer  of a life together and I’d have died 

  

I start the whirring of the drum 

On setting ‘2’ now and remember how you’d said it’s okay we can wait I can wait to wash them 

Your treasured childhood possession 

I wrapped them in a pillowcase, not to hide them but to protect them, Like I had with Colin already 

I think about your allergies and all the smoke that I’d thoughtlessly blown about the room that Tofu placed gently on a shelf I couldn’t handle their presence in my bed any longer and in my reckless wrecked and wretched wrung with no-wrung-or-wing out of that place I 

Thought that your wanting space was the same as the one I shouldn’t have ever named 

I thought you needed physical space from me in bed for the repulsion at my skin but it was your own skin’s repulsion at the chemicals I contained within or hadn’t washed off in my 

_Mania_

_You used to call me Maniac_ 

_With such love_ 

_As I pulled out glass from my feet from that night’s performance where I’d accidentally or perhaps on purpose stepped on a lightbulb and smashed it into my skin while screaming half-contained within a cage that had an accordion bound to the bars which I pushed against gravity and pulled down with it and pulled myself down with it I was naked save for a set of symbols laid upon my deranged and scarred body and containing all the shame of my genitalia within inguinal canals of rivers of rivers of rivers about to be released from me_ 

  

Containment - expansion - expression - retention - vertical stake holding place of horizon - god - do these cycles ever end?

_A stone woman gives birth to a child at night_

  

  

When I’d dream 

There was a dog 

A few dogs 

One of whom knew how to turn the lights on and off 

Chinaski - the name of a writers alter ego 

  

  

Sin, Sine 

Have I written about the bat I saw above the pond of bodies yet? 

I really must not forget to include that most divine encounter 

I whispered to him 

And then catching myself I just spoke at my normal all-surrounding resonance of din 

_I just want to say something true_ 

I said something true to the bat 

As he flapped, blind, but seeing More with his unheard hald-herd clicks than the sight of my own human eyes could have ever knew 

Cones for red, for green, and those for blue 

But he just had the click of his tongue and made do 

No, surpassed my paths of forking 

Tongues 

We spoke to one another in tongues 

After I’d passed through 

That gap of Janus in the blackened hues of maybe oak or Yews 

  

  

I fall asleep again and think I’ve written way more down than I have, semi-waking to my mouth rambling to my brain

  

Notification: your payment plan for Scottish Goat Company is resuming 

I need to move the money sent to me by that shimmered living ancestor I met on a plane back from

Belgium 

Or was it London 

Or was it on the way to Belgium 

There was such a long delay 

For a reason 

So I could talk to her 

I cried so much 

Where was I going 

Or was it somewhere I was coming back from 

Murmuration of a soon to be or had been always single 

Starling 

The name of the bank 

You’d told me to sign up to 

You tried to get me to be organised 

And then ended up despising me somehow for it 

Starling 

The star 

Lingua 

Ignota 

Publisher 

Maybe I should email them 

This text feels sacred and experimental enough to at least send them
