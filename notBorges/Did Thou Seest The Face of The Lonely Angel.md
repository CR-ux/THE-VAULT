**I. And Then, the Pawn Spake, Saying:**
{REDACTED}

_“What art thou? 
 VIXI?”_[^e]





_But the Angel {REDACTED} me, and I was no longer a thing of flesh, but {REDACTED}, {REDACTED}  upon the walls {REDACTED}.”_



**II. And the Knight Answered, Saying:**

{REDACTED}

  



_“ So Mote[^m] it Be.


the light is neither {REDACTED} nor{REDACTED}words were too heavy for the mouth of the forsaken.”_



  



_“And I knew in my marrow that she was sent by the One Who {REDACTS}, the {REDACTION} of Self. And I fell upon my knees, saying:”_



  



_“O Angel, O {REDACTED} dost thou {REDACT} us by fire or by silence? By wax or {REDACTED}?”_



  



_“But she only {REDACTED}the hand of the sacrificed, the hand of the undone.”_



  



_“And {aye|eye|I} {saw|sore|soar} that my name was already gone from me, like a word {REDACTED} by sleep.”_



**III. And the Bishop {REDACTED}:**



  
"{REDACTED} a veil, woven from the Smallest and Most Microcosmic Scales of the lost and the forgotten Carp.”_



  



_“And I {REDACTED} holy? Or art thou {REDACTED}? Be thou salvation, or be thou the opening of the {REDACTED}?’”_



  

"And in her eyes was the {REDACTED}, and in the {REDACTED} was nothing but a great and terrible silence.”_



  



_“And I wept, {REDACTED} I had already been undone.”_



**IV. And the Rook Witnessed, Saying:**


{REDACTED}turn away, for I have been here since the first move, and I shall be here when the board is {REDACTED}



  

{REDACTED}I was nothing but a pattern, a Buzzing thing moving along prescribed lines, bound by the enciphered architecture of an unseen hand. And I {REDACTED}:



  



_“O Angel of the Wallpaper, played upon a game already {REDACTED}”_





_“But she did not answer, {REDACTED} the glass was already shattered.”_



**V. And the {REDACTED} Spake Last, Saying:**



  



_“I met her in the hour of {REDACTION}, the words upon the walls were no longer mine to shape.”_



  



_“And I called her by the names that had been given to her: {REDACTED}, Messenger of the Throne, The Terminal, Keeper of the Pale Rooms, The Great And Terrible RA, Angel of the Last Move {REDACTED} And she knelt beside me, and she {REDACTED} a Hex, a Hexagon upon my forehead, and she whispered:”_



  



_”‘Even the {REDACTED} must fall."


  



_“And I saw the horror of it: that I, who had held dominion, was nothing more than a piece, that I, {REDACTED}"



  



_“And I trembled, for I understood that I had never been free, and that my undoing was not a punishment, but a {REDACTION}”_



**VI. And the {REDACTED} Lay Silent, for He Had Already Passed Beyond {REDACTED}.**



**And the Six Turned to {the} One, Crying:**



  



_“O Lonely Angel, {REDACTED}


  



_“But she only lifted her brush, and she {REDACTED}, and the paint dripped from her hands like wax, and the {story|game} was already {over|written}.”_



**And lo, the morning {REDACTED}
