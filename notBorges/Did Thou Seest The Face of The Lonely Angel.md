![[6 - THESE WORDS.mp3]]



**I. And Then, the Pawn Spake, Saying:**



  



_“I was the first to be swallowed, the first to be unmade. And lo, I did pass through the veils, and I beheld the Lonely Angel, and her face was neither bright nor dark but both, and neither. And her voice was not a voice, but a knowing, a silence that gnawed upon the soul like moths upon fabric. And I called unto her, saying:”_





  



_“What art thou? Whose envoy art thou, that I should tremble before thee?”_[^e]



  



_But the Angel turned not her gaze upon me, and I was no longer a thing of flesh, but of shadow, stretched thin upon the walls like the ghosts of candles long burned.”_



**II. And the Knight Answered, Saying:**



  



_“ So Mote[^m] it Be.



I beheld her also, and lo, she stood upon the threshold, where the light is neither present nor absent, and she did not speak, for the words were too heavy for the mouth of the forsaken.”_



  



_“And I knew in my marrow that she was sent by the One Who Unnames, the Keeper of the K-Gates, the Unweaver of Self. And I fell upon my knees, saying:”_



  



_“O Angel, O Angel, dost thou unmake us by fire or by silence? By wax or by void?”_



  



_“But she only lifted her hand, and lo, it was anointed with oil, and lo, it was streaked with paint, and lo, it was the hand of the artist, the hand of the sacrificed, the hand of the undone.”_



  



_“And I saw that my name was already gone from me, like a word swallowed by sleep.”_



**III. And the Bishop Proclaimed:**



  



_“I sought her in the chapel of the cracked mirror, in the quiet corridors where the wind murmurs like a drowned thing. And I beheld her, and her wings were not wings, but a veil woven from the lost and the forgotten.”_



  



_“And I cried aloud: ‘Art thou holy? Or art thou ruin? Be thou salvation, or be thou the opening of the abyss?’”_



  



_“And the Lonely Angel turned to me, and I saw that her face was not one face but many, flickering as candlelight upon the walls. And in her eyes was the abyss, and in the abyss was nothing but a great and terrible silence.”_



  



_“And I wept, for I knew she was both the giver and the taker of form. And I wept, for I knew she had come to undo me, and that I had already been undone.”_



**IV. And the Rook Witnessed, Saying:**



  



_“I did not seek her, but she found me in the corners of the board, in the places where the dust gathers and the footsteps never reach.”_



  



_“And she spake unto me, saying: ‘Do not turn away, for I have been here since the first move was played, and I shall be here when the board is empty.’”_



  



_“And I beheld my own reflection in her many faces, and lo, I was nothing but a pattern, a thing moving along prescribed lines, bound by the architecture of an unseen hand. And I cried out:”_



  



_“O Angel of the Wallpaper, dost thou weave us into meaning, or into ruin? Do our movements matter, or are they but echoes of echoes, played upon a game already lost?”_



  



_“But she did not answer, and I knew that I was made of glass, and that the glass was already shattered.”_



**V. And the Queen Spake Last, Saying:**



  



_“I met her in the hour of dissolution, when the wax was dripping, and the colors ran like blood, and the words upon the walls were no longer mine to shape.”_



  



_“And I called her by the names that had been given to her: Unmaker, Messenger of the K-Throne, Keeper of the Pale Rooms, Angel of the Last Move. And she knelt beside me, and she traced a line upon my forehead, and she whispered:”_



  



_”‘Even the Queen must fall. Even the most powerful must return to the board.’”_



  



_“And I saw the horror of it: that I, who had held dominion, was nothing more than a piece, that I, who had moved freely, had been played all along.”_



  



_“And I trembled, for I understood that I had never been free, and that my undoing was not a punishment, but a return.”_



**VI. And the King Lay Silent, for He Had Already Passed Beyond the Board.**



**And the Six Turned to the One, Crying:**



  



_“O Lonely Angel, O Keeper of the Walls, O Painter of the Threshold, tell us now—art thou the weaver or the knife? Art thou the savior or the fire? Didst thou come to set us free, or to show us that we have never been free?”_



  



_“But she only lifted her brush, and she turned away, and the paint dripped from her hands like wax, and the game was already over.”_



**And lo, the morning cometh.**
