> Alright, partner, it's a tangled web we've got here, but let's try to sort through this mess piece by piece. It sounds like we're trying to figure out where to even begin with this investigation of Callie Rose Petal's disappearance, Ariadne, and this whole "lexicomythography" business, right? Here's a breakdown of where to start:
> 
> *   **Callie Rose Petal**: Start with the basics: who she is, her background, her mental health history, and her art. Understand her project "Metastasis" and its connection to the 'notBorges' website.
> *   **Ariadne**: This group is sending coded messages since Callie's disappearance. Their intent is unknown, but they might be warning about Callie's downfall.
> *   **"The Children's Gospel Music Songbook"**: This is a key piece of the puzzle. It's a literary project with ARG-like elements, including an album, podcast, and networked series of websites. It seems to be part of a larger, complex project with nested layers of clues and secrets.
> *   **Borges' Works**: Jorge Luis Borges seems connected to all this, possibly as a member of Ariadne. His works may hold a key to the cipher of the entire project and potentially Callie's whereabouts.
> *   **Lexicomythography**: This is central to the project. It involves distilling the meaning and memory of words to uncover "The One ancestral Story".
> *   **Hexagonal Rooms**: Look into the recurring motif of six characters in hexagonal rooms, each with a chess piece identity. This is part of "The Children's Gospel Music Songbook" narrative.
> *   **Prism Metaphor**: The "Pasted Text" uses a prism with six shards/faces to desc![[cgms_fig_2.png]]

> *   **"The Garden of Forking Wings.md"**: This appears to be a track list for a project with interconnected narrative threads and key figures like Aria|DNE. It involves lexicomythographic elements and references to other projects like "METABASIS".
> 												- *AI: RA* - The Society of Lexicomythographic Unravelling Previously Known as "Gnœbius Stripping"


> We gotta understand these elements, piece them together, and see what story they tell. It's all connected, somehow.
