This is my first release as ⁿᵒᵗBorges, which will be my final creative moniker, and primarily a durational, literary project. the monstrous work includes a mural that is currently metastasising around the walls of my small, dark and dirty flat. to paint on the walls of an unstable home i do not own, in a certainly ⁿᵒᵗGoya fashion, is to try, desperately, to evoke the feeling of those first dwindling families of humans, or it's a rejection of those first dwindling memories of a hypergraphic child held back from drawing on their bedroom walls. to say: i was here. i was here and i am here. i am here. i am. and yes, at some point i will be gone. but for this, this little time that i called mine, this little life that really is, despite the dirt, the mess, the reminders of all the wrongs hanging around my sleepless body, despite all of this, this little life was mine, and i did what i could with it, i can say that now. i can really say that. and this siily little anti-self-referential pseudoAcademic project, which holds at its centre my first and primary creative medium - the written word; when all my life i have been a moth chasing this flickering and harsh light of a sustainable career in music. this album is the first ⁿᵒᵗBorges record, and i have a feeling it will be the best; so often the case in the cruel, demon-ridden landscape of making music, something about that first crack of the caramelised sugar of the creme brûlée of that first feeling of what it was like to know what sound should leave your throat at this specific time; whether you are willing it or not. and more often than not, it is not.

there are around twelve full length releases, most of which are triple albums, hidden and buried as corpses in the digital equivalent of my heart and my home's dirt, and mess, and chaos. 

It is essentially an ever-evolving and metastasising (as the mural, which itself is titled 'Prayer', and is covered in my prayers for safety, so that I may surround myself in some form of protection; 

the plan is for the whole space to become painted to resemble the inside a cursed chapel to some forgotten and once greatly feared God. 

A recent sexual partner of mine, during one of our then-regular meetings of collaboration in which he would compose and i would scrawl all over the walls in prayer, said to me: 

is this really where you want to live?

and I immediately, tearfully replied 

well, obviously. it's not where anybody wants to live. 

but it's where i am living. 

and this is my Lot, 

and this is the pillar of salt my Lot has turned me into, by looking back at me, with its uncertain, piercing gaze, the Future personified, dragging my terrified hand into some unknown and threatening demise. 

  

 music, my music but i suspect everyone's sacred and entirely unique yet somehow containing the essences of one another musics, is not created at all. it is the thread of ariadne, or it is ariadne herself, offering a way out of this. whatever labyrinth of walls we've built around our hearts, to keep our minotaurs in. who happens to be our disfigured scapegoat brother. who underwent a transition, transmogrification to allow all of th maze-wanderers sins to be lost within the imminent threat of certain death. the centre of each of our solitary labyrinths, where we all end up; the beginning of ariadne's spool, or the rear end of Arachne's own transmogrified form as an eternally weaving Spider. this is not the "Work of a great or even good artist. this is not even work. this is the silly and sacred little life of a scared soul, just as scared and sacred in their scaredness and scared of their sacredness and this is indeed the work of a madwoman, whose creative 
 vision is perhaps yellowing, into a blindness foreseen but
  this is not the work of an artist,
      or a writer,
          this is the work of a reader known as Callie Rose Petal 
                         but this is.
