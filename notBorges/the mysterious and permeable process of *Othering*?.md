[^yule]:i think | as much as I am falling | {, all one | {a{p/{p}ar/{i}}t||<sub>+</sub> <sup>-</sup>{{i|o}n}}} alone, its my way of finally forgiving[^myself] the characters i've made of every one who've just been writing what ever love letters they can with the sentences they've been served with.[^y2]

[^way]:by the way / a toy piano shoved in there too and sang by three of the same girl panned in a dynamic plait; singing the song to, from and about another girl, who she's much too much the same as to be able to love her in the way she thought she was meant to[^NB]
[^NB]:much like that story that Borges once told; where he meets his younger self on a bench on a cliff overlooking an Ocean that was all fading into a homogenous Yellow in his dwindling vision but ever-blossoming Vision: he said something like "Alas, we could never get along. We were too alike; the image of our Selves in reflection, abominable, and one of us, was destined, doomed, to become the Other.[^mb] 
[^mb]:but actually maybe the doing things in a shitty garbled messy way and understanding our hurt selves by the mirrored way we've hurt others might actually be the only, reæl way we can actually stop hurting, even for a little moment of {p{ $: s}e{udo} -lesbianis{h<sup>1/2</sup>m<sub>2/1</sub>}, t{w}o|get|her?

[^myself]:lexDef {lacronym|| *Prodverb*} { "forgiving" is a lacronym which stands for "for Giving {in|out}"|/* 'Giving in'* usually means to stop doing something by the internal depletion of Will. *\'*Giving out' usually refers to a device halting its function from external sources or absence of such, as in the running out of fuel necessary to maintain motion. || *prodverb context:* **"forgiving the characters"** - to acknowledge, wholeheartedly, the very futility of language, to encapsulate the entirety or the paradox: the meaning of any memory. be that of a person once close to you in Salt but now not so much, yet always and all ways so within in Sulphur, in Mercury, and so very dear to you, or the memory of the three second dream of a single fly.
