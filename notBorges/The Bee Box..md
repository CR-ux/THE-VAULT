The box is{REDACTED} it is dangerous.  
I have to live with it overnight  
And I can’t keep away from it.  
There are no windows, so I can’t see what is in there.  
There is only a little grid, no exit.
{REDACTED}
It is dark, dark,  
With the swarmy feeling of {REDACTED} hands  
Minute and shrunk for export,  
{REDACTED} on {REDACTED}, angrily clambering.

How can I let them out?  
It is the noise that appalls me most of all,  
The unintelligible syllables.  
{REDACTED}
Small, taken one by one, but my god, together!
{REDACTED}
I am {k}not {REDACTED}.  
I have simply ordered a box of {REDACTED}s.  
They can be {REDACTED}.  
They can REDACT, I need {REDACTED} them {REDACTED}, I REDACT the owner.
I wonder how hungry they are.  
I wonder if they would REDACT me  
If I just {REDACTED} the locks and stood back and turned into a tree.  {REDACTED}
They might ignore me immediately  
{REDACTED} veil.  
I am no source of honey  
So why should they turn on me?  
Tomorrow I will be {REDACTED}, I will set them free.

The box is only temporary."[^s]
