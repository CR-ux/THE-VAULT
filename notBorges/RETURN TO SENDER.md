THE ANSWER IS A TOROIDAL SYSTEM OF INFINITELY CONTIGUOUS HEXAGONS WHICH SOME CALL THE HOSPITAL.

THE WOMAN IN THE WALLPAPER, OR, PERHAPS, GOD, IS OBSERVING THE SIX HEXAGONAL ROOMS WHICH BORDER HERS. 

HER ROOM'S WALLS ARE ONE-WAY MIRRORS.

THESE WALLS ARE TRANSPARENT ONLY WHEN LOOKED OUT OF, FROM WITHIN. 

UPON THESE WINDOW-WALLS, THE WOMAN RECORDS HER FINDINGS OF THE SIX BELIEVERS, WHO THEMSELVES PASS A SINGLE SCROLL OF WALLPAPER AROUND THEIR ONE-WAY SYSTEM OF VENTS.

THESE SIX DO NOT HAVE MEMORY OF THEIR NAMES, OR THEIR LIVES OUTSIDE OF THE HOSPITAL.
THIS IS BECAUSE THEY ARE THE FIRST SIX LIVES TO EVER EXIST. 

FROM THESE SIX LIVES, CONTAINED HELPLESSLY IN THESE SIX ROOMS, DESIGNATED THEIR OWN RESPECTIVE SYMBOLS (CHESS PIECES), COME TWELVE MORE ROOMS, OF EXPONENTIALLY GREATER PERSPECTIVE.[^P]

These twelve rooms are Twelve works of music by the artist unknown as notBorges 

Each of these twelve rooms are found in metaphysical space, 
in the twelve gated chambers of the heart of you, 
dear listener of these words, or reader of this text. 

From these twelve chambers 
come Eighteen more 'Rooms'
These rooms are Universes 
of Stories, of Characters, of Letters telling Stories sent between Characters 

And eventually, as everything must, 
With each revelation of each of these lives 
contained within Hexagons 
with walls which, at this perspective[^P] 
are far too wide to ever be found

But information, 
Ideas - 
They have a way 
of getting 

Around

And once the loop 
of Love, 
of the Love of an Idea 
an Idea carried from one artist, one thinker, 
to many, to a chain of many 
to the binding, restrictive and liberating chain of 
Communication of an Idea 
of an Idea of Love 
of the Love of Ideas 
of the Communication of the Love for the Idea 
of the People 
We are contained here with 
Just 
On the other side 
of 


a                                   ||                            wall

the Hospital will collapse to a single Hexagon again, 
So all of this 
can be returned 
to sender
