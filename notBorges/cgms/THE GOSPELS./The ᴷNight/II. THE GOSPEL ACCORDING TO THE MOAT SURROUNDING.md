**OR -I DREAMED OF PHAROAH AND A WOMAN WHO DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS A PHAROAH DREAMING**

by the Knight

in the
night I dreamed of Pharoah and a woman who didn't know she was a Pharoah dreaming herself into being. She'd made or was making a documentary about Egyptian theology and burial rites. {REDACTED}The Kingdom {REDACTED}to ruin {REDACTED}underground. {REDACTED}One Source{REDACTED} Ultimate Truth of self-generating animacy {REDACTED}unification through this Monolith[^Mo] {REDACTED}wheels within wheels of Hierarchies {REDACTED}society. {REDACTED} in[^Gi] the history of time. "
  

In the dream 
I, {REDACTED} talk, {REDACTED} into her 
{REDACTED} trying to escape this place {REDACTED} rowing a hollow wooden {REDACTED} was also on the boat with her. {REDACTED} tragically necessary farce for long enough. As I told her we were inside of a dream and that I'd woken from a deeper dream inside this one that Told me she was the dreamer of this one, she was incredibly {afraid|excited}[^B] at the unveiling of this internal and heretofore unconsciously known, alternative escape route {REDACTED}

  
I was talking to a woman who was gossamer of god ████████████ a Moat. ████
I joined her on her vehicle, at times of wood at times of plastic but always brought straight back to her round████████████████ surrounded████████████a Moat.
████ for pasts she'd passed and saw as kept surrounded by a Moat.
Still she kept re{-}turning {from|to} trying to escape across a river which was still, but always changing, and surrounded her, a Moat.


she'd made this████proof ████ as proofing ████████ truth████ loam-hued letters████ i was no longer found within her████████████████by a Moat. 
I'd ████ had a dream in which she was a Goddess and she was still dreaming ████ a Word surrounded by a River ████we are planted still but carried ████ sticks dropped████ Children████bridges████that which trickles under all our stillness████put through and return to which i {hope|suppose} is also known as dust which must just flow as closed and oval as a Moat.

Which ████ make something from this Mess ████the Earth████ hear me████that he put himself inside me there as ████ a Thing to use ████as thirst ████████of fruit ████does run like rivers that are sourced and born████of the Every Thing he's done

which is surrounded by a Moat.

████idols found beneath the ground of bodies now surrounded by a Moat.
████Body scattered in dead leaves████call of waving endlessly towards the going is surrounded by a Moat.
{REDACTED}████
████████████I unveil a thickness of fog about the rooftops the likes of which I have never laid light upon ████ together, blanketed in ████opacity,████████████████everything I could ever hope to know - A single crow, ████black, ████(he could have, indeed, been lacking One ████half of his visual organs) peering ████ into mine (One of which I could have, in deed, been missing[^B])
His████tones of a Folk song[^W] ████ in the fledging winter cold, ████ I, ███████ Words, my████ thread of this ████████ winter jumper, finding no████record████ heard before[^B]████ the████Bard.[^Boat] 

SMIB[^Hope]


Time passes.

And then -


Upon discussing the fundamental Truth of the Paradox of Imminence Vs. Transcendence through the lens of the Pantheon vs. the Pleroma or Oneness with my{REDACTED}self, Selene reveals herself in the midst, directly ahead of me, from the still-open eye of my unblinded window. 

I realise that Selene is transfeminine and Endymion is her assigned perceived identity at birth, forever coming back to this pain, itself wishing for eternal sleep, oar

[^Mo]: The word monolith comes from the Greek word monólithos, which means "made of one stone". Monoliths can be made of hard rock, and some are volcanic plugs. Large and powerful entity; A monolith can also refer to something large and powerful that functions as a unified whole, such as a secret organisation or demonic entity in the form of a serpent-pigeon, that which people worship as a Deity. Solid-surface basin; A monolith is a solid-surface basin made from a solid-surface material and supported by a modular steel bracket system. The monolith system is customisable and can be used in washrooms. 
[^Gi]: 'Giving in' usually means to stop doing something by the internal depletion of Will.[^will] 'Giving out' usually refers to a device halting its function from external sources or absence of such, as in the running out of fuel necessary to maintain motion.
[^B]: Or, perhaps definitely, both.
[^R]: this pain was either an intensely worrying question of my physical/general holistic health, or an answer of isolation, forcing me to remain shielded within solitude by limiting my mobility[^B]
[^Hope]: So Mote It Be[^W]. Or, Thank you my darling God[^B]. I know I must return to my relatively menial but, for now, much more financially lucrative employment as a software engineer in the majority of my waking hours, at some point soon, perhaps once my latest period of sick leave ends in around three weeks. I sincerely resolve to maintain these acts of recording this supposedly insignificant but deeply divine experience of living my life in solitude through The Word; no longer journalling my life, but my Life journalling I. I sincerely hope (perhaps, knowing) that I will persist in my unending rituals, finding poetry, always there, which was always there, in every single moment. I pray, I pray, dear God I pray, that I have the strength to revolve about this resolve enough for this to be enough
[^W]: "Will It Be"[^Will] , a song my Michael Yonkers.
[^Will]: Which is a question, Or, an answer to said question.[^B] which is to say it is a question which answers itself, round again like fencing waters of a most uncrossable Moat 
[^Boat]: Navigate your boat / Keeping it afloat / Round and round / And round and round / And round and round the Moat
