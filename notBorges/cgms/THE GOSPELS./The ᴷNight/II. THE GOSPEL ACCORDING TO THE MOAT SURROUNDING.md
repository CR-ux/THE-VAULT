**OR -I DREAMED OF PHAROAH AND A WOMAN WHO DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS A PHAROAH DREAMING**

by the Knight

in the
night I dreamed of Pharoah and a woman who didn't know she was a Pharoah dreaming herself into being. She'd made or was making a documentary about Egyptian theology and burial rites. {REDACTED}The Kingdom {REDACTED}to ruin {REDACTED}underground. {REDACTED}One Source{REDACTED} Ultimate Truth of self-generating animacy {REDACTED}unification through this Monolith[^Mo] {REDACTED}wheels within wheels of Hierarchies {REDACTED}society. {REDACTED} in[^Gi] the history of time. "
  

In the dream 
I, {REDACTED} talk, {REDACTED} into her 
{REDACTED} trying to escape this place {REDACTED} rowing a hollow wooden {REDACTED} was also on the boat with her. {REDACTED} tragically necessary farce for long enough. As I told her we were inside of a dream and that I'd woken from a deeper dream inside this one that Told me she was the dreamer of this one, she was incredibly {afraid|excited}[^B] at the unveiling of this internal and heretofore unconsciously known, alternative escape route {REDACTED}

  
I was talking to a woman who was gossamer of god who did not know that she was gossiping about herself trying to escape this world which was surrounded by a Moat. 

I joined her on her vehicle, at times of wood at times of plastic but always brought straight back to her round shop she kept surrounded by a Moat.

In the dream there was a documentary written by the girl, now dead, immortalised through work she made about this Pharaoh she had held in arms of awe or detachment academic for pasts she'd passed and saw as kept surrounded by a Moat.

Still she kept re{-}turning {from|to} trying to escape across a river which was still, but always changing, and surrounded her, a Moat.


she'd made this film as proof or perhaps proofing of the truth which i don't know if she had realised yet but forsooth i spoke to her inside her shop of cardboard loam-hued letters, golden locks and bone-made reams of decorative paper made for shrouding all the large typefaces three dimensional and not hollow, rather filled with emptiness once i felt comfortable enough to make my presence known and i was no longer found within her thoughts surrounded by a Moat. 

I told her after building up the courage that I'd had a dream in which she was a Goddess and she was still dreaming up the world which was a Word surrounded by a River to the underworld or where in dreaming we are planted still but carried as small sticks dropped by our Children from stone bridges going over that which trickles under all our stillness we are put through and return to which i {hope|suppose} is also known as dust which must just flow as closed and oval as a Moat.

Which is reversal for our trying to make something from this Mess which is sseM backwards which is S for Serpent added to a stem of -sem or half a seed as seamen added to the Earth with purpose of creating light of artificial nature as in Ne as in please, can a-ny Body hear me as I tell you that he put himself inside me there as if I was a shop in which to browse for things as objects as in any Thing to use means thirst for Holy No-Thing which at core of fruit of course does run like rivers that are sourced and born remorseful of the Every Thing he's done

which is surrounded by a Moat.


All my songs and all the songs of every one through every record, which,
{recorded|unrecorded} form the rhythm of this ouroboros of the bored of black and white from lack of foresight built as citadel of awe in greyscale Dorian a tick of time where paintings age and were all staged for someone else to analyse just on the other side of trying to get through to you through rounded inkling's sinking feeling weapons and conjecture of erected idols found beneath the ground of bodies now surrounded by a Moat.

Sea all of these so poorly handled tones blown through the basket reeds of unread music that i hear whether it's murky or so shatteringly clear my ears and mouth and 'I's owe all their boughs and rowing bows in knowing God is simply me who ever closer never towed but floating oh so nearer to the hearing clears a steering head approaching over this great Body scattered in dead leaves in growth is found in losing weight of waiting for the answered call of waving endlessly towards the going is surrounded by a Moat.
{REDACTED}
Lifting the cruelty of my Temple's roll-blind, like an eyelid of a dreamer retiring their employment to enjoy what is perhaps their final waking day; I unveil a thickness of fog about the rooftops the likes of which I have never laid light upon - contemporary metal and ancient, undatable in carbon clay together, blanketed in an unspeakable opacity, showing me everything I could ever hope to know - A single crow, teetering His way to the central point of the central horizon of slate, black, imperceivable by empirical sense in their completeness (he could have, indeed, been lacking One constituent and complementary half of his visual organs) peering directly into mine (One of which I could have, in deed, been missing One[^B])

Dulcet tones of a Folk song[^W] wash around my ears warmly in the fledging winter cold, via the delivered Will ancestors. Adoring the Work's Sound so intensely, I go to search for the Words, my most beloved thread of this crocheted winter jumper, finding none recorded. Instead, I am shown the familiar lyrics of another, different incantation I had once, or never heard before[^B], by the same Bard.[^Boat]

Time passes.

And then -


Upon discussing the fundamental Truth of the Paradox of Imminence Vs. Transcendence through the lens of the Pantheon vs. the Pleroma or Oneness with my{REDACTED}self, Selene reveals herself in the midst, directly ahead of me, from the still-open eye of my unblinded window. 

I realise that Selene is transfeminine and Endymion is her assigned perceived identity at birth, forever coming back to this pain, itself wishing for eternal sleep, oar

[^Mo]: The word monolith comes from the Greek word monólithos, which means "made of one stone". Usages include: Geological formation; A monolith is a single, large stone or rock formation that is often exposed by erosion. Monoliths can be made of hard, solid igneous or metamorphic rock, and some are volcanic plugs. Large and powerful entity; A monolith can also refer to something large and powerful that functions as a unified whole, such as a political organization or Deity. Solid-surface basin; A monolith is a solid-surface basin made from a solid-surface material and supported by a modular steel bracket system. The monolith system is customizable and can be used in washrooms. 
[^Gi]: 'Giving in' usually means to stop doing something by the internal depletion of Will. 'Giving out' usually refers to a device halting its function from external sources or absence of such, as in the running out of fuel necessary to maintain motion.
[^B]: Or, perhaps definitely, both.
[^R]: this pain was either an intensely worrying question of my physical/general holistic health, or an answer of isolation, forcing me to remain shielded within solitude by limiting my mobility[^B]
[^Hope]: So Mote It Be[^W]. Or, Thank you my darling God[^B]. I know I must return to my relatively menial but, for now, much more financially lucrative employment as a software engineer in the majority of my waking hours, at some point soon, perhaps once my latest period of sick leave ends in around three weeks. I sincerely resolve to maintain these acts of recording this supposedly insignificant but deeply divine experience of living my life in solitude through The Word; no longer journalling my life, but my Life journalling I. I sincerely hope (perhaps, knowing) that I will persist in my unending rituals, finding poetry, always there, which was always there, in every single moment. I pray, I pray, dear God I pray, that I have the strength to revolve about this resolve enough for this to be enough
[^W]: "Will It Be"[^Will] , a song my Michael Yonkers.
[^Will]: Which is a question, Or, an answer to said question.[^B] which is to say it is a question which answers itself, round again like fencing waters of a most uncrossable Moat 
[^Boat]: Navigate your boat / Keeping it afloat / Round and round / And round and round / And round and round the Moat
