permalink: I. THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO MISCARRIAGE

*by The Pawn.* 

I arrived in the garden

And a green pixelated spirit  
Was spread about the place  
And turned into a skinny stickman  
Who was thrashing me about  
Like a lion with a carcass in its jaw  
And I told them I loved them  
And then it shrunk  
Into a child

# Behind the waterfall

Is a blackening tunnel  
And the blackening whitens  
And a pink sepia sky became visible  
And a figure pulls me through  
An anthropomorphic cow headed being  
Reaches into the tunnel  
And pulls me into the underworld  
By my arm  
And we are dancing together

_Episode 23 of the Literary Critique podcast discussing The Woman In The Wallpaper's seminal Work, "Phage 23" {do knot, cite yore} source: an unreleased journal, "Red, Ring, Parallel," referenced in an art installation. **The journal entry** itself focuses on the book's content, and its controversial withdrawal. This Podcast was the first time the Work has been discussed publicly, and (following the outcry resulting from its release) was subsequently (within three seconds {of a {single drosophila('s)} dream}) removed from streaming platforms_

"Author X, in their book 'Phage 23' explored a deeply intricate and complicated exploration of an alternate universe in which a virus pandemic consumed the world's population with an alarming death toll, leaving one member of the population with a superhuman ability of hearing, but the book was recalled from shelves due to the immediate outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, in an event of sheer coincidence or of the very parapsychological abilities (though, precognitive, rather than auditory) the author herself was exploring in the work"

This quote is taken from page 23 of Red, Ring, Parallel, the unreleased journal, written about in page 323, footnote 23, within the accompanying written material to the Immersive Art installation made by the woman in the wallpaper

in the dream, i was a child again. 
Again, I was a child, in the dream. 
And as a child, care-free, my dreams were small 
And I, small again, dreamed i could be free, with the other children I once cared for
Forbearing not, I had not planned, but happened to be sharing with my friends for a small get-together 
And letting them in one by one, then two by two, then four by six by twelve
My father gone, and in his place, my Mother with another 
Father of my friend, my oldest friend, not by time but timeline
And I was happy with my friends, dancing in that small, small room 
The bedroom where, at one point, all points, converging into reading
Reading into dreaming, waking up to write small words, that grew into a cancer 
A cancer of insistence of my Stories on Becoming 
Becoming Story, lie, a lyre, I laid inside so many books, got lost inside them 

The mirrors of my youth, refracting lenses of Becoming 
Reflecting on this dream, my dreams of childhood and my longing 
I was the Starting of a Song so wrongly Strangled into Silence 
And Shrunk, and head-shrunk, life-sapped, crest-fallen on word-swords and other S-words 

And the bedroom of the child I was, the bookcase that had floated as a dagger o'er my dreaming
still held the books now gone and given to some unknown soul, i hope, or worse, rotting in a landfill 
Relinquished 
reliquaries


And the music of the child I was, the CD floating shelf that held the Songs I wished I was, and tried to write, but couldn't fit the words I'd birthed, with worse, the melodies that burst out from my heart like beaten bulbs, and pulses, insects

none of this would fit together

in the dream, i was the child I am, 

the piece of plastic I'd become

splintered off the corner 
of a poorly mixed cassette tape 

I am the child and children I'd not planned to host 
a party of a part 
a colony of parasites

And this palimpsest 
	of palimpsest, 
								partition,
 impression of my father, 
 an Othering another's
Heard my music, played by us, on a small, small, CD player 
that tapping on my chamber door just made my heart swell louder 
And turned it up, Become the loudness, that I did, I turned it up turned up into my Becoming
He shouted over all the joy of racket, batting down the basement hatch I'd shrivelled into
And battled down the door and entered, 
And screamed I was not welcome 
And then my friends were filtered out
Bacteria, Breath, now done with
But I was left there, in the mess 
to deal with cards I'm dealt with 

in the dream, knot-Father told me I was to leave the bedroom 
and leave the hall and down the stairs and out the door and past the pebble-dashing 

with screaming Urgency he told me that I was to sleep on the street, as if my unplanned gathering, was a murder of a child,
and crowing thrice his sharpest sentence he gave me barely any time to collect my things
for some semblance of a warmness round my exile 

He shouted down the stairs, now in my sister's bedroom, or the top-floor bathroom, to my Mother asking
If I'd gone yet, or if he needed to come down and force my exit 


And then she came in, and I'd hoped, 
that futile hope that has now died, but still survived, 
in my dream I still housed a hope of better 
of betterment that I may bring the world, my Self, 
in the long since broken promise of adulthood 


and in the dream my mother, at my doorway, did not help me 
she screamed much louder than the stranger in my childhood home 
where once I'd dreamed in books and songs of artists as a dreamer 
dreaming of the the art I'd make, for belief's sake, 
but my mother left, and in the dream, insisted on my leaving 
screaming 

again, a child, a dream, 
now woken from 
i was a child 


i am

[^1]:Out Out Briefest  Story  Stretching back  Stretching out  Out brief  Burning  {REDACTED} I could say it is wax being poured down my throat, making me dry heave like your cock used to, but you don’t deserve the fucking metaphor. There is no romance to how you pulverised everything that once glowed in an orange flicker.
