*by The Pawn.* 

I arrived in the garden

And a {bee}
Was
{REDACTED} me about  
{REDACTED} a lion with a carcass in its jaw  
And I told them I loved them  
And then it shrunk  into a child

 BEHIND THE WATERFALL

Is a blackening tunnel  
And the blackening it yellows
beckons in a pink sepia sky becoming visible  
And a figure pulls me through  
{REDACTED}  
Reaches into the tunnel  
And pulls me into the underworld  
By my arm  
And we are dancing together

_Part 23 of the Literary Critique podcast discussing The Woman In The Wallpaper's final novel, "Phage 23" {do knot, cite yore} Source: An unreleased journal, RED_RING_PARALLEL {REDACTED}, aired within one room of a Six Room immersive and ambitious art installation too tragically ahead of its time. The journal entry itself focuses on the book's content, and its controversial withdrawal. This Podcast was the first time the Work has been discussed publicly, and (following the outcry which {REDACTED} its release) was subsequently (within three seconds {of the dream {of a single {fly|drosophila| fly, fly, fly}} {REDACTED}from streaming{REDACTED}forms_

> "Author ⧖, in their musicological analysis of 'Phage 23' explored a deeply intricate and complicated exploration of an alternate universe mentioned in *RED_RING_PARALLEL*, in which a terrifyingly deadly virus (therefore, terrible at the intended function of its own survival) devoured the world's population, leaving One member of the population with a superhuman ability of hearing. The book was recalled from shelves due to the immediate outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, in an event of harrowing similarity to the very parapsychological themes (though, precognitive, rather than auditory) the author herself was exploring in the work"

[^1]:Out Out Briefest  Story  Stretching back  Stretching out  Out brief  Burning  {REDACTED} I could say it is wax being poured down my throat, making me dry heave like your cock used to, but you don’t deserve the fucking metaphor. There is no romance to how you pulverised everything that once glowed in an orange flicker.
