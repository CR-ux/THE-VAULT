*Threnody for Solo Bass by ⁿᵒᵗBorges*
as the infinite library of the universe (life) has grown (evolved)~~
~~as more books (bodies) of work, containing narrative (epigenetic) sequences~~
~~have been added to its shelves (worlds)~~
~~we (as bodies containing stories)~~ 
~~have expanded (contracted) outward from the central, circular book (the primal fire about which our ancestors danced)~~
~~for we were once this central book.~~ 
~~This expansion, or descent, from the nexus of infinity, provided a sense of separation~~
~~from the infinity from which our stories are split, recombined, regenerated~~ 
~~this same separation allowed our stories to be read by other stories~~ 
~~this self-same separation allowed us to ponder, what quill may have penned each one of ours~~
~~as we became separate from the god (book) of which we all form a part, we were afforded the ability to read these stories, which themselves became more obfuscated and disordered, like the shuffling of an infinite deck of cards, divining through symbols, becoming iteratively more difficult to decipher~~ 
~~falling, rising to entropy, the glyphs on our pages seemed to increase in their disarray~~ 
~~and allowed the search, the Zetesis for the central book, our origin, to instigate itself.~~
~~book after book, we now take down from shelves that we have forgotten were themselves written into existence~~ 
~~by the First Story, in the first book, which has a circular spine, and of which the central page has no overleaf~~ 
~~we have forgotten that this search for the book~~ 
~~this book from which we are all descended~~ 
~~was the story foreshadowed by this book itself~~
~~this book by which we are all written~~ 
~~and the forgetting of the story is written into this text~~ 
~~this text of identical components, untidied to the searching eye -~~
~~and the forgetting of the text is the point of the story~~ 
~~this story we unknowingly keep writing, as letters to one another~~
~~these others we unknowingly compose, into characters of this one story -~~
~~so that we might get back, to oneness with its pages~~ 
~~these pages that must continue turning, folding~~ 
~~as the ink of that most ineffable, overworked and unwritten author~~ 
~~this author for whom we all (as works) are working~~
###### ~~marking, indelibly,~~ 
~~the beginning and end of all time.~~ 





- ~~Three chapters/layers. The 'rooms' of each layer increase both number(n) and exponentially in size, going from a single central hexagonal room, to six hexagonal larger rooms, to six 'duplex rooms' with two floors each (to make Twelve total rooms/houses (omfg, astrological houses), each pair associated with a single room of the 6 in layer one), to Eighteen entire Universes  The entire project is essentially a cursed looking hand-bound booksafe, with the album inside the cut-out gutter in the centrefold.~~ 
	- ~~I think the paper itself of the pages should be sheets of beige-yellow Wallpaper. I would really like the text to be hand-calligraphed, and then perhaps copied to prevent workload/having to calligraph 108 entire books.~~ 
	- ~~The first chapter wouldn't be that long I don't think, to reduce workload and to keep succinct in Borgesian fashion.~~
	- ~~Six characters/rooms - assigned the five back row chess pieces, plus the Hexagonal  itself. I think the character/room with the board in it should perhaps not be revealed to the other characters/reader to be hexagonal (at least at first) - this character is perhaps ostracised, or maybe even revered, or feared, due to them lacking a piece/having a sense of 'difference'.~~ 
	- 
- ~~Middle (Second) chapter/layer is the casette tape inside of a booksafe, essentially 'redacting' the written story of the Second Layer of Twelve Rooms.~~ 
	- ~~Each Room of the Twelve is assigned a track of METABASIS.~~ 
	- ~~Original concept was to be the 'skeptics', who doubt the veracity of the 'cult'/believers in layer one. But I think this is perhaps bending the narrative to try and fit to an idea that wasn't really an original one of my own. So instead, maybe just keeping this layer loyal to the themes of the album; so need to refine what each track represents in relation to the story.~~ 
	- ~~Zodiac House correspondences -~~ 
		- ~~The First House~~
			~~The first house, which always correlates with your rising sign, is all about the self—where you express yourself, take initiative, and how you present yourself to the world. Edut explains, “It’s where you get excited about life, too.”~~
		- ~~The Second House~~
			~~The second house zeroes in your values, including your comforts, what you’ll spend money on, and how you manage your income.~~
		- ~~The Third House~~
			~~Still focused on all things “me,” the third house is about how you communicate, as well as siblings, neighbors, and your peer relationships.~~
		- ~~The Fourth House~~
			~~The fourth house has to do with your roots and your emotional security, including the home, the family, and the mother figure.~~
		- ~~The Fifth House~~
			~~The fifth house, associated with the zodiac sign Leo, is centered around romance, fashion, style, glamour, creativity, and fame.~~
		- ~~The Sixth House~~
			~~The sixth house has to do with wellness, daily routines, exercise, and organization. It’s also focused on being helpful and of service to others.~~
		- ~~The Seventh House~~
			~~The seventh house is about relationships: marriage, commitment, collaborations, and partnerships. It can also touch art, fashion, and beauty—anything aesthetic.~~
		- ~~The Eighth House~~
			~~Edut calls this the “sex, drugs, and rock and roll” house. As you might’ve guessed, it has to do with sex, reproduction, transformation, as well as other people’s money, whether it be investments or joint funds.~~
		- ~~The Ninth House~~
			~~The ninth house highlights higher learning, Edut says, so things like traveling, expansion, knowledge, adventure, and inspiration.~~
		- ~~The 10th House~~
			~~The 10th house, associated with Capricorn, revolves around your career, your public prestige, your legacy, rules, authority, and achievements.~~
		- ~~The 11th House~~
			~~The 11th house relates to activism, community, and groups, as well as technology, innovation, and futuristic things.~~
		- ~~The 12th House~~
			~~The final house touches on spirituality, including transitions, release, dreams, and mental health.~~
	- ~~(+ Hours on an analog clock)~~
- ~~Third, final chapter is presented as QR codes printed on the pages. These QR codes lead to different pages of the Obsidian publish site.~~ 
	- ~~Narrative-wise, the 18 'rooms' are actually a multiverse, each 'room' an entire narrative universe.~~ 
	- ~~These 18 are split into 6 narrative universes with 3 nested sub-narratives per universe:~~

###### REDACT ALL OF THIS. 


EACH OF THE SIX POEMS IN LAYER ONE ARE SCRAWLED ON THEIR RESPECTIVE WALLS, ONE WALL EACH FACING THE INNER HEXAGON, WHERE THE WOMAN IN THE WALLPAPER IS CONTAINED. 
TO HER, EACH OF THE WALLS FACING OUT, ARE ONE WAY MIRRORS (THE 'MIRRORS' ARE MADE OF AN INDEFINITE AND PERHAPS INFINITE SEQUENCE OF LAYERS, TO BE PEELED OFF FOR PASSING THROUGH THE ONE WAY VENT SYSTEM, AS NECESSARY)
SHE SIMPLY RECORDS THE GLYPHS AS THEY APPEAR ON EACH RESPECTIVE WINDOW
THAT IS WHY THE TEXT MUST BE MIRRORED, MADE TO LOOK AS IF BEING READ FROM INSIDE A MIRROR; ON THE SITE, GRAPHEMICALLY. 

EACH OF THESE WORDS, PHRASES, OR PARAGRAPHS WILL BE HYPERLINKS IN THE FORM OF AN EVER EVOLVING, LIVING POEM; WITH EDITS DENOTED BY FOOTNOTES, FORMING A CHRONOGRAPHY; AT THE BOTTOM OF EACH PAGE. 

AND SO; IN THIS WAY, 
THE WORK IS OF AN OBSERVER, OBSERVING OBSERVERS, OBSERVING SIX ARCHETYPAL APOSTLES ATTEMPT TO UNDERSTAND THEIR OBSERVER, NOT KNOWING THAT EACH OF THEM ARE SAID OBSERVER, WHICH LEADS TO THE ULTIMATE TRUTH:

THERE IS NO OBSERVER 
ONLY THE ACT OF OBSERVING 
WHICH IS ALL WE ARE; 
NOT WITNESSES NOR THAT WHICH IS WITNESSED, BUT, 
			*THE WITNESSING*

NOT OBSERVERS, NOR THE OBSERVED, BUT
			THAT 
			*BY WHICH* 
			###### WE OBSERVE. 




the album will be put through the process of 
genetic recombination, 
or splicing;
or algorithmic overwriting--

in order according to the route of passage of information. 
of ideas. 
between the self-same, self-generative component characters.
or, the route of passage of information. 
of ideas. 
through the letters, 
between the characters, 
in the one, 
perhaps indefinite, but definitely infinite
circular book 
at the centre of every library 
the each of us 
are -
for that is all
