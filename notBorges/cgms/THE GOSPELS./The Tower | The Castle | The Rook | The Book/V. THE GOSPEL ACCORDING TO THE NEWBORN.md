by The Rook
i could not close the windows.
screens of blood, distorted faces 
distorting my own in turn 
there was a bunk bed, missing its bottom partner 
in its place was a cavernous absence 
where my childhood lay 
the room was accessible by a fireplace 
with no other entrance or exit 
it led out to a classroom 
which contained peers now forgotten 
in waking, in sleep 
in dreadful, encompassing sleep 
i was trying to close the windows 
on this inexplicable screen 
my mother, complaining about 
the price of being touched 
by another human 
while i, a child 
comforted and reassured her 
a friend i'd made in the final days 
of my stay at the Winged Garden 
where I'd played the piano for her 
and had the intimacy snatched 
by the interrupting worry of a nurse 
the doors of the chapel there, never closed properly 
but i had opened the body of the piano 
like my body had been opened 
as two heavy oak doors 
creaking in such resonant betrayal. 
there was a mess of juttinng sharpness, 
above that hearth door in my mind's heart 
either I, or an eye I could not see 
had placed it there, to keep something out 
that was trying to get in
a mentor, of uncertain name 
had passed me some green liquid, 
which I drank, greedily 
knowing she expected me to recoil in disgust
it became a stupid game, then 
to stomach in spoils of silence, 
not give away my disgust 
for fear of losing 
something 
a stupid game
i won nothing 
but the farewell of isolation 
an undoubtably male figure, now pushed against its floating in memory, 
like a hollow skull bone batted by the paws of a cat 
or the hands of a panicking child drowning 
or the sticks to be placed beneath a woman bound 
to a stick of sturdier girth
the one mirroring her internal column, incrementally less exposed, more open
as she burns to her boiling death 
the figure had a weapon 
a heavy, bludgeoning tool 
he advanced upon my mother, and the fellow patient whom i'd called my friend 
someone supposed to keep me safe 
and another i had failed to 
this diseased trinity 
had not long to live 
i could not close those windows 
showing images of ripped apart faces 
and things i am still, in my terrible age, 
too young to know
i was certain we were all about to die 
escaping the scene and all its potential 
crawling back through the treacherous dark of that fireplace 
i found myself again alone 
and awaited the fate that befell the others 
but instead of the nameless and terrifying man 
came a troll, or a goblin, a grotesque 
in the margins of my dream's manuscript 
i saw him enter through the opening 
and i knew why 
the light, it burned my face -
i could not close those windows 
on waking i twist my spine to the right 
(i had fallen asleep upside down)
and peer out of the window i'd left open 
into the frost of the road 
and further, upward 
through the frost of my crusted left eye 
i see the library 
lights on 
doors closed 
inside, i think i see a trash bin 
i think i see people moving 
i want to see people, something moving in there 
i want to see the drollery, the demon
tearing stories from the pages
