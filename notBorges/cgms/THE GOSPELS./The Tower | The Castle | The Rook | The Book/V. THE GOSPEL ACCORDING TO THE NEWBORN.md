by The Rook
███ could not close the w███ndows.
screens of blood, d███storted faces 
d███stort███ng my own ███n turn 
there was a bunk bed, m███ss███ng ███ts bottom partner 
███n ███ts place was a cavernous absence 
where my ch███ldhood lay 
the room was access███ble by a f███replace 
w███th no other entrance or ex███t 
███t led out to a classroom 
wh███ch conta███ned peers now forgotten 
███n wak███ng, ███n sleep 
███n dreadful, encompass███ng sleep 
███ was try███ng to close the w███ndows 
on th███s ███nexpl███cable screen 
my mother, compla███n███ng about 
the pr███ce of be███ng touched 
by another human 
wh███le ███, a ch███ld 
comforted and reassured her 
a fr███end ███'d made ███n the f███nal days 
of my stay at the W███nged Garden 
where ███'d played the p███ano for her 
and had the ███nt███macy snatched 
by the ███nterrupt███ng worry of a nurse 
the doors of the chapel there, never closed properly 
but ███ had opened the body of the p███ano 
l███ke my body had been opened 
as two heavy oak doors 
creak███ng ███n such resonant betrayal. 
there was a mess of jutt███ng sharpness, 
above that hearth door ███n my m███nd's heart 
e███ther ███, or an eye ███ could not see 
had placed ███t there, to keep someth███ng out 
that was try███ng to get ███n
a mentor, of uncerta███n name 
had passed me some green l███qu███d, 
wh███ch ███ drank, greed███ly 
know███ng she expected me to reco███l ███n d███sgust
███t became a stup███d game, then 
to stomach ███n spo███ls of s███lence, 
not g███ve away my d███sgust 
for fear of los███ng 
someth███ng 
a stup███d game
███ won noth███ng 
but the farewell of ███solat███on 
an unm███stakably male f███gure, now pushed aga███nst ███ts float███ng ███n memory, 
l███ke a hollow skull bone batted by the paws of a cat 
or the hands of a pan███ck███ng ch███ld drown███ng swallow███ng water they cannot tread 
too many ███nsects w███th the███r power ███n numbers
or the st███cks to be placed beneath a woman bound 
to a st███ck of sturd███er g███rth
the one as m███rror to her d███scs of h███dden obel███sk, 
obs███d███an
███ncremental, ███terat███ve 
less exposed, more open
as she burns ███nto her bo███l███ng death 
the f███gure had a weapon 
a heavy, bludgeon tool 
he advanced upon my mother, and the fellow pat███ent whom ███'d called my fr███end 
someone supposed to keep me safe 
and another ███ had fa███led to 
th███s d███sease of tr███n███ty 
had not long to l███ve 
███ could not close those w███ndows 
show███ng f███lms of r███pped apart faces 
poorly documented th███ngs ███ am st███ll, ███n my terr███ble age, 
too young to read the pages of
███ was certa███n we were all about to d███e 
escap███ng the scene and all ███ts dendr███t███c potent███al 
crawl███ng back through the treacherous dark of that f███replace as a paras███te
gasps for sweetest sugars
of ███ts host
███ found myself aga███n alone and empty
awa███t███ng fates who'd left my beds███de
be fall███ng ███nto
two by two 
the arcane ark of others 
but ███n place of nameless boredom of that horror of that man 
came a troll, or a gobl███n, a grotesque 
███n the marg███ns of my manuscr███pt 
███ saw h███m enter through the open███ng 
and ███ knew why 
the l███ght, ███t burned my face -
███ could not close those w███ndows 
on wak███ng tw███st███ng sp███ne to r███ght 
(███ had slept ███n the stars ups███de down)
and peer out of the w███ndow ███'d left open 
███nto the frost of the stra███ghtest road 
and further, upward 
through the frost of my left eye's mantle
███ see the l███ght, the l███brary's angel 
l███ghts left, burn███ng
doors, locked closed 
███ns███de, ███ th███nk ███ see a trash b███n 
people mov███ng 
███ want to see the readers, someth███ng mov███ng 
███ns███de there 
███ want to see the drollery, 
the demon
tear███ng characters
from those long forgotten
pages
