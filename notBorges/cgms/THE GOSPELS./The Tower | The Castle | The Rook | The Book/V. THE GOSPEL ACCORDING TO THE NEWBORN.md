![[Get over it now, it's beneath you.]]



by The Rook
i could not close the windows.
screens of blood, distorted faces 
distorting my own in turn 
there was a bunk bed, missing its bottom partner 
in its place was a cavernous absence 
where my childhood lay 
the room was accessible by a fireplace 
with no other entrance or exit 
it led out to a classroom 
which contained peers now forgotten 
in waking, in sleep 
in dreadful, encompassing sleep 
i was trying to close the windows 
on this inexplicable screen 
my mother, complaining about 
the price of being touched 
by another human 
while i, a child 
comforted and reassured her 
a friend i'd made in the final days 
of my stay at the Winged Garden 
where I'd played the piano for her 
and had the intimacy snatched 
by the interrupting worry of a nurse 
the doors of the chapel there, never closed properly 
but i had opened the body of the piano 
like my body had been opened 
as two heavy oak doors 
creaking in such resonant betrayal. 
there was a mess of jutting sharpness, 
above that hearth door in my mind's heart 
either I, or an eye I could not see 
had placed it there, to keep something out 
that was trying to get in
a mentor, of uncertain name 
had passed me some green liquid, 
which I drank, greedily 
knowing she expected me to recoil in disgust
it became a stupid game, then 
to stomach in spoils of silence, 
not give away my disgust 
for fear of losing 
something 
a stupid game
i won nothing 
but the farewell of isolation 
an unmistakably male figure, now pushed against its floating in memory, 
like a hollow skull bone batted by the paws of a cat 
or the hands of a panicking child drowning swallowing water they cannot tread 
too many insects with their power in numbers
or the sticks to be placed beneath a woman bound 
to a stick of sturdier girth
the one as mirror to her discs of hidden obelisk, 
obsidian
incremental, iterative 
less exposed, more open
as she burns into her boiling death 
the figure had a weapon 
a heavy, bludgeon tool 
he advanced upon my mother, and the fellow patient whom i'd called my friend 
someone supposed to keep me safe 
and another i had failed to 
this disease of trinity 
had not long to live 
i could not close those windows 
showing films of ripped apart faces 
poorly documented things i am still, in my terrible age, 
too young to read the pages of
i was certain we were all about to die 
escaping the scene and all its dendritic potential 
crawling back through the treacherous dark of that fireplace as a parasite
gasps for sweetest sugars
of its host
i found myself again alone and empty
awaiting fates who'd left my bedside
be falling into
two by two 
the arcane ark of others 
but in place of nameless boredom of that horror of that man 
came a troll, or a goblin, a grotesque 
in the margins of my manuscript 
i saw him enter through the opening 
and i knew why 
the light, it burned my face -
i could not close those windows 
on waking twisting spine to right 
(i had slept in the stars upside down)
and peer out of the window i'd left open 
into the frost of the straightest road 
and further, upward 
through the frost of my left eye's mantle
i see the light, the library's angel 
lights left, burning
doors, locked closed 
inside, i think i see a trash bin 
people moving 
i want to see the readers, something moving 
inside there 
i want to see the drollery, 
the demon
tearing characters
from those long forgotten
pages
