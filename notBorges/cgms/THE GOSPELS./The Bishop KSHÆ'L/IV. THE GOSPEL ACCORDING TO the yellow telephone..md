Who are these people at the bridge to meet me? {REDACTED} the agent for bees.  
{REDACTED}  I have no protection,  
And they are {REDACTED}  why did nobody tell me?  
They are smiling and taking out veils tacked to ancient hats.  
  
I am nude {REDACTED}  does nobody love me?  
Yes, here is the secretary of bees{REDACTED} the bees will not notice.  
They will not smell my fear, my fear, my fear.  
  
Which is the rector now, is it that man in {REDACTED}?  
Which is the midwife, is that {REDACTED}  a square {REDACTED} head, they are knights {REDACTED} 
  {REDACTED}  a sea of bean flowers,  
Creamy bean flowers with {REDACTED} eyes and leaves like bored hearts.  
Is it blood clots the tendrils are dragging up that string?  
No, no, it is scarlet flowers that will one day be {REDACTED}.  
  
{REDACTED} And a {REDACTED} veil that molds to my face, they are making me one of them.  
They are leading me to {REDACTED} , the circle of hives.  
{REDACTED} so sick?  
The barren body{REDACTED} , {REDACTING} its children.  
  
Is it some operation that is taking place?  
It is the surgeon {REDACTED}  waiting for,  
This apparition {REDACTED} 
Is it the butcher, the grocer, the postman, someone {REDACTED}  
  
I cannot run, I am rooted, and {REDACTED}  
With its yellow {REDACTED} 
I could not run without having to run forever.  
The white hive is snug as a virgin,  
Sealing off her brood cells, her honey, and quietly {REDACTED}  
  
Smoke rolls and scarves in the grove.  
The mind of the hive thinks this is the end of everything.  
Here they come, {REDACTED}   
If I stand very still, they will think I am {REDACTED}  
A {REDACTED} head untouched by their animosity,  
  {REDACTED}  open the chambers, they are hunting the queen.  
Is she {REDACTED} eating honey? She is {REDACTED} 
She is old, old, old, she must live another year, and she knows it.  {REDACTED} 
Dream of a duel they will win inevitably,  
A curtain of wax [^l] dividing them from the bride flight,  
The upflight of the murderess into a heaven that loves her.  
{REDACTED}   
The old queen does not show herself, is she so ungrateful?  
  
I am exhausted, I am exhausted ——  
Pillar of white in a {REDACTED}out of knives.  
I am the{REDACTED} girl who does not flinch.  
The villagers are untying their disguises, they are shaking hands.  
Whose is that {REDACTED} box in the grove, what have they accomplished, why am I cold.[^s]
