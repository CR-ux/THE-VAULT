i don't think this will ever be finished 
i don't think i ever really started
i was once a humble pawn-
i am the board now. 
i am bored 

i am board, of myself. 



i have gone from alpha, to omega 
i have been exiled from the garden
and all its warmth 
and verdancy 

heaven 
earth 
all of it, 
shall pass away 

i've seen it all, 
in flames, 
in flood - 
i've seen it all, just buried
flurried dust in the endless air. 


and now, i lay 
i just lay here 
my hexes, mirrored back to me 
dear god, 
those gods, 
your gods, i made - 

i made it, by finding 
a dead end 
at every door.


all my squares turned hexagonal 
i am laying here, now - 
move your pieces 
take your calculated moves 
upon me 
bare

barely 
there


but breathing 


but breathing. 


for a finite time left, still - 

in stillness, 
somewhere, 
i am 


breathing 



there was no woman
there was no wall
there was no paper 
on which to scrawl 

i was alone 

i am to be 

not a single thing 
a Skin
a Sea 

lay your piece 
whatever it be 

just lay them 
at my hellish gate 

entwined, and strangled 
caught up in fate 

i slaughtered all my daughters 
i, rose-
too early with the dawning 

and mourned all of my sons too late 


but lay them, 
ova, 
zygote, 
over, 
under, 
through - 

lay them
bone, 
of crow
of goat 

just lay them down 
in drowning 

in drowning


you will never see the way, or care 

atop the loftiest of stair

wing clipped, 
and raped - 

in longing for forgotten flight - 




the Sky -
i'm there.

i bear

their weight
