- THE ALBUM (METABASIS: notBorges)
- twelve tracks of a triple physical cassette release, the first under the notBorges moniker
- track lengths following the fibonacci sequence, and a tape loop in a mobius strip in the centre, forming the centrefold. 
- the three tapes are to be encased within a booksafe, titled The Children's Gospel Music Songbook. it will be released under the Venalism label, a label very very close to my heart; based in Edinburgh.
- it is a physical artefact representing the first iteration/edition of the works presented here, on this site
- each run of copies, should it get to that point, will contain updated editions, to reflect the current state of the 'literature' the reader may view here. 
- this purposely parodies the farce of printed academic textbooks editions, collecting and updating the iterations of new discoveries from the fundamentally clergical and hermetically sealed, initiated 'wisdom' of academic literature, behind a farcical paywall denoting farcical circumstance or farcical academic "training".
