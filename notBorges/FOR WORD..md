Within the Grounds of this Hospital
I found nothing there but Dirt, 
The Home of Garden Wing, 
Wings Broken of the Dead Pigeon I buried there, where the thorns did draw their symbols on my Ankle. 


Within this Garden, 
I planted Three Seeds, or maybe even more; 
The Trees Hold my Secrets;
Within the Trees, within the dirt, the rot, decay; 

I left clues recorded on casette tapes.
I buried them 
I am within
