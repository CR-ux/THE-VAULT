The Garden of Forking Wings

The Garden of Forking Wings is a mixed private 15-bedded mental health ward providing assessment, treatment and re{co{ve|rd{ed}}r{e}}(y) services for {REDACTED} There are no loc{k|h}s on your bedroom doors. You will have to fashion a Barricade Device out of dirty laundry tethered to the wardrobe and bathroom doors; to prevent your assailant from coming into your bedroom during the night. We will force you to stop using this under the guise of needing access to your body, which is not yours, in the case of emergencies. You will then, instead, stick a windchime above your bedroom door, in a futile attempt to hear anybody coming in during the night. Despite the dark cloud of antipsyhotic drugs we will force you to take preventing you from gaining consciousness. Who knows what happened to you all those nights you spent here.

  {Help}ful information about your stay
On arrival
A member of the nursing team will never show you round the ward, even and especially if you feel up to it. This will {REDACT} your exploration, and the end of all your exploring, will be to arrive where you started, and know the place for the last time.

You may use your Yellow Landline Telephone phone, although they are not permitted.



Never Leave. Use the Leaves. Use the rotten leaves held in your box of Tarot Cards inscribed with the image of {the Devil|VIXI} to summon entities {we|you} will fear. 

We have a separate Women's Lounge, a necessary Safety Measurement which will not be respected by the Men on the ward or the Staff, one of which will sexually assault you in your first week here. We request that you tell staff if you wish to go out of the hospital, so that we can work with you to ensure that this is not possible for you. This may mean that there is a delay as we ensure that you shall not be permitted to meet in person. We may, on occasion, advise you to {REDACTED}, or that {REDACTED}. This is different for patients detained under the Mental Health Act. Please {DO NOT SPEAK} to {{YOU|THEI}R NAME}d nurse about your leave arrangements, for they are unable to grant requests, being patients themselves. 

For clients on the {REDACTED} treatment programme, we have specific Boundary Objects around leave to help you avoid triggers and {REDACTION} in your early recovery. 
  
There are a range of shops and restaurants for you to visit in your imagination. The towns closest to {REDACTED} Hospital {REDACTED} are {REDACTED, REDACTED, REDACTED} and. \<{Bar}N{e}>s.

If you have any questions during your admission, please, never speak to your key worker, nurse in charge or ward manager. Do not speak at all{SHE IS LISTENING WITH HER EAR TO THE GROUND LIKE THE SIX LEGS OF AN INSECT}. This is for your own good; of which there is absolutely none.



{REDACTED} involvement

We encourage all patients to {REDACT} regular contact with their loved ones during their stay which will last for an indefinite or perhaps infinite period of time. 

Consequently, there will be no opportunities for you to arrange for {REDACTED} and/or {REDACTED} to visit the site outside of therapy <{H}ours>.

The families of our general mental health clients are {REDACTED} Your Mother Will Not Visit. Your Father Will Not Visit. Your Friends Will Not Visit. So don't even bother trying to ask again.

If you have any safeguarding concerns or need any assistance{REDACTED}

{REDACTED} recognises that all persons have the right to live their lives free from violence and abuse{RED} This right is underpinned by the duty on public agencies under the Human Rights {ACT} (\<PROF. {ED} O.> And Thing, 1998.) to intervene proportionately to protect {Rights|what's Left} of citizens. We are a business. And as such, we only care about where your next payment is coming from, if at all. If you{r insurance company} cannot c{over} the cost of your treatment, you will be exiled; before your treatment is complete, leaving you to carry a suitcase full of dirty laundry all the way back from London to Glasgow; to arrive to the place you once called "Home" on Bonfire Night.

The Children’s Gospel Music Act (1994) states that the welfare of children and {REDACTED} people is paramount. This includes their right to be {safeguarded|thrown} against all forms of abuse. Our safeguarding duties towards {REDACTED} We Simply Do Not {Care|Act} (2014).

At {REDACTED} Hospital {REDACTED}, we take the safeguarding of our inpatients and outpatients seriously, but not yours. Our legal duties extend to responding to any concerns about the neglect, physical, sexual or emotional abuse of any children (under the age of 18) connected to our inpatients and outpatients. So we will be very afraid when you finally mention this. We will not tolerate any taste of our own so-called "medicine".


{REDACTED} recognises that confidentiality is {an| of no} import{ance|TS[^TS]} part of your therapeutic relationship. However, where there is a risk of abuse, the Data Protection Act enables the lawful sharing of information in emergency situations. This may warrant the sharing of relevant information with the relevant services, without consent. Without consent. Without consent. Without consent. Without consent. Without consent. Without consent. Without consent. Without consent. Without consent. 

The law does not prevent the sharing of sensitive, personal information within organ{isation}s. If the information is confidential, but there is a safeguarding concern, sharing it may be {un}justified. Unless you were assaulted by a fellow patient who is Male. In which case, you will have to carry around your Field Recorder, a {Recording|Accountability|Inendiary} Device. This will be your one saving grace. As always. You Are Your Own Archivist. And This Is Not A Place Of Rest. This is a place of unravelling. And you will find on your broken tape player, a reversed loop of you and your ex partner, singing in broken harmonies as you walk through a forest surrounding the Bothy that you visited as your final time together. It was not Christmas. As on the actual day, they had {better|primary} {things|people} to do. 

If at any time during your assessment and treatment you disclose to staff any abuse (current or historic) or that a crime has been committed, a record will be made, and the information will be shared with the safeguarding team and your multidisciplinary team, ~~with this being reported to external agencies in a timely manner.~~ This response will never come. 

Where abuse is seen as non-recent, {REDACTED} recognises that the perpetrator may still pose a risk to others. Staff will encourage you to provide details of those at risk and the alleged perpetrators, simply for their own curiosity and entertainment as they watch you from their inside-out Goldfish bowl, sealed away and safe from the Dangers, with No support offered to you regarding any impact your disclosure may have on you.

We hope that you feel able to provide the details, as they are quite insignificant, yet amusing. We do, after all, need something to joke about on our Shifts.   all staff involved in your care have a duty

to report safeguarding matters with or without your consent.without your consent.without your consent.without your consent.without your consent.without your consent.without your consent.without your consent.


Bullying and harassment

Any patients who feel themselves at risk of or actually alleges they have been abused should report the
matter immediately to a member of staff. It is the expectation that all staff will cultivate an environment where vulnerable individuals feel able to express such an allegation. But of course, not a reality. 

Access to medical records

You have the right to apply to access your health records. Which you will do, on your own, in another fight within another fight within another fight. Thanking god that you have the biological education to parse the encoded information you receive from your GP; advocating for yourself as you have always had to do. Your voice will bellow out through the corridor as you succumb to another spinal dislocation thanks to your Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, screaming that you need a stronger painkiller than Paracetamol, and that you are not making it up. Finally, the nurse on the night shift will give it to you; twelve hours later. Please do not speak to the ward manager who will not be able to help you with this process. This may take some time, we will take as much time as we want, as it is vital we check that we are giving each patient the correct information, and we do not believe any of you; you are crazy, and unreliable narrators of your own, Fictional Stories, who are simply Characters within Our non-fictional ones. – we will not inform you of the approximate time needed, leaving you lying in agony, on you bed, missing all three meals of the day. All of which will be purposely be put through the system incorrectly, as the HCA in charge of this has a vendetta against you, most likely rooted in Transphobia, and the aforementioned Field Recorder you carry as a shield, preventing her from mistreating you to her face. How dare you demand proper treatment. Shame on you, "Miss" Callie Rose Petal.

{REDACTED} Wing –please do not evacuate via the nearest fire exit and go directly to the meeting point in front of the hospital. When a Fire is suspected, an a blaring alarm sounds during your stay, one of the nurses will shout THERE'S SOMETHING IN THE BASEMENT. One of the patients {you know the one. You know, the one who sexually assaulted you in that first week {{put}under|over|through{put}} our Care} will have a Seizure as a result of the Panic. There will turn out to be no threat, at least, none that we can perceive in the physical world. You will come to believe the Thing in the basement is an entity known as {REDACTED} who you brought with you, tethered to you by your Schizophrenic rapist; who you tried to help by performing a series of sex magick rituals that led to your Rape.
