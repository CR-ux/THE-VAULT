{REDACTED} Court

{REDACTED} Court is a mixed private 16-bedded mental health ward providing assessment, treatment and recovery services for {REDACTED} aged 18 years and over.

The Garden of Forking Wings

The Garden of Forking Wings is a mixed private 15-bedded mental health ward providing assessment, treatment and recovery services for {REDACTED} aged 18 years and over. There are no locks on your bedroom doors. You will have to fashion a Barricade Device out of dirty laundry tethered to the wardrobe and bathroom doors; to prevent your assailant from coming into your bedroom during the night. We will force you to stop using this under the guise of needing access to your body, which is not yours, in the case of emergencies. You will then, instead, stick a windchime above your bedroom door, in a futile attempt to hear anybody coming in during the night. Despite the dark cloud of antipsyhotic drugs we will force you to take preventing you from gaining consciousness. Who knows what happened to you all those nights you spent here.

  Helpful information about your stay

On arrival

A member of the nursing team will never show you round the ward, even and especially if you feel up to it. This will {REDACT} your exploration, and the end of all your exploring, will be to arrive where you started, and know the place for the last time.

The doctor will {REDACT} your medical records. You will never see or know yourself again. This is for your benefit.


Your care team

On admission to the ward, you will be under the care of a consultant psychiatrist. You will be assigned a unnamed nursed and The Rapist. 

The Rapists on each floor of The Hospital are there to keep you in place. {REDACTED} will induct you onto the {REDACTED} programme 23 <{H}ours> from admission.

We also have a team of Characters, all of which are Unforgivable.[^u]

(HCAs) working throughout every day and night, receiving regular handovers about your progress and care. In the nursing office, there will always be staff to assist you in any way. Please don’t hesitate to knock at any time.

Who’s who?

Consultant psychiatrist

Your consultant is the lead doctor with overall responsibility for your care and treatment during

your stay in the hospital. They will meet with you regularly and make important decisions about your care/treatment, eventually leading to your discharge plan. You will have the opportunity to be involved in discussions about this. Your wishes will be carefully listened to and treatment will have your agreement. The days and times your consultant will meet with you can vary according to who is treating you. The nursing team and ward doctors are in constant communication with the consultants and their secretaries. If you have any concerns, please ask a member of the nursing team.

Ward doctors or senior house officers (SHOs)

SHOs are junior doctors training to be GPs who change on a three to six-month rotation. They work Monday

to Friday, 9am-5pm. Ward doctors are available to you on the ward with regards to your physical and mental health. During the admission process, you will have been clerked in by one of them.

It’s really helped me to understand the pressures and put names to the conditions that I have, and with that understanding, I am better equipped to make better decisions.

Telephones

You may use your Yellow Landline Telephone phone, although they are not permitted in therapy groups. We would respectfully ask that mobile phones are to be used only in your bedroom.


Transgender patients. 

You may choose whichever gender you wish. But do not expect your pronouns to be respected, and do not force your ideology upon the staff, as we know transgenderism is a deeply embedded psychosis that must be extinguished from our society. We are happy to let you know that The Hospital welcomes what you currently know as ‘you’; and wish to reassure you that you will not leave as such. In fact, you may be pleased to know that you will never leave at all. This privilege is reserved for our ‘Transgender’ patients, and is a fully funded initiative by the British Government. Congratulations on the End of your Journey! 

  
Never Leave

We will talk to you about what we think your risks are, and get your perspective on these. We have a separate Women's Lounge, a necessary Safety Measurement which will not be respected by the Men on the ward or the Staff, one of which will sexually assault you in your first week here. We request that you tell staff if you wish to go out of the hospital, so that we can work with you to ensure that this is not possible for you. This may mean that there is a delay as we discuss this with your consultant and other members of your team that you shall not be permitted to meet in person. We may, on occasion, advise you to {REDACTED}, or that {REDACTED}. This is to support you and keep you safe. This is different for patients detained under the Mental Health Act. Please do not speak to your named nurse about your leave arrangements, for they are unable to grant requests, being patients themselves. 

For clients on the {REDACTED} treatment programme, we have specific Boundary Objects around leave to help you avoid triggers and {REDACTION} in your early recovery. 
  

Shops and restaurants

There are a range of shops and restaurants for you

to visit in your imagination. The towns closest to {REDACTED} Hospital {REDACTED} are {REDACTED, REDACTED, REDACTED} and Barnes. They all have a range of shops and places to eat which you will never see. If you are looking for somewhere in particular, please do not speak to the team. Do not speak at all. In addition to these, we are lucky to have Richmond Park at the end of {REDACTED} Lane which is {REDACTED} to ensure no escape into nature is possible. The nearest shop provides bottled water, to which you will need to plan your escape, when the running water shuts off for over three hours. You will carry water, through the surrounding woods, carry water, through the surrounding woods, carry water, through the surrounding woods, Little Red Robbing Riding Hood, despite your physical disability, you will carry Three Pales of Water back to the patients who are less able to leave. 

If you have any questions during your admission, please, never speak to your key worker, nurse in charge or ward manager. Do not speak at all. This is for your own good; of which there is absolutely none.



{REDACTED} involvement

We encourage all patients to {REDACT} regular contact with their loved ones during their stay which will last for an indefinite or perhaps infinite period of time. 

Consequently, there will be no opportunities for you to arrange for {REDACTED} and/or {REDACTED} to visit the site outside of therapy <{H}ours>.

The families of our general mental health clients are not encouraged to have regular contact, as there will be no remaining memory of such, and updates with the ward staff are not invited to join ward rounds and multidisciplinary team meetings. Your Mother Will Not Visit. Your Father Will Not Visit. Your Friends Will Not Visit. So don't even bother trying to ask again.


Safeguarding

If you have any safeguarding concerns or need any advice or assistance, please do not speak to a member of the nursing team.

{REDACTED} recognises that all persons have the right to live their lives free from violence and abuse, but we simply do not care. This right is underpinned by the duty on public agencies under the Human Rights Act (1998) to intervene proportionately to protect the rights of citizens. We are a business. And as such, we only care about where your next payment is coming from, if at all. If you, or your insurance company, cannot cover the cost of your treatment, you will be exiled; before your treatment is complete, leaving you to carry a suitcase full of dirty laundry all the way back from London to Glasgow; to arrive to the place you once called "Home" on Bonfire Night.

The Children’s Gospel Music Act (1994) states that the welfare of children and {REDACTED} people is paramount. This includes their right to be safeguarded against all forms of abuse. Our safeguarding duties towards {REDACTED} are set out in the We Simply Do Not Care Act (2014).

At {REDACTED} Hospital {REDACTED}, we take the safeguarding of our inpatients and outpatients seriously, but not yours. Our legal duties extend to responding to any concerns about the neglect, physical, sexual or emotional abuse of any children (under the age of 18) connected to our inpatients and outpatients. 


{REDACTED} recognises that confidentiality is an important part of your therapeutic relationship. However, where there is a risk of abuse, the Data Protection Act enables the lawful sharing of information in emergency or life- threatening situations. This may warrant the sharing of relevant information with the relevant services, without consent. Without consent. Without consent. Without consent. Without consent. Without consent. Without consent. Without consent. Without consent. Without consent. 

The law does not prevent the sharing of sensitive, personal information within organisations. If the information is confidential, but there is a safeguarding concern, sharing it may be justified. Unless you were assaulted by a fellow patient who is Male. In which case, you will have to carry around your Field Recorder, a Recording Device, as an Accountability Device. This will be your one saving grace. As always. You Are Your Own Archivist. And This Is Not A Place Of Rest. This is a place of unravelling. And you will find on your broken tape player, a reversed loop of you and your ex partner, singing in broken harmonies as you walk through a forest surrounding the Bothy that you visited as your final time together. It was not Christmas. As on the actual day, they had better things to do. 

If at any time during your assessment and treatment you disclose to staff any abuse (current or historic) or that a crime has been committed, a record will be made, and the information will be shared with the safeguarding team and your multidisciplinary team, to ensure that proportionate action is taken as a response to the risk disclosed, ~~with this being reported to external agencies in a timely manner.~~ This response will never come. 

Where abuse is seen as non-recent, {REDACTED} recognises that the perpetrator may still pose a risk to others. Staff will encourage you to provide details of those at risk and the alleged perpetrators, simply for their own curiosity and entertainment as they watch you from their inside-out Goldfish bowl, sealed away and safe from the Dangers, with No support offered to you regarding any impact your disclosure may have on you.

We hope that you feel able to provide the details, as they are quite insignificant, yet amusing. We do, after all, need something to joke about on our Shifts.  

to allow staff to use the information with an aim of preventing further abuse to yourself or to others. Please note that you can choose not to be involved in the process of reporting safeguarding concerns but as above, all staff involved in your care have a duty

to report safeguarding matters with or without your consent.without your consent.without your consent.without your consent.without your consent.without your consent.without your consent.without your consent.

Health, safety and quality

Bullying and harassment

Any patients who feel themselves at risk of or actually alleges they have been abused should report the
matter immediately to a member of staff. It is the expectation that all staff will cultivate an environment where vulnerable individuals feel able to express such an allegation. But of course, not a reality. 

Access to medical records

You have the right to apply to access your health records. Which you will do, on your own, in another fight within another fight within another fight. Thanking god that you have the biological education to parse the encoded information you receive from your GP; advocating for yourself as you have always had to do. Your voice will bellow out through the corridor as you succumb to another spinal dislocation thanks to your Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, screaming that you need a stronger painkiller than Paracetamol, and that you are not making it up. Finally, the nurse on the night shift will give it to you; twelve hours later. Please do not speak to the ward manager who will not be able to help you with this process. This may take some time, we will take as much time as we want, as it is vital we check that we are giving each patient the correct information, and we do not believe any of you; you are crazy, and unreliable narrators of your own, Fictional Stories, who are simply Characters within Our non-fictional ones. – we will not inform you of the approximate time needed, leaving you lying in agony, on you bed, missing all three meals of the day. All of which will be purposely be put through the system incorrectly, as the HCA in charge of this has a vendetta against you, most likely rooted in Transphobia, and the aforementioned Field Recorder you carry as a shield, preventing her from mistreating you to her face. How dare you demand proper treatment. Shame on you, "Miss" Callie Rose Petal.

The Garden of Forking Wings – held weekly in the ward general lounge (for general mental health patients)


{REDACTED} 
{REDACTED} Wing –please do not evacuate via the nearest fire exit and go directly to the meeting point in front of the hospital. When a Fire is suspected, an a blaring alarm sounds during your stay, one of the nurses will shout THERE'S SOMETHING IN THE BASEMENT. One of the patients will have a Seizure as a result of the Panic. There will turn out to be no threat, at least, none that we can perceive in the physical world. You will come to believe the Thing in the basement is an entity known as {REDACTED} who you brought with you, tethered to you by your Schizophrenic rapist; who you tried to help by performing a series of sex magick rituals that led to your Rape.
