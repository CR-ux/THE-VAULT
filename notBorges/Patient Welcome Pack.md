# Chronography

[^n]: _ The usage of the word “Taxis” within this document does not pertain to the vehicle.[^v] 
[^v]: rather to the concept of Taxis[^t] in biology, which refers to the directed movement of an organism towards or away from a stimulus. Here, it symbolizes the idea of growing downward, drawn by the weight of gravity, afraid of Light.
[^t]: lexDef {Noen|Croen|prodverb} "Taxis" || {A word denoting the metastasis of Life itself, as an expansion of decay, and a contraction of evolution | the collective Noen for the innate Chaos and desire for annihilation contained within the Human Soul, leading to inevitable demise of co-ordinated bodily and cognitive motion n.B.: "an Ataxis of Suicidal Ideation" | Contained within a prodverb of lexicomythography which refers to the Suffering of Desire "The Journey of Taxis Has No Fair"}
[^u]: [['to forgive the characters'. a lexicomythographic prodverb]]
[^TS]: Transgender patients. You may choose whichever gender you wish. But do not expect your pronouns to be respected, and do not force your ideology upon the staff, as we know transgenderism is a deeply embedded psychosis that must be extinguished from our society. We are happy to let you know that The Hospital welcomes what you currently know as ‘you’; and wish to reassure you that you will not leave as such. In fact, you may be pleased to know that you will never leave at all. This privilege is reserved for our ‘Transgender’ patients, and is a fully funded initiative by the British Government. Congratulations on the End of your Journey!
