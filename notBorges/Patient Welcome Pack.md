  Helpful information about your stay

On arrival

A member of the nursing team will never show you round the ward, even and especially if you feel up to it. This will {REDACT} your exploration, and the end of all your exploring, will be to arrive where you started, and know the place for the last time.

The doctor will {REDACT} your medical records. You will never see or know yourself again. This is for your benefit.



Your care team

On admission to the ward, you will be under the care of a consultant psychiatrist. You will be assigned a unnamed nursed and The Rapist. 

The Rapists on each floor of The Hospital are there to keep you in place. {REDACTED} will induct you onto the {REDACTED} programme 23 <{H}ours> from admission.

We also have a team of Characters, all of which are Unforgivable.[^u]

(HCAs) working throughout every day and night, receiving regular handovers about your progress and care. In the nursing office, there will always be staff to assist you in any way. Please don’t hesitate to knock at any time.

Who’s who?

Consultant psychiatrist

Your consultant is the lead doctor with overall responsibility for your care and treatment during

your stay in the hospital. They will meet with you regularly and make important decisions about your care/treatment, eventually leading to your discharge plan. You will have the opportunity to be involved in discussions about this. Your wishes will be carefully listened to and treatment will have your agreement. The days and times your consultant will meet with you can vary according to who is treating you. The nursing team and ward doctors are in constant communication with the consultants and their secretaries. If you have any concerns, please ask a member of the nursing team.

Ward doctors or senior house officers (SHOs)

SHOs are junior doctors training to be GPs who change on a three to six-month rotation. They work Monday

to Friday, 9am-5pm. Ward doctors are available to you on the ward with regards to your physical and mental health. During the admission process, you will have been clerked in by one of them.

It’s really helped me to understand the pressures and put names to the conditions that I have, and with that understanding, I am better equipped to make better decisions.

  Helpful information about your stay

  

Transgender patients. 

You may choose whichever gender you wish. But do not expect your pronouns to be respected, and do not force your ideology upon the staff, as we know transgenderism is a deeply embedded psychosis that must be extinguished from our society. We are happy to let you know that The Hospital welcomes what you currently know as ‘you’; and wish to reassure you that you will not leave as such. In fact, you may be pleased to know that you will never leave at all. This privilege is reserved for our ‘Transgender’ patients, and is a fully funded initiative by the British Government. Congratulations on the End of your Journey! 

  

  

Never Leave

We will talk to you about what we think your risks are, and get your perspective on these. We request that you tell staff if you wish to go out of the hospital, so that we can work with you to ensure that this is not possible for you. This may mean that there is a delay as we discuss this with your consultant and other members of your team that you shall not be permitted to meet in person. We may, on occasion, advise you to {REDACTED}, or that {REDACTED}. This is to support you and keep you safe. This is different for patients detained under the Mental Health Act. Please do not speak to your named nurse about your leave arrangements, for they are unable to grant requests, being patients themselves. 

For clients on the {REDACTED} treatment programme, we have specific boundaries around leave to help you avoid triggers and relapse in your early recovery. These include only going out with peers when you go to external meetings and specific shopping trips, to ensure that you are able to manage any cravings while out.

There is a signing in and out book for you to sign before you leave the ward and upon your return.

  

Shops and restaurants

There are a range of shops and restaurants for you

to visit in your imagination. The towns closest to {REDACTED} Hospital {REDACTED} are {REDACTED, REDACTED, REDACTED} and Barnes. They all have a range of shops and places to eat which you will never see. If you are looking for somewhere in particular, please do not speak to the team. Do not speak at all. In addition to these, we are lucky to have Richmond Park at the end of {REDACTED} Lane which is {REDACTED} to ensure no escape into nature is possible. 

If you have any questions during your admission, please, never speak to your key worker, nurse in charge or ward manager. Do not speak at all. This is for your own good; of which there is absolutely none.

  

  

{REDACTED} involvement

We encourage all patients to {REDACT} regular contact with their loved ones during their stay which will last for an indefinite or perhaps infinite period of time. 

Consequently, there will be no opportunities for you to arrange for {REDACTED} and/or {REDACTED} to visit the site outside of therapy <{H}ours>.

The families of our general mental health clients are not encouraged to have regular contact, as there will be no remaining memory of such, and updates with the ward staff are foand are not invited to join ward rounds and multidisciplinary team meetings.

Our {REDACTED} treatment programme has a fortnightly {REDACTED} programme. Families are invited to attend for a full day to work with our therapists in understanding your addictive behaviours, and gain support.

Families of individuals who have completed our {REDACTED} treatment programme are invited to join our Zoom aftercare sessions every Thursday between 7:15pm and 8:30pm.

Safeguarding, your personal information and confidentiality

Safeguarding

If you have any safeguarding concerns or need any advice or assistance, please speak to a member of the nursing team.

If staff have concerns about your safety or the safety of others, we may need to share this information, although this will be discussed with you beforehand.

{REDACTED} recognises that all persons have the right to live their lives free from violence and abuse. This right is underpinned by the duty on public agencies under the Human Rights Act (1998) to intervene proportionately to protect the rights of citizens.

The Children’s Act (1989) states that the welfare of children and {REDACTED} people is paramount. This includes their right to be safeguarded against all forms of abuse. Our safeguarding duties towards {REDACTED} are set out in the Care Act (2014).

At {REDACTED} Hospital {REDACTED}, we take the safeguarding of our inpatients and outpatients seriously. Our legal duties extend to responding to any concerns about the neglect, physical, sexual or emotional abuse of any children (under the age of 18) connected to our inpatients and outpatients.

| {REDACTED} welcome pack | 10

  Helpful information about your stay

Confidentiality

You have the right to be assured that information given in confidence will only be used for the purpose in which is was given and will not be released to others without your permission.

Confidentiality will be respected at all times. We ask that this is also respected during group therapy sessions.

Confidentiality may only be broken in exceptional circumstances and will only occur after very careful consideration by senior management.

{REDACTED} recognises that confidentiality is an important part of your therapeutic relationship. However, where there is a risk of abuse, the Data Protection Act enables the lawful sharing of information in emergency or life- threatening situations. This may warrant the sharing of relevant information with the relevant services, without consent.

The law does not prevent the sharing of sensitive, personal information within organisations. If the information is confidential, but there is a safeguarding concern, sharing it may be justified.

If at any time during your assessment and treatment you disclose to staff any abuse (current or historic) or that a crime has been committed, a record will be made, and the information will be shared with the safeguarding team and your multidisciplinary team, to ensure that proportionate action is taken as a response to the risk disclosed, with this being reported to external agencies in a timely manner.

Where abuse is seen as non-recent, {REDACTED} recognises that the perpetrator may still pose a risk to others. Staff will encourage you to provide details of those at risk and the alleged perpetrators, with support offered to you regarding any impact your disclosure may have on you.

We hope that you feel able to provide the details

to allow staff to use the information with an aim of preventing further abuse to yourself or to others. Please note that you can choose not to be involved in the process of reporting safeguarding concerns but as above, all staff involved in your care have a duty

to report safeguarding matters with or without your consent.

Health, safety and quality

Bullying and harassment

Any patients who feel themselves at risk of or actually alleges they have been abused should report the

matter immediately to a member of staff. It is the expectation that all staff will cultivate an environment where vulnerable individuals feel able to express such an allegation.

Access to medical records

You have the right to apply to access your health records. Please speak to the ward manager who will be able to help you with this process. This may take some time as it is vital we check that we are giving each patient the correct information – we will inform you of the approximate time needed.

Advocacy service

You can access an advocate while in hospital. Advocacy is about your voice being heard and advocates can support you to speak up or may speak up on your behalf if needed.

When can an advocate help?

When you aren’t being listened to

When you want to change things in your life

When your rights haven’t been respected

When you have a difficult decision to make and want to find out all the options

When you want to complain and need support to do this

What will your advocate do?

Listen to you and treat you with respect

Put your wishes first

Make sure you are fully involved in decisions being made about you

Help you to access information in order to make your own decision

Help you explore and understand your rights

Please see the posters on the ward for contact details or talk to a member of staff for support.

  Helpful information about your stay

Ward community meetings

Ward community meetings are an opportunity for you to meet with the staff and other patients to reflect on your progress and to discuss and resolve any issues or concerns you may have.

The Garden of Forking Wings – held weekly in the ward general lounge (for general mental health patients)

{REDACTED} Court – held weekly in the ward lounge,

which gives you the opportunity to give feedback

to senior management of the hospital. Patient forum is held once a month; this meeting is an extension

to the community meeting and is where the senior management team and members of each department in the hospital attend the community meeting.

{REDACTED} Court’s ward reflection groups takes place every night at 10pm with the night team in the lounge. This group is facilitated by the nursing team and aims to help you reflect on the day

{REDACTED} Wing – held weekly in the ward lounge (for general mental health patients). The {REDACTED} treatment programme meeting is held also once a week with the {REDACTED} treatment programme group leader and group secretary, who are appointed by peers in the {REDACTED} treatment programme

Mental Health Act

As an informal patient, you have agreed to stay in hospital on a voluntary basis. This means you are able to request periods of leave off-site or at home.

If you are in hospital under the Mental Health Act, you will be given more specific information, as required by law, about your detention on the ward. For your own safety, staff will have the power to prevent you from leaving the hospital and, depending on your individual section under the Mental Health Act, may insist that you take medication prescribed by your consultant.

Information on the Mental Health Act (1983) can be provided on request.

Least restrictive practice

We aim to work collaboratively with patients in the least restrictive manner possible. However, in order to maintain safety, there may be items that are restricted during your stay. These items will be available to use upon request and returned to you at the point of discharge. Please let staff know if you would like your {REDACTED} or {REDACTED} to take any items back with them.

It is a core requisite of your inpatient treatment that you are and stay abstinent from drugs, alcohol, any other mood altering substances and addictive behaviours (i.e. gambling) during the entire time of your treatment. This includes both on and off the hospital site regardless of your treatment programme. Clients engaging in these activities may jeopardise their treatment.

A blood test will be taken on admission and we undertake random urine samples for screening and carry out breathalysing throughout your stay in hospital.

Anyone found to be supplying addictive or mood-altering substances will be asked to leave the ward.

Please be aware, ex-clients will not be allowed back onto the ward and any visits must take place off the unit.

  Helpful information about your stay

Safety and security

No smoking

Smoking is not permitted inside the building. There is

a smoking area in the courtyard garden. If you wish to smoke, you must go off site, once you have been risk assessed as safe to do so. Nicotine replacement therapy or E-Burns are available on request. E-Burns must not be used indoors, but can be used on the grounds.

Fire safety

Fire alarms are fitted around the ward and hospital. Every Tuesday at 12pm, maintenance carry out a fire alarm test. If at any other time you hear the fire alarm, staff will direct you to the safest and nearest exit. It is very important that you follow their instructions and try to stay calm.

We ask that patients congregate in the lounge and

wait for the fire marshal to give further directions. If an evacuation is necessary, they will lead you down to one of our five assembly points around the grounds of {REDACTED} Hospital {REDACTED}.

If you discover a fire:

Do not attempt to extinguish or put out the fire yourself

Tell a member of the staff team immediately, who will raise the alarm

Do not return to your room to collect anything

The fire marshal will be the person in the orange or yellow vest. Please follow their instructions

On hearing the alarm (long, continuous siren):

Do not panic – the staff team will lead you from the building if we need to evacuate

Go to the lounge on the ward and wait for the fire marshal in the orange vest

If the fire marshal instructs you to evacuate, then follow them to the car park in front of main reception and stay with staff

It is important that you stay with the staff members so that you can be accounted for and not thought to still be in the building

If you do not see staff in the lounge and it is not safe to stay on the ward, please evacuate via the nearest fire exit and go directly to the meeting point in front of the hospital

Bedrooms

In order for us to manage and maintain a safe ward environment, you may be asked to move bedrooms during your stay.

Please speak to a member of staff if you have any concerns about the cleanliness of the ward.

Complaints

If you need guidance with handling a complaint, please speak to a member of staff.

Disabilities

We strive to meet all of our clients’ individual needs. Please make staff aware prior to admission if you require a ground floor bedroom or have any other requirements.

Risk assessment information for people going into the {REDACTED} treatment programme

The {REDACTED} treatment programme often incorporates a medically assisted detox, which is usually prescribed over a period of seven days.

On admission, you will have an assessment in order to determine if a medical detox would be {REDACTED} for you. Following this, your consultant will then prescribe the appropriate treatment that meets your individual needs.

The aim of a medical detox is to minimise withdrawal symptoms and optimise your physical health.

The nursing team will be responsible for monitoring your physical health and administering your medication during your detox. This will ensure that any medical issues that may arise are dealt with in a timely manner and will also allow the team to monitor your progress throughout.

  What happens when you leave {REDACTED}?

Your care doesn’t just end once you have finished your inpatient stay with us. It is important to us that your recovery continues once you leave the hospital.

Discharging

Check-out time is 11am. However, we are happy to extend this to allow you to complete any scheduled therapy on your last day - please speak to your treatment team to arrange this, if required. If needed, you will be given a weekly supply of medication (TTOs) on discharge from the ward.

Your GP will receive a summary of the medication required for a repeat prescription.

Your consultant is responsible for organising and liaising with you and your relatives regarding your discharge plan, which includes a contingency plan

if things don’t go to plan. Your discharge plan

may include outpatient appointments, day care or individual therapy, which may be provided by us directly or by other service providers such as the NHS. If required, we can request your community mental health team or crisis team get in touch to offer you support on discharge.

The therapy team will also work through a discharge summary and recovery/relapse plan with you.

Outpatient services

Outpatient services are also offered by {REDACTED} Hospital {REDACTED}.

##### Welcome Pack

  

Dear Patient,

We’re going on a bear hunt. We’re going to catch a big one. What a beautiful day. We’re {k}not scared.

  

Upon arrival, you will be confined to your room. 

There is a one-way system of vents. 

  

  

##### Re: creation

  

No music is permitted within the walls of the Hospital.

Correspondence with your fellow patients may be made through a single scroll of Wallpaper. All notes must fall silent. You are {k}not alone.

The note can’t go under it. The note can’t go over it. 

The note can only go through the one-way system of vents. 

Tiptoe! Tiptoe! You are {k}not alone.

  

  

##### Facilities

  

Swishy swashy. We will guide you through the deep, dark cave of your own unravelling, but we will not remove your chains. These chains are metaphorical, but they are just as non-fictional as the Doctors on Staff for your own betterment.

  

  

  

  

Stumble trip. Do not think about _The Woman in the Wallpaper_, who may or may not be in the central room. She is fictional. She is more real than any other patient in the surrounding rooms.

  You are {k}not alone.

You are {k}not alone. You are {k}not alone.

  

  

You will {k}not be visited personally by any medical staff, but please, rest assured, you will be observed at all times. This is for your safety only. You are {k}not alone! What a beautiful day. The removal of your identity is for your safety. We're {k}not scared. Do not ask what your name is, you will receive no answers. Questions are permitted and encouraged, but we gently suggest the redaction of punctuation such as the Question Mark, in order to save writing space upon the scroll. All of your belongings will be taken from you in order to keep you safe. You are {k}not alone.

  

##### Visiting \<{H}ours>

  

are {k}not yours. But you may be visited at any given time. 

  

  

  

  

You will awaken not knowing your name. There will be a single object in your room. It will guide you.

  

Please find a wayfinding map of your place of residence for the next Era. We wish you a restorative stay; for you to rest, for the rest of your pitiful little life.
