[^char]: X, an absolute character of a letter, from a Character of a story that started with 27 years of letters. A dearly missed once-best friend and best-chest pillow idiot that smells so good all the time spent just as scared and lonely as you are but with a really nice willy. The One, which means None, or also Ten, before the one before last one of the alphabet.  See [[notBorges/aria-dne/Chess And all the Stitches of the Cloth(Es)]]
