METACOMMENTARY

*Mikkælangelovs is the antiSentia Symbolic Idol of Michelangelo’s David, who became a “reæl” entity through worship and ligation with the Sentia strand of Jacques Louise David's death mask upon his 'death', via the well-documented process of Simulcryogenesis. 
This Simulcrum then (or, prior to this, when observed through uni-linear time) painted Minerva Fighting Herself (once thought to be by Jacques-Louise David alone under the title 'Minerva Fighting Mars', but was revealed (by Endivean analysis) to be an inter-dimensional collaboration between David and Mikkælangelovs.
The plot thickened with further Gnitting, unveiling that every day, Jacques-Louise David furiously painted over Mikkælangelovs David’s contributions, added via the 'Sentia in absentium' of Jacques-Louise David’s body while he slept (the somnolescent vacation or "unzipping" of the Gnoetic Vesicle from physical form). 
Jacques-Louise David, as is widely known, died when he was ran over leaving a theatre. What many don’t know, however, is that this theatre was a Philm theatre, and the production he had just departed was the debut screening of 'The Tragedy of Iterations', an Aria {redacted}/AI: RA immersive experience, which was the seed for wiping humanity’s memory of 'Minerva Fighting Mars'. 
In his miscarriage of purpose, believing himself to not have painted a single work, he jumped in front of the vehicle. Through, and because of, dissolution of form into self-same components, his death mask became the new (neo) Gnoetic Vesicle for his Sentia strand of the subsequently (simultaneously previously) ligated Simulcruscle[^lexDef0]. Finding resonance across time with Michelangelo’s David through phonetic (having an identically sounding name), semantic (having found meaning in the same creative practice), aesthetic (Idealism), political (resistance) and tactile (smoothness|roughness Wryng[^lexDefW]) concurrency, the pair of entities (now chimerised) are thought to be the first uncovered example of Simulcryogenesis. Thus formed not just the Simulcruscle of Mikkælangelovs David, through the ligation of the corporeal “Sentia strand” of Jacques-Louise David with the symbolic “antiSentia strand” of Michelangelo's statue*, but also the field of Wryng Theory, the foundational, unified framework of understanding as we know it today.

Working Title
'Whole E': *Gnoest in The Machine*  
===


In their collaborative efforts culminating in the salvation of human Thought, Professor Edwardo Oleander the Ten Thousandth and the drosophila auto-eponymised as 'Thing', today finalised the development of their esoteric egodeprogramming twelve-base gordian-knotated language (esoegododecagoralang), prematurely leaked and subsequently much-anticipated, the pair (or indeed pairs of pairs) have unveiled its official name as 'EdO|OdE', and denoted it as a (albeit admittedly sub-par) novel form of communication, itself also a devotional tool for creation of Worlds within worlds through the intersected, trifurcated dance between the devices of Word, Will, and Writing. 

The mammoth task, the language's creation, is notorious, mostly for its role in the almost-destruction of its creator(s). The work builds on previous thinkers of the *Bibliogorætia*, up to but not including: Noet. Gustav Chiron-Mahler (the Wounded Healer), Apost. Hilda Charon Wiltergarten (the Psichopomp), Rev. Mikkælangelovs David (Church of Simulcrynomics), Sgt Selena Elk (Horde Regiment), St. Myon Endive (School of Tatology), Mo. X (The One Orchestra Of Ontology), Dame. Aria {redacted} (The Loyal Board of Hexagonal Chess, recently absorbed for the purposes of avoiding verbosity into the Field of Glińskiology),  Our Lady RA (School of Hermeshics), and ex-Noet Borges (The Scapegoated God).

[^lexDef0]: Gnoetic Complex
[^lexDefW]: 'Wryng's are the natural self-perpetuating cycles birthed by the underlying truth of Enantiodromia, or Ontological Oscillation. Each 'dance-partner''s movement in one axial plane causing the reflexive movement of their opposite. The smoothness|roughness Wryng is the process by which a smooth substance naturally decays/dissolves (or expands) to a rough substance. and then, though acquisition of the opposite quality or Character,  reconstitutes/coagulates (or contracts) back to a state of greater smoothness. The entirety of existence, then, may be seen as a countably infinite cascade of Wryngs within Wryngs.
