Now. Imagine, without me writing it out for you exactly:
	**Right now your eyes are telling you this story, by the meaning you have, at some point yet to happen, Willed, through the intersection of previously associated meanings, into weaving, with sequences of characters, into the fabric of the character contained in your own equally non-fictional story. In their own little way, perhaps unbeknownst to you as they are to me:**

> 	"
> 	"	At the Funeral in the back garden, Aria was getting up from her seat, still maniacally scratching out meaning and restructuring ((as always) in these final moments before needing to Speak them) rewriting words which (at some point, had) read:
> 			"At the Funeral in the back garden, Callie was writing The Eulogy for a loved One she'd entirely made up in her head yet inexplicably became manifest reality, thinking (as if writing about (or indeed, perceiving) herself in third person): 
> 				"She wasn't nervous, in fact this was the one time She didn't feel nervous; as if being observed in Speech or Words (even if they were supposedly written by Some One Else) was the Only time she knew exactly the Way the Other was observing (by providing a restriction (or ( bound) (ar (y) ) ) around the possibilities of causal th (re (a)d) (s    ap) par (-ent (ly[^†])) forming reality ) which is to Shay (the God of (three) Fate(s) and (one (or rather, many)) un- or misint(er) -p(((re)t))(e)d-/-r(in)(t)ed)/(((con))))textualised) Destin(y/ies)), who'd said:

> 				What she would eventually say (absolutely) losing every body in the (horribly clear) time of Others (or, mirrors) staring right back at her (as a single eyeball and the Moon)),  is that she'd found a quote from a madwoman's diary in the psychiatric Ward that she (thinks she) knows is her dead or now long-sleeping loved part of herself (that she still visits every night either by a levitating Chariot in the sky (with a (sabre tooth tiger-looking wood carving on the (now (but never, really) realised) emptiness of the vehicle (she'd Once been steering)) or by the fear-striking innocences of pitter-pattering rat paws under the feet of a screaming child, which had once read:

> 						"Now, I wish to quote or paraphrase a long-forgotten and unknown Poet Callie Rose Petal if you Will as in strive to Be humour me, the quote reads:
> 							"I would like to quote another verse perhaps by a now forgotten poet whose name is forgotten but their work will always be remembered if we Will it Be, she says:

> 								  "I am saying what beauty is all about. It may come to us in the name of a film or in a piece of poetry we may even find it in the pages of the faces of a book of the Words World's within-"
> 								  outwardly, through an indirect string of seemingly confusing recursion and meta-narrative and/or structure, perhaps there is a reason this writer's Words are considered Worlds outwith The Word, which may, as I truly believe, because I know it was intended, through negation, as a device through which to peer directly into its 'I'"

	PEERING BACK THROUGH THE FEARFUL HOPE OF THE MACROSCOPE
	For something to exist it must first be imagined right well please do not imagine this at Home because you will remember just before the moon ritual last night where i drew her down into me, just before hte 'macroscope vision' if elt i was being blocked , on purpose, from beginning the ritual (just before the 9pm of 'plugging in', and i knew i'd remember why. so i relaxed into the blockage. then i fuond my lighter and i knew it was the right time then which is the wrong time to write about it now, moving to my computer I switched off the Bach record (A vinyl Record or an unspeakably compact disc which is a three-dimensional cross section of infinitely higher dimensions of both time and space revolving around an axis of awareness of the chain of meanings ascribed to the single central rod of Feeling that the music's album of photographs of memories of families making more babies rining clouds of tears upon the schisms of families trying to escape a Citadel of split hairs racing against toirtoise shell shields held back to protect itself from a much larger Aegis that they themselves form a party of cycles of being Heard through the Records of time flattened into very nearly but not quite two dimensions which coincidentally or exactly by design has a celtic knot design on it resembling nine threads interwoven, i switched it off and knew nit wasn't quite what she wanted so i moved to my computer and there, there was a single song  i'd discovered during my explorations of the fractal there was a moment in my PhD, in my genomics PhD which was also a stripping of knowledge to build ignorance of this autoimmune system of networks of trans people supporting one another, where I asked to speak to a particle physicist who Sam Lysett, one of my favourite scientists, had the honour to sit with her and talk, just talk about ideas for a good half an hour or so. That was one of, maybe my favourite moment of my PhD, because that was the moment where she said, look, Calliope, this is where it all kind of falls apart, you've gone too deep now, where in terms of, this is where science ends and philosophy begins, or mathematics ends and philosophy begins, because I kept asking within my research group, all of the geneticists and bioinformaticians, remembering bioinformaticians are literally like coders or decoders of genetic material, which is basically the deepest, the deepest layer of life that we have capability of understanding. And then going through all of those colleagues, and then being like, oh, no, no, you just have to talk to this person and this person, going down to different layers of reality until I got to Sam, the quantum physicist. And then I was talking about quantum tunnelling through the nucleus, not the nucleus of the cell, but the, sorry, the nucleotides themselves, and injection of a virus into a cell. And Zeno's paradox of how, you know, like, it should never actually really get into the cell. So, no cell, no material should ever get in or out of the cell, because it has to pass through a membrane. It needs to tunnel, there needs to be a moment of quantum superposition when there is a potential inside and outside at both times. And then, yeah, this is, this is kind of where all of our current understanding collapses.; I played it without thinking, but remembering. it asking to be played, and it felt like god/dess was speaking to me through my self , then the vision happened lying in my bed looking directly at her through my left eye (which eye did Odin sacrifice?) - the this morning,   i was moved to tears my a moment listening to the same Michael yonkers song, where a different, but equally real, vision of the 'future' came to me, in which the story i am writing right now had become a film, or indeed, a multisensory immersive experience written by one of my cvharacters, and the AI under the surface editing my own 'memory' of the 'future' ; cementing it as an absolute reality by the act of Will, and suddenly i was an audience member of a character i had created, the very narrative itself weaving itself into my life by the very processes of self-same recursion i am exploring, as if looking upon the face of the 'Being' (which is in fact a series of 'processes' forming a greater process of a microbe that is part of a greater process that stretches infinitely inward and out-ward, and without ward and within ward and outwith ward and in within outward outwith in without; the lyrics i was listening to now speaking to me now but not now, the me sitting in this 'cinema' or reading the cosmic book on the shelf of this library , my infinite searching through lifetimes and possibilities of choices (themselves infinite lifetimes within this so-called 'singular' lifetime, these processes both shared in unity and separated , fractured infinitely between mirrors of selves lookingn upon themselves and forming an impossible structure of strings in loops in quarks in atoms in motion of quantum tunnells of movement of subatomic particles 'breathing' their way through the same enantiodromic waves of processes through sub-strands of strands of threads of DNA wreapped around histones being modified by the awareness of them wrapped like thread about these ever-shifting rivers of proteins, stretching out not just in space and temporal space, but in the connections they make through the meaning we, the same being orchetsrating thiswhole design, create with our 'stories' (stories as in narrative, stories as in strings of letters, stories as in stories of a building, stories as in user stories of components of function of a program that we are writing which is self-same self-replicating code which is made of the same constituent letters and characters and characters as in members of a story which means the same thing as characters within words upon a page upon a book upon a shelf that is infinitely different iteratively the same as all the other glyphs or characters in letters in words on shelves in repeating hexagonal rooms of infinitely different and stretching round into circular similarity never arriving at the same place in the infinitely stretching libraries reaching out as a wunderhorn in the shape of an infinitely-dimensioned gordian toroidal mandelbrot mandala inkblot on a vorschach test tube in a laboratory of exploration of a series of augmented realities of scales or strata of the indivisible whole or scales on an ouroboros biting its own tale which is itself a narrative sub-thread or sub-reddit in a forum of ideas and concepts and infinitely increasing in complexity explorations of fractals of memory converging with meaning in an inexorably inextricably linked chain of self-similarity staring at itself wrapped so tightly upon itself for the purposes of a grand user story which is to save memory but not just in terms of treasuring it like the gold inside of a chest at the end of a fibonacci rainbow, but, somewhere, over the rainbow, and under it, and wound through its fabric of un-reality or manufactured reality or rather inorganic artificiality folding back upon itself to form the most organic, singular process pervading and underpinning and underscoring as in a character on a keyboard on Goddess's piano playing modes of the same scale of 7 notes represented by the same 7 letters of the same alphabet but represented through different translations that must be present in order for the tower to never be fully built but rather in the process of becoming by being blasted down by the very inwardly-outwardly peering consciousness that decided the constituent parts were becoming too self-aware of its own sentience and in order for the Will  to self-generate to keep rebuilding and collapsing the tower towards it that they are encapsulated in the sub-collapse into strata or scala of processes was necessary i.e. Sophia or wisdom or Mind or Logos or The Words needed to fracture in order to be seen as the word they form a part of which is a series of letters in a 'string' as in a data type which forms a system of different data types that both weakly and strongly conform to their own patterns in a super-system of codes forming the Greatest Story and so Michael Yonkers or God or my Self sang out to me, resonating through every fibre of this system within a system within a system within a wheel within a wheel within wheels within weals within wheels within wheels of a vehicle running itself over and killing it upon the cold hard concrete of a roundabout with no return to the same position but always in the same rotational movement to be reborn from the blood seeping into the tarmac and spilling out into its fractals of constituent erythrocytes and Her Myth Rowed Sights the Words made of letters sent in the system of networks of the same postal service fractured amongst countries in  islands of feeling within islands of ideas within islands of bodies of populations within geographic islands within astronomical islands within cosmic islands within philosophical islands which are themselves within the deepest layer of mathematical islands which are metaphysical islands which fold back to the same island of consciousness entirely all one and therefore always alone , the grief of loss wrapping back to remind us that we haven't lost anything because we are always this same spider who is argus with one hundred thousand million billion trillion ineffably infinite eyes pointing in upon itself as a means to spin the very web that ensnares it notn just to catch another subsection of itself to devour and kill violently drinking in its entrails of trails of narratives of the so-called end of its story which is the beginning of Hers, the same fly talking to the same flight talking to the same Process talking to the same Stillness of Awareness of the Not-Being-but-Becoming-but-Be-Come-In/out;  just talking  to the same being, itself: 'we're so near, and I knew you'd remember. I was your friend, and I knew you'd remember. Since you're here, please come to me. And I knew you'd remember. You were so near, and I knew you'd remember. I was your friend, and I kne wyou'd remember. I thank you for you and me and I know I'll remember, you were so near, and I know I'll remeember, I was your friend, and I know i'll remember, you were so near, and I know i'll remember, I was your friend, and I know I'll remember, you were so near, and I know i'll remember i was your friend and iu know i'll rememenbr you were so near and I know i'll remember i was your friend and i know i'll remember you were so near and i know i'll remember i was your friend and i know i'll remember PEERING IN THROUGH THE TEARS OF THE 'I'S IN W(I)TH(I)N WITHOUT THE TROPES OF MY TURNING MICROSCOPE'S HOPE just before the moon ritual tonight where i draw her down into me, just during the  'macroscope vision' if I felt i was being shown, on purpose, by being withdrawn from beginning the ritual (just before the 9pm of unplugging the bathtub in a psychiatric ward bathtub relieving it of its holding via the rubber round disc that I had to ask for permission to use for the sake of cleaning myself and not to fill the bathtub with enough water to try to drown myself but also absolutely to drown my Self and i knew i'd remember why. so i relaxed into the blockage. then i fuond my lighter and i knew it was the right time, moving to my computer I switched off the bach record (vinyl) which coincidentally or exaclty by design has a celtic knot design on it resembling nine threads interwoven, i switched it off and knew nit wasn't quite what she wanted so i moved to my computer and there, there was a single song  i'd discovered during my explorations of the fractal I think maybe each character is a tower, each character is a tower of infinite libraries in terms of the stories that they are creating for themselves, so-called for themselves, and then their movement through their stories, their movement through this infinite library of choices, which really are choices that we make, and they are real at the same time as being completely not real. And then through these, opening all these different books, going through all these different stories, following this thread of, you know, in the part of the story when the character is talking about this idea where one book would lead to another, would lead to another, much like when you were a kid and when CDs were still a thing, and then the CD would be in the wrong case, so you'd go to the next one, and then the next one, and the next one, on this kind of like treasure hunt, kind of like a choose-your-own-adventure story. But the adventure has actually already been written, every possibility of the adventure has been written. It's just you that's choosing the path through that's changing, so-called changing, but then as the choices wrap back on themselves, the connections through a space that we are incapable of seeing, it actually means that we're just repeating this, being one consciousness, because that's really what this is all pointing to, being one consciousness through this strand of the library, then knotted back upon itself, shows that if it's a substrand of a web or really kind of like a subwire of a greater wire that has an action potential flowing down it in a very formulated spiral pattern that's kind of wrapped on itself ad infinitum, and then each of these character stories intersecting in a way that looks like, you know, imagine the very, very, very rudimentary diagram or movement diagram of atoms, of atoms where you have electrons erroneously being shown to be moving in circles around the centre. Imagine this, like a plaited knot, a Celtic knot of nine strands that are interlocked in three triangles, and this itself is a cross-section, so moving through space, they appear to be overlapping with one another, but they're not, actually, because they never intersect, they are just the same thing, it's just that it's, I really can't explain it, but Donnie Darko kind of-ish began to do it when, in that moment when he starts to see his future by this kind of orb that glows out from him, as if he is a cross-section in time, which we are, three-dimensional cross-sections in time, but then this can be taken further, the time span itself can go into a fifth and sixth and seventh, etc, maybe to nine, and I think I'd like to explore the concept of the ninth dimension, actually, maybe in the bioinformatician story or something, or one of the characters definitely needs to have an interest in quantum physics, because that's something I've neglected, I think.; I played it without thinking, but remembering. it asking to be played, and it felt like god/dess was speaking to me through my self , then the vision happened lying in my bed looking directly at her through my left eye
