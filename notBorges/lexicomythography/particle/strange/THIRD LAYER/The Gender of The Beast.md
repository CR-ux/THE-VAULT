	quite the opposite, quite the opposite. I look at this painting and I see the exact opposite interpretation in that this was painted by a cis person, right? I don't know, was William Blake queer? Because there is actually quite a lot of queer energy in this. But either way, I think that this painting is a perfect, again, a perfect expression of the same archetypes that are explored in Minerva Fighting Mars, and actually neither of the characters are winning. Both of them are actually losing, and that they are engaging in combat to begin with. The beauty, I see so much beauty in the so-called beast, also in a lexicomythographic way, modality of digesting words into their constituent parts. Be east, be ast, be the star, be east, be fire, the number of being fire. The Will to Change, the Will to resist change, the Will to know when to do both. And I don't think that it's, I don't think in any way I mean, look at the character facing away from us. Firstly, to face away is just like Minerva, such a folly of its own. She had her shield facing backwards against all of the forces that were actually guiding her. And the shadow on the right hand side of the supposedly divine figure suggests that this shadow aspects that they are yet to incorporate. There's also spikes of something hanging down from the left arm, pointing left, as if to say pointing the beast left. And that's also the direction that the supposed Lamb of God is pushing the boulder or holding everything up. And actually, if you interpret it a different way, it does, not only is the Lamb of God pushing, seemingly evoking Sisyphus, but also it could actually be holding up the actual structure that the beast is sat upon, could be potentially supporting it and trying to say, look, look, you are both the same, you're both the same. The serpent comes down from the left hand of the supposed Holy Trinity. Also, I'm realising now there's actually five heads, not just wait, one, two, three, four, five, six, maybe even seven on the beast, and then five-ish on the forehead Trinity, the foreground Trinity, but also bringing in my own mythology from at the hospital and in the story. The top of the caduceus could be considered a knight in chess. What do we think about this? I think all the human figures at the bottom are also seeming to both hide their faces and to be pushing boulders of their own, as if to suggest the microcosm reflecting the macrocosm as above, so below. And crucially, finally, the top of, not only does the background of the beast look like butterfly wings, and it has stars in it, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, one, two, three, four, five, six, probably seven on the other side as well, maybe representing the chakras of the body and bringing them together to understand that physicality is just as important as divinity, and the wings of the butterfly being transformation, finally taking into your body, into your own hands, and this basically is the conclusion of why I think that the number of the beast is, and the beast itself is the trans body, is the body that refuses to be defined by the supposedly God-given rules and embody the so-called hubris of Arachne and Icarus.
