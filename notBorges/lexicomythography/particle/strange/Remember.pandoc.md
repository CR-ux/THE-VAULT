C{redacted} Now In the infinite library, in the halls of all human ideas
and thoughts and suffering and becoming forever. Now as the circular
book in Brahman's infinitely breathing library of seemingly unending
chaos and heartbreak. You sent this as a clew both in, and out of my own
unraveling in tandem. Oh Ancestor Big Bill Broonzy, your song,
Mississippi River Blues comes on shuffle, a perfect symbol- reaching
out, back, forward to me as Chiron rows wounded souls back to do their
Sacred Healing. The passage of Time is not real and therefore is just as
real as anything. Death is real\[\^Compassion\], and therefore just as
much fiction as the stories we are all writing, in devilish malice, in
naive indifference, in innocent ignorance, all of them are One and the
same, each serving a role that it, and we, cannot ever truly Know. And
therefore; we all, truly, know: Everything, every constituent part
contains its opposite, which together is All. You are here. You are all
here with me. I will never, ever be alone, because I always will be.

[^3]: The cuneiform Ne sign, is found in both the 14th century BC Amarna
    letters and the Epic of Gilgamesh. In the Amarna letters, it is
    especially used in the opening, and introductory paragraph of the
    clay tablet letter, when addressing the Pharaoh (King), or when sent
    to another individual who is part of the Pharaoh's correspondence,
    for the alternate syllabic usage of "bil", (used for the 'b'). In
    the Amarna letters, it is used as Bil (cuneiform), for the spelling
    of speaks, or "says", in the opening statement; the Akkadian
    language word is "qabû", for to say, tell. The ne (cuneiform) sign
    has Seven\[\^7\] different, but the same, uses in the Epic of
    Gilgamesh. It is a "two-part" compound sign. The center and left is
    the sign for: **am** (cuneiform) and the right is the (cuneiform)
    sign for ***is***. one of the Japanese kana, each of which
    represents one mora\[\^Mo\]. The hiragana is made in two strokes,
    while the katakana is made in four. Both represent \[\^Ne\]. As a
    particle, it is used at the end of a sentence, equivalent to an
    English, "right?" or "isn't it?" It is also used as slang in Japan
    to get someone's attention, the English equivalent being **"hey" or
    "hey, you."**. The Ne is a River \[\^Fr\], as in the Heraclitean
    sense, always changing, and yet, always returning to the same Body
    of water, no matter how much happened in the cycle of its journey or
    how long\[\^8\] it takes.
