**BOUSTROPHILOLOGY: The Birth of lexDefs**
---
Boustrophilology is the 'Devouring Mother' of our Society, the 'conceptual dissolution machinery' of the various Fields of Lexicomythography.
At its core, it describes a process of breaking down a character (glyph | letter | broken unit of communication), character (broken | unbroken personage), character (quality), word (unbroken string of characters | unit of communication), word (promise, broken or unbroken), sentence (string of words), sentence (punishment), book (broken unit of a story | unbroken whole of a story), story (a woven lie, or broken promise | an unbroken unit of truth in an infinite chain of narrative | a broken unit of user functionality in a piece of software | an unbroken, whole narrative of books), or even an entirely confusing 'antiLiterary cluster' of intersecting, nested meta-narratives veiled as a series of pseudoAcademic papers {perhaps presented in a novel format (such as a GnitHub repository)}. 


**Boustrophedon Trans Form (BTF)**
---
BTF is an Lexicomythogralchemical method of Meaning Decomposition and Morphological Coagulation, in which a sentiment input (i) is iterated through a fractal of outputs (o), to create a *mis en abyme* of 'i|o's, resulting in novel meaning, or rather, unveiling archaic memory embedded within a sentiment. 


**Th{reads}**
There are (usually) two 'strands' of a BTF 'block', but historically, there have been many, many more. In ERA {REDACTED}, one particular BTF operation (we prefer not to disclose for safety purposes) resulted in the collapse of a sub-civilisation. And so, as alluded to in the final words of the anteAntiquarian Quantum Sculptor *CARPVS MORTVVM*[^‚Ä†], we follow the standard reference range of Two Lines. 



**The Under-Word Opera
---
There are Four Operonds | Operotas (plura, Opera) of BTF.
These Opera are denoted the following correspondence, in order of occurrence:

|       | OPEROND | OPEROTA |
| ----- | ------- | ------- |
| IGNIS | G       | üúÇ      |
| TERRA | T       | üúÉ      |
| AQVA  | C       | üúÑ      |
| AER   | A       | üúÅ      |

*Table 1: The Eight **Opera***

**Operonds**
---

In their Operond form, these cardinal components are the objects that are operated on, i.e. the 'Numbers' of each lexiQuation (line of operation), each corresponding to a nucleotide component in a Gnoegenomic sequence, :
- G - the 'Fuel'
- T - the 'Foundation'
- C - the 'Feeling'
- A- the 'Soul'
These four (FFFS), as you will notice, form 'complementary base pairs'; so that each Operond is 'bonded' to its pair on the line following:

G  T
 |    |
C  A


Operota
---

In their Operota form, these Four are the Lexicomythematical 'processes' involved in the lexiQuations:

- üúÇ - Destructive Transformation: Division (/) and Subtraction (-)
- üúÉ - Grounding Coagulation: Multiplication (x) and Addition (+)
- üúÑ - Constructive Transformation: Exponents<sup>e</sup> 
- üúÅ - Communicative Dissolution: (Brackets)




Worked Example
---

For example, take the word 'Character':

CHARACTER

In the 'First-Pass' of BTF, the *Sentia* input (i) is dissolved, in a 3'-5' directive (left to right), into constituent components of somatic (phonetic | graphemic), semantic (etymological | , or symbolic meaning, depending on the **Compol<sup>C</sup>** utilised.

CHAR || {ACT | OR || ER }



In the 'Second-Pass', the output (o) of the First-Pass is processed in a 'reverse' (5'-3', right to left) manner. 




**<sup>C</sup>Compolymerases**


|                       | Compolymerase I | Compolymerase II | Compolymerase III |
| --------------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| output components (o) | Somatic Units   | Semantic Units   | Symbolic Units    |
