{INITIATE TRANSCRIPTION}
{START: SIGHT}


My brain wrote exactly around one thousand words, or approximately two years and seven months, of this text while I was half-dreaming this morning, just a couple of minutes ago. 

In the dream, it was really beautifully written, so I’m sorry[^sorry] about that. And how it’s just {k{not}} coming out the same as I empty my bowels upon waking. 

In the dream, that wasn’t the writing of it but rather the “events” which occurred in order to write about them; there was a {thick|black|dark} {lake|loc{h/k}|{qua|{ke{y}}}, that was once just horrendously cold enough to *dare* me to jump in and swim inside it. But I was simply looking at how ill it would make me now. 

They pulled a gigantic hippopotamus out of the lake - but it wasn’t gigantic in form, it was a {scrawny|mangy} little thing - it was {in{stead}} gargantuan {in {the wa{y|ves}}} of a symbol: how it {holds down|squeezes|crushes} letters, like a paperweight on an ugly glass table, that makes an {ugly|scraping} sound, before {sliding off the table|{{breaking you}r big toe}}. It was prehistoric and terrifying, and a cruel man had designated himself its handler; pulling a {sodden|grime-soaked} rope, {slimy with seaweed, wrapped|rapt} around the poor thing's skeletal jaw as it snapped {open|closed}. Mechanically, like the jaws of a machine {or the strangle of a Lover} {r|d}esigned to extract nea{{t(,)|r}(l)y}-d(r)ying bodies from {Be(r)tran(d')s {Net | B | } {The r}ubble. 

Anyway, my brain started to exist on two, directly opposed and perfectly complementary {(p){l(a\[i]nes)}
