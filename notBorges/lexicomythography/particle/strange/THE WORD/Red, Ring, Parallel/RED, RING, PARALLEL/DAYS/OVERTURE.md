Noam doesn’t want to think about what led him to this Hospital.

Nima feels in her unknowing that she has been lead, here to red-hot smelting Gold for a reason.

He knows he needs to write this book while he is here.

She doesn’t know how, but she has a feeling, as always, it is through The Word.

He knows he will either finish it,

She stopped trying to reason with endings a long time ago.

or it will finish him.

When her life truly began.

His protagonist is a woman, which surprised him

She is being called to the archetypal masculine she has long had to suppress for her own survival, her own sense of Becoming, which, as what we palliate that which we cannot cure, has counter-pointed her unravelling.

His work is coming out of him inexplicably lately, as if not his own

Her Words were never hers, or at least now she realises, in her silent contemplation.

The Word has always been his crucible, The Word is what’s listening when nobody else will

She feels the rhythm of the World in the silence of the trees.

Growing up, socialized female, nobody listened to him

Shrinking down back to childhood, socialized male, nobody saw her.

Even now, as a fully passing man, assimilated into this patriarchal cis heteronormative society,

  
But now, as a trans woman, with all its reed-basketed visibility, read through media, through the inherent inter-netted irreversibility of Testosterone’s effects on the physical body and the Body of people so bent upon and by the empirical,

Nobody _hears_ him

Still, no Body sees her.

He was foolish enough at one point to hope, to pray, to beg whatever forces bestowed upon him a body made to be broken, a body made to be misunderstood, that the change of pitch in his voice, from the thickening of his vocal cords thanks to the Testosterone he waited in a 6-year queue to gain access to, would be enough amplification, would fit into the right frequency range, to be listened to, but much, much more importantly, to be heard.

Being heard, he thinks, is a human right.

Being seen less so.

The eye has a way of playing tricks

But the ear,

The ear knows something unseeable.

Because to not be heard is to be forgotten by God.

i.                                Anger is a healthy response to boundaries being crossed.

And Noam is angry.

He knows his anger must continue to be stifled.

In resonant ringing stinging parallel to his pre-transition, closeted state, his anger needs to be muted

Because the justified state of anger in trans people, whose boundaries, raining fire - still essentially non-existent in this world, is the only amplified aspect of their experience

ii.                              Sadness is a healthy response to disconnection

But Noam is not sad. Not anymore.

Through disconnection to Others, through being Othered  by disconnection

He has been wrongly told his whole life that connection to others will bring him happiness.

But it is this rampant, exhausting reaching, trying desperately to connect to a world bent on severing every empathetic thread –

Has caused the deepest disconnection a human being can feel:

Disconnection from One Self.

So here, in hospital, being encouraged (as the tapping of a crow’s feet in imitation of the rain may encourage the rising of a worm to its own demise) to attend group therapy -

Attempting to ‘engage’ with the incomprehensively incompatible views, prejudices and ignorance of Others so twisted in their revolutions about the endless smothering spool of Othering him:

This is a greater disconnection than any time spent alone writing his book.

He has forgotten his values, contorted himself into shapes demanded by hands with no intent of compassion. Only harm.

He is remembering

He is remembering that when One is disconnected to the Outside

The only way through, is In –

And in

We

Go

_this is my therapy. I don't care what anyone says. I will attend my 1:1s. I will take my medication. I will not engage with the other people here. I refuse to let my energy and power be taken from me anymore. I know my own body. My own heart. This is my therapy. If they won't let me play the piano, so be it. I will build a universe._

_In The Tarot, The Devil (the XVth card) is often cited as representing temptation, attachment to ego, and the chains of desire which perpetuate our Sisyphean suffering. I feel a somewhat more nuanced relationship to this card. Particularly as a trans woman. The Devil is my favourite card in the deck, for a multitude of reasons._

_Memory and Meaning are two intertwined serpents, winding in tandem about a central rod of Suffering. This rod goes by other names. Desire. The Devil. Enlightenment. God. Whatever you wish to call it, it resides in your spine, and if you are Now enough, you may be able to venture deeply into this space and observe its nature – both an immovable object, and an unstoppable force._

_Memory and meaning wrap about this central axis, and each of their intersections can be seen as an ‘event’. These intersections, or ‘events’ also have many names and countless faces. People. Places. Things. All are edgeless, endless occasions of Becoming, fixed in the shimmering amber of these intersections, which we perceive as “memory of Object A, the meaning I associated with it”_

_The Desire (and therefore Suffering) leading to an intersection can be seen as the segment of the central rod unbound by serpents; and the distance between the serpents at any given point on the vertical axis is correlated to our perception of Time._

_The more Meaning strays from Memory, the longer Time is perceived as passing._

_The closer Memory and Meaning converge, the faster we perceive the passing of Time._

_Because Time is not real, it is simply our felt sense of the distance between Memory and Meaning._

_The Suffering, and Desire, leading from an event / occasion / person / place and its cognate memory, can be observed as the segment of exposed rod directly above the intersection in question._

_Suffering, Desire, When stripped to the Core of the Fruit of their essence, to the Vertical Seed stemming through the centre of everything_

_May also be called Now_

_Or,_

_I Am –_

_Otherwise known as Awareness_

_Or, as some might know Her,_

_God._

**Arbor is Climbed by Snake**

snake, beneath Umbra, climbs Arbor , reaching ever towards Sky , never getting there but also, the sky itself is surrounded by an endlessly bigger snake that is also the same as the snake initially mentioned , the snake doesn’t know this , the snake is told she is the devil, the snake just wants to tell Eve the truth - that there is Evil all around her, that there is danger everywhere, that the fruit  to be eaten is breaking of a fast - waking up. Waking up to the Stars in the sky. The Sun’s rays, but the stars rays, the stars the stars blocked by the sun , need dark need dark, need dark to see them
