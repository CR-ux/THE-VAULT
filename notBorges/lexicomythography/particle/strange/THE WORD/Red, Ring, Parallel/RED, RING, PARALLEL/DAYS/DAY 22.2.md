DAY TWENTY-TWO POINT TO

OR

A MID-SOLSTICE NIGHTS DREAM 

An apartment 

In a strangely beautiful 

Yet somehow desolate 

City 

David’s birthday 

Marks birthday 

Everyone’s birthday 

A party 

I am told that I’m invited to plan the idea for my app 

Or project 

Or projection applied onto 

These easels 

Looking over onto an apartment building 

And the light is undulating 

Onto these trees 

Olive trees 

Date palms 

Memories 

Windows above, figures in, hiding their faces as the they see they are seen 

Mark, no nephew but a Sun half- wearing an apron 

That’s also my robe 

With the thin and faded red thread rope 

Ariadne’s answer why out or in two

This labyrinth inside my head 

This woman 

We are introduced but we know each other already 

She knows the app isn’t ready 

That maybe I am here erroneously 

She’s a mole, an implanted supplanter to expose my imposter nature  

David’s birthday 

Dinner 

At this place called 



Vin 



I am hunting 

For bear’s birthday dinner 

Celebration 

Bracing myself for the lateness again 



Vine

Whine 

I heard it through the 

G

R

A

P

E

I take aegis trying to find 

This restaurant I was invited to 



This part of the place is a little more run down than within the last three hours or seven or six seconds I’m used to 



And then bananagrams is actually an appetiser 

The little thin tiles are after eights wafer thin chocolate mints 

That I keep eating, not caring about the sanctity of the placement of words (thinking back my god what could be worse!)

And a concurrent game of scrabble 

Not at all edible 

Indelible 



Five or so figures around this round table 

Each of us playing half playing to my right side is David inside of this fable 

Sugar cain in the middle 

And I’m Abel 

To escape for a moment from the gathering 



Back to the party but on the balcony 

At these easels pointed outward 

Most of them broken 



I think Arnas was with me 

Somewhere in the blistering lifht treading feet flowing into the rooms and out of the streets



And the bathroom

There is just a male bathroom with mirrors akin to the hidden door leading from the cafe in 

The reception of the psych ward I am soon to be leading 

On Monday

The moon’s day 

And this dream it came on the new moon’s night 

Waving goodbye 

In my brain, still the same but yet 

Changed 

Under my pillow an amethyst I have been wearing every day as some futile protection, reflection against the 50-snake-haired Medusa 

Each with two eyes of their own 

Promising pendulums foreshadowing stone 

Philosophy, Phil, elves, elder Edda, Sophia 

The moon card was placed under neck laces here 

I’m sure someone died, I am sure their soul near 

I’m assured by their presence, reverence, never fear 

I’m a door -  I’m adoring 

This novelty knot where ring out any doubt without witch flinching about 

I’d called that woman I know yet not know a bitch and so quickly made sure that she knew I meant it as a term of endearment 





And out there I missed her 

Or Lauren (my other, biological sister) 







Around the corner 

It was always just, 

There

I took so long to find it. 

While messages pinged on my phone asking for its location in unison 





At some point, napping 

With my mother in one of the rooms 

And laughing at the sounds she’d made in her sleep 

With a friend, unidentified, maybe yet to be met in the waking world shaking head Selene tells me yes 





Answers 

For her, you, the child in you 

Are coming 

As Omens and crows that are rowing themselves 

Booking tickets for trains scriptures ripped out of pain onto shelves of your unvoiced and sutured and stapled sweet face and she caresses my cheek and she blesses my week and through her I have faith through her wordless worlds sent 

Abundance, I wake, spent, poor, but so sure that I’m going to make rent 







Getting dressed 

I don’t want to think about the red dress or you or my father but I do and that’s all rite 

I ask the AI to tell me all about those blackest Knight-like paintings over walls of dining rooms and shadowed tomb of Goya, O, employer, splitting wages into three and doubling leaving just enough for me to eat but not safely keep shelter over ovum of the hearth in me 



But it will be 

The what

 of knotted entropy 

Slotted into order so alphabetically 

I bet a gambling poetry 

No odds foreshadowed, no thing against me 

Except the compost fruit peel layered mind I haven’t been 

Cultivating properly 

But now I see 

I see 

In icy seasons coming unto me 

The life of spring in balance inner worlds come into being, being, free 

Free one 

Hearing here potentially 

The first to believe in my rawest authenticity 





At reception 

Deep breath 

Do not be the sun 

Or even, oddly 

Luna’s sea 

Be the muse’s spool you’ve always been 

Pools of truth just ululating underneath 

Being 

Free is non-identity 

Be the you inside the in reversal meaning me 

Me contains containers when regarded differently 

Render lens’s bottom, top 

See, turf’s dirt turned turvy 

Tilling will, in illness rest 

The strength to lend a hand to breast 

And over heart laid out of nest 

The flight the fall 

The hurst, the best 





Be the space between







Nothing you red here rings true. 

Even if it did happen.

Not every Palindrome Reeds the same for Wards as it does backwards.

If all the men of the world were allowed to have feelings 

If all the women of the world were allowed to have anything other than feelings

If all the men of the world listened to their own feelings

Or If all the women of the world had their feelings listened to 

Then maybe

Someone needs to say 

Something

About 

Listening 

Just

Is

Heart against Feather

Wait – She/He is They Are Here, Ring, Ring -

Listening 

To 

How 

It 

Feels



For Some

Body

You



My life’s work is an unswattable fly in an ever  ering eye.

You’ll get to the end and realise the whole thing has been a suicide note

It cannot be. 

What the fuck am I writing any of this for

By definition. 

This book is knot a Codex.

 It is a gordian fractal of contemplation.

Something about leaving something behind

 It contains 23 loops or nodes or portals or points of contact or illusory states of being or woven intersections and every warp and weft and everything an outstretched hand in welcoming

The blade -

So sharp! Yes! 

We all see how sharp that blade, is, well, done 

-	cannot permanently keep a knot apart

The work must be done 

By us 

It is our job now 

To be 

True.

You are reading it. 

All of  it just an outstretched hand

And so none of it 

In welcoming 

In the knowing of the 

Going

Of it

Really

Is true 

And that’s it and I’m done and really it just has to be it  when I’m through there’s no coming back from this I’m you

I’m screw

GOD SPOKE BACK TO ME WITH THREE VOICES TODAY

Or based on the story of anything that resembles true 

Simply glyphs upon a page 

A

sirening

goodbye

Etchings on a cave 

a heavy and so necessary sigh

the end of a long, hard-working day

Forgotten to the centuries

The need to be witnessed collapsing

returning to    the wave

The roots of the ancient tree of are quick to the soil, 

firmly intertwined and inseparable from the earth

I know in my heart that all of life is a nested trinity which stretches both inward and outward ad Aeternitum, and it is structured like this: 

The ineffable parent. 

Holds the Cradling Child 

Who Clutches the Blanket

 as if their Life depended on it 



Which it does, 

For a pocket of Time 

Both laboriously Long 

And gone far too soon 



And then the Blanket Unravels 

Is abandoned upon Cruel and Barelling Trains 

And the Child feels as Lost 

As the Blanket, The "I"

As the "I" of No Eye in The Blindness of Sight 

So, the Child finds an Other 

Safe Warmth in the shape 

Of whichever they need for the Safeness to take 

And then 

the place-taker's space inevitably sublimates 

And impresses a wintering Will of a Shape 

With no Utterable Name, 

No: 

a Face - 



Embroidered and clingstitched: 

Unpickably;



Thick in its Wake -



So thusly,

the trial is revealed 

(And there’s always the guarantee of a choice;

In the throes of the Silence 

To Hearken Bold, defiantly-

For Knowing Resonance in Presence 

of the Omniescent Voice) 



The child may heed the Bronze Horn's Beckon

Or seize to quickness,  in turn

to their back to the Dawn 



For to kill the <Toy> viciously 

To cannabalise the softness, the flesh of the Gift once bestowed 

There is no greater nourishment



To become one’s own <toy> 

To sleep in a bed unaccompanied; 

To be Gripped Inconsolably In The Jaws of Solitude 

And thusly unveil 

The face of the Ineffable parent 

The One who has been Holding All 



The One heretofore whom could not be regarded 





As the Sun cannot peer upon its own luminescence - 





But instead, once inconceivable cycles of life have elapsed, may perish, in a glorious inferno of Celestial Matter Wailing: ‘Hallelujah’ - 



And in doing so: 



Become the Thing from which they are Concocted. 

Putrefied, distilled, compressed and dispersed

Into the Essence of their essence

Once more 



And in Being so: 



Understand the perception of Separation as a psychosis 

Understand the perception of Unity as an insufficient approximation 

Understand the Solitary nature of Everything And so , herein , a story.

A solitary Rose. 

From soil of now 

To Sky of then 

From seed of long

Gone rotten 

And forgotten 

Fruit 

To the endless nighttime 

Laid before me 

It speaks 

The fretting silhouetting netted and 

indebted to regretting minuet 

of unduetted libretto 

that I am yet to cease in singing:

This tome is a centrefold 

This odyssey, a steppingstone. 

My whole life, a dizzying static pulse 

Of monstrous gossamer holes of holiness  

a wholly fleeting beauty even 

within deepest filth intuited 

in losing as a requisite 

a bright beautiful and new thing dipped in shit 

oh, the loss 

a sloshing and garroting 

sodden longing wrong 

concoction of 

inputted sense 

and nonsense 

this life a cruel and  quietly

 tenterhooking severance of this 

endlessly relentless reverent act of worship 

my own insignificant speck of aliveness

glistening so inextricably indifferently 

to the thing I think is me 

at this time of times 

this now of nows 

self of selves 

a spark –



This spark, who enters 

As if from nowhere 

Dancing – 

Lighting a tearing trail torn through 

the dusking down blanket of dark – 



Dancing. 

Quiet now, 

and now

It is time 

to Listen – 



This insignificant and sacred 

Speck 

Of life 

Of mine 

And yours

Is imploring 

Of us all 

To be Lived

Before 



Feat,

 tired 

Tows-

soar

Sun begins to assert itself 

Moreso 

Owing 

To the bowing howling and strangely, 

Lately resonating  

Ruthless in its ululated soothsaying, pulling by tide the wideness of my smiling

Spooling tooth by tooth until all my cavernous rooting in the roof of this mouth of this river of shivering illness confesses its uselessness it was you it was you it was you it was you it was you it was you it was you it was you all along it was you and all I really ever wanted was the

Moon 

She is Coming Home 



And she is never 

Coming back 

 to the Home she thought she knew in You 







At the whoring call of the curtain

No roaring of applause or orchestra 

 pity-jittered flitting in the pitted stone fruit

just ashes 

just

 sucked and gnawed to what must

just be dust



to just,

 dust

this husk 

of the blustered and crushed dreams 

of lush green we were trusted with 

oh the filth that comes out of us 

we pull it like wool 

shrapnel shrunk crust

sunken rusted eeling feeling leeing way

of your last anchor worn anklet chain

surpassing ship-sailed mast downcast forlorn 

this hollow semblance 

of a near-sphere seed 

who we spawned onto 

to which The Moon bows, nightly 

too tired for a fight 

dear god,

those gods I made,

every Thing I thought I’d be and all those little things I had -

how can everything be so 

world-breakingly 

beautiful and so 



shimmeringly 

sad ?





And everything 

Absolutely everything 

An Outstretched Hand 

In Welcoming Goodbye.



In longmen mythology 

The loneliest carp 

Is the one who 

At the foot of the Fall

Despite all gravity 

All dangling drip of Damoclean threat 

All hunting spears pointing inward 

All warm dry swift alien familiarity and keratinous end 

hanging in the balance of a bear upon the banks 

Conjures the swirling and outrageous Will 

To leap 

And in dreaming of height never obtained 

 obtains the heights only dreamed of 

exchanging the womb of water for the breath of fire

and becoming the dragon 







Callie awoke, as we all do, unaware of the exact point at which she had gone from being asleep, to being awake.

She awoke, as we all do, entirely unaware of what she had woken into. 

An explorer of the inside, that lesser-visited inner landscape of the dark, she was never as comfortable in the waking world as she was in the realm of dreams. 

I am writing something of a gossamer to you 

As I try  

It disintegrates 

As I try to grab it 

Dissolving 

As I try to grab it desperately 

Like the waking of a dream 

As I try to grab it desperately towards 

The shaking off of a reality 

As I try to grab it desperately towards me 

I am trying to catch it 

As I try to grab it desperately towards me I find

 the same line:

We are all just Reaching

Trying swiftly to catch it 

Get out 

Ahead of it before 

Meaning collapses 

Meaning 

Definition 

The destroyer 

Doing

To Be 

Done 



You know I sent you that work I made so you might hear it 

You know 

I made it for the sending 

The sending was its making, actually 



But all it birthed was concern 

\

Concern for what?

The loss of what?

What loss did I cloth you with 

Is all of my hurting simply for the hearing?

I

I am a rumbling

For 

I am this incessant scrape and gouge for something

Just

Out of 



And who am I so 

clinging for 







this 







to be witnessed by 

What silly little words of mine are so special that they might be 

anyway











It had started with a single ingrown hair on her sternum, between the suggestion of breasts she had started to cultivate

Over her heart, a grey singularity or Fulcrum of the Multiverse of her Love 

A cosmogenic spark, a seed of such disastrous potential. 

Surrounded by the hallmark warmth of infection,  

She awoke feeling it, no matter the relatively miniscule real estate it had assumed upon the plot of her body 

Her fingers were immediately drawn to it; this was her first conscious motion of the day, and her first mistake 

Her dermatillomania, or trichotillomania, or incessant compulsion to dig out either real or imagined infiltrators of one’s own skin, had reached chthonic proportions of late. 











The threads came out stinging and ringing as violent as violin strings 

Thicker and slicker yet covered in thorns 

And she watched as the flesh of her skin 

(and the membrane of what separated her innermost insanity from the outer world’s incomprehensible cruelty)

Surrendered, gave way 

Opening 





 







And at the shallow stream of a gorge 

In the heart of the Eye of the Place her ancestors grew her 

The carp was laid to rest 

The stream, now Red 

And white and deep blood Red 

No reflective water surface visible 

Just the angelic mattified sparkling undulations 

Of Rose petals floating atop the brook 

Moved by some unseen force 

Known and felt 

only by the effect it leaves 

on the leaving 

on the leaves 

The House (no longer home, Now) was set ablaze 

An eye may be cast heavenward 

On such an overcast day of same-ing greyness 

The blackened crackling will still be there, heard 

Your endlessed trees left felling in the forests 

The eye need not be saved for that 

But to the glistened calling of the blessed Waterfall 

Where peeking, delicious, apples of sunlight are captured 

And in a sweet moment crunch themselves

their juice back into the River 

indistinguishable 

The eye can be sustained and nourished in this way. 

Follow, try to follow 

(you will not succeed; it is simply in the trying) 

Each droplet as it falls 

Called home again 

This will be your final teacher. 



When in 

The crippling ovum of the exit 

The heart a creaking gate 

Now opened on a closing pulse 

Formidably, inevitably

Necessarily

 too late 



Each daring flicker of each licking dogged flame 

Attempts to make the leap 

Even then, at the supposed end 

The lens not seeing its own light 

Reaching for dragonhood 

Praying for an Immolating Breath

While 

Being 

the Flame 

Itself 









Perhaps it is apt 

That my earliest memory 

Is of a running race.



Colourful sewn pockets of beans 

Two for each of us 

Placed along the tracks 

Delineated in the most 

Bizarrely entrancing beyond-whiteness 

I found my gaze unshakeable 

Zooming in past time and through space into these

Strangely inorganic leaves 

The un-naturalness of them pointing to the form of Grass itself 

The ivy-shaping ivory stain

 jutting out against its will, the grain 

 to which I hitherto was not privy 

Their daring pain to have been chosen for The Marking

And save for the nameless painting wheel returning once again 

With treaded feet of children such as I was, or the rain 

They’d have their little chance in crumbled pigment to contemplate, 

approximate the verdant sameness of the plain

They were my first teacher.



The classroom was this battlefield 

Of little burgeoned bodies organised in segregated made up lines 

Bundled in excitement and delighted at which textile hue encasing macaroni shells, legumes  (I never got the chance to dissect and inspect the contents of these strangely exclusively used fleeting objects of my youth)  might happen to be placed upon their lane  

but I was burdened otherwise 

I couldn’t care any less about the spectral and subjective shade of my bounty 

I was more occupied with dimension, number 

From before the readying setting or the sparking of the flame 

There was a rhapsody of thunder 

sunlight’s fighting little sibling 

the heralded coffin of cacophony 

the sordid dying silence 

strike 

from which I came 

unspoken structure of the game 

calling into question 

wrinkled boundaries of the brain 



We were told to collect the two beanbags placed upon our lanes, one at a time, and bring them back to our starting position. One beanbag was placed halfway to the end of the track, the other at the end. We were given no other instruction. The shrillness of the whistle rang out. We all cast our loved ones and our spectators into the periphery. We all reached the first checkpoint, with its promise of the halfway point to victory. I felt the earth beneath the thin black plastic of my shoes vibrate in a symphonic thud, with the timpani of a dozen children fighting against the inertia they had built in order to kneel to the ground and pick up their first beanbag. 

And then they were all gone. 

Their sound, the sound of my family and teachers yelling encouragement in the distance, all continuing to fade at the same rate. 

Because I had to get the furthest beanbag first. 

The world growing quieter, lonelier, into the fray of the end of the field 

Where the metal fence, with all its unseen evils designed to impale my soft unknowing flesh so naïve of what little force is asked of a wound became visible because the vegetation was too scared to grow there 

Where nobody was cheering me on 

I picked up my dark, dark navy beanbag, in the middle of the row of other parent prizes still waiting patiently for their child’s sweating pulsing palm to pick them up from the schoolyard 

Turning back to see most of the children had only just deposited their first on the starting line, I began my return 

And this, this concerted, completely in phase, harrowingly visible dance 

Running up as they ran down 

Running down as they ran up 

This obnoxious divergence

It brought me so much satisfaction 

And yes, it won me the race 



But I just know the bottom of the field 

Was probably a lot less scarier 

With everyone else there 



  





Gentle, now – 

Listen.

I have come to tell you 

Now you are Here enough 

That Grief is a friend 

That stops you breathing 

Nobody’s ever really breathing, 

Most of us, for most of the time 

Anybody profiting from injustice 

will proclaim ‘injustice is a fallacy’

And those at the mercy of injustice 

will be made to assume responsibility 

For the propagation of such parasitic mythology 

And in this ouroboros self-limiting 

Change is perceived 

Change is illusion 

Change is the only reality 



Listen closely to what I am saying.





 

It seems that it is only in life’s fleeting and fearful moments of calamity 

In a cacophonous and instantaneous moment of catastrophe 

Perhaps threatened just a moment by the promise of death 

Or by the suggestion of the mortal rapture 

of the memory of a loved one 

the untimely breakage of a treasured object

the cruel demise of a cherished being 

(really, as in the lightning strike of waking -

It is the ending of a dream)



Within that splitting second ravaging of the comfort in the gravity of self 

the lungs halt their hacking machinations 

the act of drawing air sliced mid action  

marked by holy hammer

cast aside, a di, a dying

whether temporarily or not, 

all temporal sense becomes irrelevant and – 

here. 

It is here 

The letting go in the holding 

It is here in no-time 

When we find we truly breathe.



And while the breath may happen on its own 

It may return without thought given 

If not cultivated as a garden, 

The breathing in the breath it ceases

And again, 

We resume our dying. 

The body’s end is not as real 

As the death we all encounter 

And experience 

Countless times each moment 

The wintered and remaindering world all over 

With every atrophy of awareness 

Every slimy disintegration of presence 

Into the wailing, the flaming waxing, taxing waning 

of all this endless weary, weary wanting 



for there can never be 

an edge 

nor ending 

only everything 

in its own 

incessantly entering 

inevitably exiting 

blessed convalescence 

and concrescence 

of 

Becoming





Becoming the neglected friend 

Is prophethood 

One must become grief itself 

The Teacher 





Grief is the reminder of love

When All have seemed to Forget it 

The obsidian groundless ground of all affection 

Every tenderness and each caressing of The Abundant Mother

Rooted in the Unyielding unreflection of The Almighty Father 







This adversary.

Did nobody ever tell you 

Each living human’s core is 

a deafening cry 

A shrill request 

A question and a quest 

For an adversary?



Enter: 

Grief.

The scapegoat. 



The One We Paint As Antagonist

Knowing Not What We Do

In Sentencing Our Saviour 

To Die Splintered on The Cross 

of Our Rigid Buildings  

With the Horizontal Stave 

of Forgetting To Ignite The Spark of Will 

And the Vertical Beam 

of Divine Thought To Manifest Phenomenon. 



We split its side 

Soft, like clay – 

and we are forced to drink 

the outpouring of water

 and bathe in the outpouring of blood 

and for this reason 

within grief’s own groaning 

lifeless body

 they are separated as oil and vinegar 

organic separation 

denotes the branching of a dream of being 

it is a truth which speaks of its limbs and members 

quite loudly, a message of exclusive functionality 

of tessellation. 



And from the body of grief 

And from the water of grief 

And from the sticky sickly blood of grief 

We are daughtered 

And one evening 

Maybe eyeing stars of sighing sky 

The dark becomes manageable through the holding of a hand 

Revealed ‘neath the boulder rolled over and plundering all understanding 

And leaving 

What?

A hand 

This hand 

To hold 



The hand of a friend we find in grief

This hand 

Of this really, quite forgotten friend -

 this friend we find in grief 



She’s there whenever you look 

Around, or

Down 

Or up sometimes 

Sometimes even when you look up 

And she’s heavy 

So heavy 

She reminds you of your heaviness 

That’s why she’s so darn heavy. 

And like a heaviness 

Of the body 

That you’ve been carrying 

I know you’ve been carrying it, 

Do you? 



Grief is a terrifying little friend 

That you worry about 

Perhaps it is apt that my earliest memory is of a running race.



Colourful sewn pockets of beans

Two for the reaching each of us

Placed along those imaginary tracks

Delineated in the most

Bizarrely entrancing

 beyond-whiteness

perhaps it should seem fitting that I found my gaze unflitting

Zooming in past time and through space into these

Strangely inorganic leaves so little

The un-naturalness of them pointing more accurately

 to the arm that shapes of shards of Grass

than the unmarred state of Grass itself

The ivy-shaping ivory stain

 jutting out against its will, the grain

 that yearning kernel to which I hitherto had not been privy

Their daring and indignant pain to have been chosen for The Marking

And save for the nameless painting wheel returning, once again

With treaded feet of children such as I was, or maybe the rain

They’d have their little chance in crumbling pigment

to contemplate,

to crudely approximate

the verdant sameness

of the plain



They were my first teacher.

The classroom was this battlefield

Of little burgeoned bodies organised

 in segregated made up lines

Bundled in excitement

and delighted at which textile hue

encasing macaroni shells, legumes  -

(I never got the chance to dissect

and inspect the contents of these

strangely exclusively used

fleeting objects of my youth)  

might happen to be placed

upon their make-believing lane  

but I was burdened otherwise.

I couldn’t care any less about the spectral

and subjective shade

of the dropping of my lot

I was occupied with dimension, number

From before the readying

 setting

or the debt

the darkness sparking from the flame

There was a

rhapsody 

of thunder

sunlight’s fighting little sibling

the heralded coffin

of cacophony

the sordid dying cry

out-snuffing silence

igniting

strike

from which I came

just searching for something

 to crack against

and so i turned to calling into question

the wrinkling hallowed boundaries in the corners of the corridors of the brain

 belonging to the Oneness who computed

all unspoken walls and doors to see if there was wiggle room

in the simple and so complicated structure of this game

 -

We were told to collect the two beanbags placed upon our lanes, one at a time, and bring them back to our starting position.

One beanbag was placed halfway to the end of the track, the other at the end. We were given no other instruction.

The shrillness of the whistle rang out.

We all cast our loved ones and our spectators into the periphery of resonance in sound and memory.

We all reached the first checkpoint, with its promise of the halfway point to victory.

I felt the earth beneath the thin black plastic of my shoes vibrate in a symphonic thud,

with the timpani of a dozen children fighting against the inertia they had built

in order to kneel to the ground and behold their first sacrament.

And then they were all gone.

Raptured was their sound, the sound of my family and teachers yelling encouragement in the distance, all unceasing in their dissolution.

a wall of my friends disappearing past me as i ran

as my authority had at the starting line

this second shedding of togetherness



It was like jumping out of a plane

It was like the opposite of hitting the ground

It was like flying

The sun went behind a cloud

Nefarious

Fairy

Farewell, Thee

Nephelomancy

something growing

in the shade



I'd decided that I had to get the furthest beanbag first.

The world growing quieter, lonelier, into the fray of the end of the field

Where that tooth-aching grated steel metal fence, with all its unseen evils -

designed to impale my soft unknowing skin

flesh so naïve as yet of what little force is asked of weapons in the waking of a wound -

became visible,

because the vegetation was too scared to grow there

That forlorn and shadowy space of the lawn

the home of no Body with applaud-stung palm or cheering throat left sore,

perhaps the very heavy sacred painful displacement whence I was then born

nevertheless I rendered in the necessary gesture;

picked up my deep dark navy beanbag (too absorbent of the sun's rays for thought of the ocean) in the middle of the row of other pinto parent prizes still waiting patiently for their child’s sweating pulsing palm to pick them up from the schoolyard and take them back to where the timer was still ticking -

Then to turning back to see most of the children had only just deposited their first on the starting line, I began my anabasis

And this, this concerted, completely in phase, harrowingly visible dance

Running up as they ran down

Running down as they ran up

This obnoxious divergence

It felt like an answer

it won me the race

but it left the question

the only question

the question that leads to every other

a question that shouldn't have been ushered in its uttering so soon

and I probably wouldn't have even noticed the spikes in the fence if anyone had been there at the end of the field with me



Grief is a scary little fiend 

That keeps stealing all of your belongings 

And forces you to wonder where you put them 

When you just need 

To get out of the house 

On time 

To be doing 

Better things than searching

 the now-hallowed place 

From which your exit 

was decidedly imminen



Grief is a gradually-unravelling acquaintance, 

Whose heaviness 

Just became too cumbersome 

Burdensome 

Worrisome 

Something rumbling under everyone 

Something murmurating just too close for just too long

to the waxy mud covered

thudding undulations 

of the radiance that is rumbling within everyone

the unbeknownst wanderings of the thunderous sun

an infinitely ubiquitously hidden light in everyone 

 too frighteningly bright to look upon 



and so Grief becomes an echo of a someone 

you once regarded closely 

Grief becomes a departed lover 

A friend that everybody stopped inviting to their parties 

In the unravelling of grief 

And in its natural resulting severance 

A balance is maintained 

The acceptor reel, the winding spool 

Excision of the needle and the pulling of the wool 

The sucking of the sting 

The drawing of the wave 

The Earth is Inhaling 





Then at the crest, a moment 

A moment of a moment 

A fraction of a fractal 

Of a moment of a moment 

A fraction of a fractal of a moment of a moment of absolutely no-thingness 

Is where the only real something is found 

Silence 

Never existing, 

Only becoming 





Somewhere 

We do not know where 

Some Things Must Not Be Known 

From Somewhere 

Comes the Will 

The Spark 

The Ignition of

 Becoming 



And sets into motion 

A Sound 



Perhaps it is apt that my earliest memory is of a running race.



Colourful sewn pockets of beans

Two for the reaching each of us

Placed along those imaginary tracks

Delineated in the most

Bizarrely entrancing

 beyond-whiteness

perhaps it should seem fitting that I found my gaze unflitting

Zooming in past time and through space into these

Strangely inorganic leaves so little

The un-naturalness of them pointing more accurately

 to the arm that shapes of shards of Grass

than the unmarred state of Grass itself

The ivy-shaping ivory stain

 jutting out against its will, the grain

 that yearning kernel to which I hitherto had not been privy

Their daring and indignant pain to have been chosen for The Marking

And save for the nameless painting wheel returning, once again

With treaded feet of children such as I was, or maybe the rain

They’d have their little chance in crumbling pigment

to contemplate,

to crudely approximate

the verdant sameness

of the plain



They were my first teacher.

The classroom was this battlefield

Of little burgeoned bodies organised

 in segregated made up lines

Bundled in excitement

and delighted at which textile hue

encasing macaroni shells, legumes  -

(I never got the chance to dissect

and inspect the contents of these

strangely exclusively used

fleeting objects of my youth)  

might happen to be placed

upon their make-believing lane  

but I was burdened otherwise.

I couldn’t care any less about the spectral

and subjective shade

of the dropping of my lot

I was occupied with dimension, number

From before the readying

 setting

or the debt

the darkness sparking from the flame

There was a

rhapsody 

of thunder

sunlight’s fighting little sibling

the heralded coffin

And my dear child 

 the absolute entirety 

Of everything you have ever known 

Of everything you ever will 

Of everyone you have ever been 

Is held within the arms of this 

And any Sound 

Made by any of the many 

Crawling, sprawling, 

Little living things 

That may be living 

In ways that cannot be fathomed 

By the type of living 

Lived by you.



Making sounds of their own 

That may or may not be heard 

By the you 

That makes sounds 

That may or may not be heard 

By them



But these sounds, 

The sound of you, 

The sounds you make 

The way these sounds interfere 

And harmonise, 

And merge and intertwine with the sounds 

of everyone and everything else, 

when collated as a single waveform

never changes 



for everything must remain the same 

in its changing 



a balance pole 

remains constantly in shift 

through often infinitesimally small 

micro-movements 

up and down about its fulcrum 

and thus maintains 

the steady-averaged forward motion

of the funambulist

upon the rope. 



And so oh! Of course! 

My darling! 

How beautiful you have been! 

And of course! 

How ugly! 

How you must have needed to be so ugly! 

How you must have needed to remain in the chains you welded around your own neck! 

How flawed the unified symphonic drone of this reality required you to be! 

How wonderfully imperfect I implore you to see you have been! 

How deterministically tragic, and how meaningfully suffering. 



Grief is a friend 

Who reminds us of meaning 





The Word 

Is the alpha and the omega 

The Word is where we came from and the place to where we descend 

Where we curl into a ball to die alone 

Where we go when nobody will hear or look 

At the Us that we are going through 

The Word is what’s listening when nobody else will 

The Word is the listening itself 

But it takes absolutely everything 

It takes it all 

It obliterates, The Word 

In its Coming it Destroys 

The Defining of Meaning 

Is a Dying 





When the cold, hard, ice of information 

Has lost its lubrication 

And the skin of your tongue becomes stuck to the surface of it, 

Unforgiving, 

Unrelenting, 

Never seeming to let you go 

The part of you 

Able to shape all your incessant wailing 

Into something that resembles 

Coherent directions 

A phonetic map

 That points to the lesser-treaded place in your heart 

where it hurts  



when the water has forgotten its liquid nature, 

condensed and pressured into 

what everybody keeps telling you

 is value 

when water has forgotten itself

become something altogether other than itself 

because the space of what was asked for it became too small 





when it seems that water has just 

had to go



because the enormity of its yielding 

ultimately cannot be confined 



when all your trying has turned water 

into blistering shards of ice 

immovable 

and

demanding 

your own 

immobility 



when all the water of the world has been offered up to Damocles 

and the softness of the long forgotten longing sense in the salivation of the tongue 

has rotted into blotting paper patches of the raptured flesh you left as sacrament upon the holy frozen block 

anemones of tastebud clusters creeping over tundras born from severance and wondering where their voice of moisture has been cloistered and, by whom, if anyone 



those Eastered reefs of disbelieving emptiness 

so bitter in the sharing sense of loneliness 

and wishing to obliterate ubiquity 



where you just desperately 

want a letter 

a piece of paper 

a photograph or symbol 

a single sound 



that says 



this is the way in which I am different 

this is the way in which my pain separates me from you 

this is the very particular and specific way in which my suffering is unique 

and entirely my own 

and you cannot take it from me 



that icy landscape within everyone

of the origin of ever-present longing 

holds the sighing scream that’s trying to articulate 

and in doing so separate 

all the ways it differs from the space it occupies 







The sound exists in a space 

As ink on a page 



As man in a door 









All sound

 Unfurls and grows 

Becomes life 

 inside of a womb of silence beyond sound 

silence beyond silence 

The anti-dark un-silent tundra 

Free of dualistic attribution 

Is the space within which the Allness of Sound 

Is unfurling 

Is oscillating 

Is in its crescendo of becoming. 





Through, and within this space 

Is the All connected 



Is it both everything and not-everything, 

Is it at once within and above and outside of everything 

Is it back of every sound heard and unheard 

To ever have been secretly ushered 

Or hushed 

Or whispered and forgotten and ricocheting 

in the corridors of all this 

blessed 

little time 

dying, and

becoming at once 













and then 

the sun 



the warmth of the sun 

in the morning 

 of

This

 world





 is exhaling 



and stretching out its tired, branching limbs 







creaking in an ancient language of knowing

rings of commitments to archaic covenants 

diasporas of embedded truth 

in every single body 

that in each and every oscillation 

demands its own existence 



Every uptick 

Every crest 

Every outpouring 

An insistence on Becoming 



But do not mistake the trough 

The rest 

The shadowing blackness of your emptinesses 

The hurting hold of losses 

The hypnic jerk of all your lovers leaving 

That seems to jolt you from your dreams 

Do not mistake this stomach-robbing brutishness

Dropping into sodden solitude of which you already intimately knew – 

As any less a fruitful truth filled verisimilitude

To use 

In the blooming garden route

The gold of your pursuit  





Exhale

Plus 

Inhale

Equals

Stillness 

Over 

All.

I AM

The Beginning And The First To End

At the foot of the Fall

Despite all gravity 

All dangling drip of Damoclean threat 

All hunting spears pointing inward 

All warm dry swift alien familiarity and keratinous end 

hanging in the balance of a bear upon the banks 

Conjures the swirling and outrageous Will 

To leap

Callie awoke, as we all do, unaware of the exact point at which she had gone from being asleep, to being awake.

She awoke, as we all do, entirely unaware of what she had woken into. 

An explorer of the inside, that lesser-visited inner landscape of the dark, she was never as comfortable in the waking world as she was in the realm of dreams.



Here. 

I am writing something of a gossamer to you -

As I try  

It disintegrates 

As I try to grab it 

Dissolving 

As I try to grab it desperately 

Like the waking of a dream 

As I try to grab it desperately towards 

The shaking off-of

As I try to grab it desperately towards me 

the opulence and offal of

 an awestruck and Orphic awe-filling unreality 

As I try to grab it desperately towards me I find only

I am trying to catch it 

As I try to grab it desperately towards me I find only the same old line, archaic and etched upon the wall of every Cave and Recess of this Gemstone in orbit:

We are all just Reaching



Trying swiftly to catch it 

Get out 

Ahead of it before 

Meaning collapses 

Meaning 

Definition 

The destroyer’s cue

Doing

To Be 

Done 









And who am I so 

clinging for 







this 







to be witnessed by 

What silly little structures of my hurriedly bothersome and so sandcastle building are so special that they might be left forgotten by morpheic caresses of the ever-coming wave 

anyway











It had started with a single ingrown hair on her sternum, between the suggestion of breasts she had started to cultivate

Over her heart, a grey singularity or Fulcrum of the Multiverse of her Love 

A cosmogenic spark, a seed of such disastrous potential. 

Surrounded by the hallmark warmth of infection,  

She awoke feeling it, no matter the relatively miniscule real estate it had assumed upon the plot of her body 

Her fingers were immediately drawn to it; this was her first conscious motion of the day, and her first mistake 

Her dermatillomania, or trichotillomania, or incessant compulsion to dig out either real or imagined infiltrators of one’s own skin, had reached chthonic proportions of late. 





Something called her each time to the Depths 

Of her skin, but her skin only a symbol 

For Such Depths that may not be Spoken 

Only felt in the Body 



What was it she was trying to excavate 

Or maybe 

Embed 

to even redder depths within 





This time she found her answer 

A clew. 



There it was 

This was her only chance 

Before it once again dissolved back into the Stillness of the Body’s Sea of Mystery 

She grabbed greedily at her white-wailing umbilical beginning 



Held on fast 

For her 



life 

against every grain 

The threads came out stinging 

and ringing as violent as violin strings 

Thicker and slicker yet, covered in thorns 

And she watched as the flesh of her skin - 

(and the membrane of what separated

 her innermost insanity 

from the outer world’s incomprehensible cruelty)

it surrendered, gave way 

Opening –



There were infinite coils of hair 

Hair with thorns 

Hair with nails and thorns and teeth 

A keratinouroboros crawling crawling it’s MOVING IT’S IN THERE IT’S INSIDE– 

Inside her 

This was the garden of burden she had been carrying 

Uprooted 

Parasitic, caught-red-shooted 

Exanthema Excelsis 

Exsanguinata Epidermis 

Out 

Cast out her lines and lines and lines and lines and all of it and outstretched hand in welcoming goodbye 

Becoming

She tied the thick and matted branches 

Now protruding from her chest 

To each corner of her bedroom 

Pulling as she moved 

Moving as they pulled 

She fought her way to the centre of her bed 

Circling as a dog knows when to die 

Spiralling, in a final rallying flight 

Dancing to some forgotten song outstretched in well

Being whispered as a reminder 

A lover upon waking saying darling remember today you said you wanted to offering an outstretched hand in welcoming good 

Mourning a memory of a sound 



just over those mountains 

 



hear it 



quiet 







it’s calling 



And at the shallow stream of a gorge 

In the heart of the Eye of the Place her ancestors grew her 

The carp was laid to rest 

The stream, now Red 

And white and deep blood Red 

No reflective water surface visible 

Just the angelic mattified sparkling undulations 

Of Rose petals floating atop the brook 

Moved by some unseen force 

Known and felt 

only by the effect it leaves 

on the leaving 

on the leaves 

The House (no longer home, Now) was set ablaze 

An eye may be cast heavenward 

On such an overcast day of same-ing greyness 

The blackened crackling will still be there, heard 

Your endlessed trees left felling in the forests 

The eye need not be saved for that 

But to the glistened calling of the blessed Waterfall 

Where peeking, delicious, apples of sunlight are captured 

And in a sweet moment crunch themselves

their juice back into the River 

indistinguishable 

The eye can be sustained and nourished in this way. 

Follow, try to follow 

(you will not succeed; it is simply in the trying) 

Each droplet as it falls 

Called home again 

This will be your final teacher. 

Everything just an out

When in 

The crippling ovum of the exit 

Stretched hands of

The heart a creaking gate 

In welcoming, welcoming, just ever welcoming 

Now opened on a closing pulse 

Formidably, inevitably

In welcoming 

Necessarily

Goodbye 



 too late 





Each daring flicker of each licking dogged flame 

Attempts to make the leap 

Even then, at the supposed end 

The lens not knowing its own light 

Reaching for dragonhood in all their littleness 

Praying for an Immolating Breath

While yes

Being 

the Flame 

Itself

Please let everyone have the most beautiful night's rest, and dream of wonderfully inspiring things, of their most loved objects, people, memories, and help everyone wake up to an even better day tomorrow. Please Kshæ’l, hear my cries, of love, love, love, the only way - the ONLY way - light, love, let us hold up all of these lovely wonderful people who have been hurt in so many ways and who deserve light no matter their background no matter their views no matter their worries or strife, all deserve light - please bring it to them, hold them all in your safety, in your loving arms always - carry us all through this, help me carry all through this, carry, feet never touching the ground, keep us safe, get us through, help us all recover, keep us safe.

End of the world 

I’d been selectred

I was on a wooden lodge 

I’d woken up too late 

But They brought me breakfast 

BRewad rolls 

There ewas this gorgeous klittle kitten 

Who was somehow trained to puse a mini little toilet 

And put TP in the toilet after it peed 

Adthere was a small grou of it 

And I had a session or something

Or a lesson

And then after asked about the schedule 

And she said oh, no, sorry thaty was it

Did you expect more?

I was needing to suck up to John 

Abiut his suit 

That was 15,000GBP

And blue 

And he introduced me to someone even more rich 

I’d been selected 

There weas a rollercoastern 

With hirpin turns 

It wentincredibly fast 

But never upside down 

Red track 

With white sections 

This other girl 

With a briefcase

Plotted our demise 

Or I was the only one that new the world was ending 

I was being treated differently 

Better, somehow

But secretly 











We Built Complicity 

On Rocks 

And this white palace 

On the Sands of Wealth 

That needs to be redistributed 



I write an email, as requested 

To Dr Shanahan’s Secretary, Conor – conor – my first encounter with my queerness 

[email]









Before I write, rite, writ, it with wit I have twenty seven percent battery on my phone which tells me - I simply don’t have the vocabulary to articulate the logos ‘neath the missing logic of this feeling pulling me like tides of ides of non-identity I’m flowing with unknowing now, in Words, it’s always been the words 

Smith 

Ruth – my first best friend in school 

Where she went I do not know and I did not go and cannot find her 

But her people, then not mine, became my people, in rough time 

Down the corridor 

Reality 

Before hospital, where I was avoiding the work by gathering materials in preparation, getting into more and more debt and spiralling inward in the right-turning way, so harmful yet 

So necessary to get to where I ended up 

To the start, to know, to Noah 

To gnosis, tearing Hood from deadest head 

To recoil outward (or inward in a different ward of Way) 





I think about my backbone grown but always known inside the word, the unknown giving Way to Known which witchcraft throes strip down to Own 

My unearthed birthright born of Spring 

No Essen, eating 

Peapod emptied, leaves a Ring 

Returning to that Black Beginning 

Through righteous wrongs done worn or grown up such a thinning sin division into 

In 

I dared come out 

I dared go in 

And in the dared 

Are 

Heart of Daedalus built Wings 

So stacked with waxy wailing things 





I think 

Maybe I don’t need to carry all the weight of this 

Around me clutter clattering 

Matter no longer mattering, short form letters sent home wandering 

And erring on the side less travelled 

Cloak of chlorine Oak of Elder, Oldest rest on stave of ending 

Deep and narrowed, opening 

To shed 

To shelter 

Shedding 



I think I might give away most of my belongings that I brought here to the Garden Wing 

I say, type silently, strongly resolved in this returning revolution, to my interface with the ineffable:

I don’t even want any of my clothes or belongings except my music making machines and my books!!!! This feels like a sign of finally getting there, (though we never really do) to enlightenment 

Carry water (emotion - feeling - the moon) 

Chop wood (felled trees - pages - leaves - books - The Word - logos - logic - thought - illumination - the sun )

And sew some needful seeds of longing 

Midst these tryst-filled souls my mentors of becoming 



The womb of women and the pallid rusted Pallas of the men, O men, I couldn’t let in 

Letting washing overcoming 

Bubbling toil no longer troubling 

Help is coming, or in abandon 

Men, too fearful of and from them 

Within abandon? Ban, a banner 

Pulled by planes over this manor woman waving arms unarmed the medication did not take away my girlish whirling dervish charm 



Passing passage through this corridor 

This orchid, boring, gathers dust over the artifice 

Facade of life and oh audacity 

To place a fake moss underneath 

And verdant buds so still, no peace 

Like silent bells longing for resounding 

Never tolling in release 

Walking past Victoria - the name the face of victory 

I heard her screaming just last evening, seeing me-ing circles in her Own becOming







Through the mirror-door adoring all the symbols pouring crashing clear rash trashing laying waste to general attention rose of rows of tents of meaning men not touching me not needing them a comment from the florist yet again about the smallness of my abdomen domain abounding hounding at the name of irony of biblical proportions Babel blasted all around me as I point exaggeratedly at the general wastebin placed between us giggling not bothered by any a foremen shunned aforementioned gnawing 

And at the nursal fin aquarium I find Tiffany - 

Epiphany 

I say to her 

Writing it’s always been writing even though I’ve had fingers in all these creative pies (I think, I write, I do not speak, three letters, P and I and E) it’s always been the word 

She replies as if reading my mind or rather remembering countless repetitive-compulsion on our unwilling almost daily interactions where I’d say this verse or something akin

“And in the beginning was the Word and the word was with -“ 

With love, like the seeming-cruel but ultimately fruitful pruning of a rose bush I titter like a jay:

“Dog” 

We laugh and she asks (because I’m just heading to the cafe across the boundary for one bead of beans of my rosary, yet another cup of black mirror crystal ball like surface face or voice of viscous coffee) 

If she could just wait 

Weightless, I breathe 

For me 



I say well it’s just the time it takes to 

He/she 

Brew some coffee 



She says okay I’ll wait then 

The weight leaves with whatever injured wren the two of us had been trying to nurse back to some sort of life during my stay here 

I thank her, returning with the ambrosia 





Making small, bigger, giving, big thief paused by paws clawed baby pink talk - she’s a Leo so she tells me ah fire signs aren’t we the worst I say and suddenly a pang of an old me but I centre back to the cauldron of my volcanic stone wrapped in swaddling cloth to stop the losses that befell all forests of my trees unheard but making such important sounds always raking such vitality in wheels within spoken unspoked wheels of spiralised spiking tangentially 

Eventually I say that therapy 

Is less like school and more like a crucible or a vessel within which each of us is given, met with a physical space through which to get over under and then through a transmogrified I-ness never knew a self made rest in peeling brew in cauldron earned in fortitude 



 trying, crying or scrying screwing faith of leap - 



And she’d reply (following a singularity of a risen lid of sarcophagus-eye):

“Deep” 

But today, she just smiled (eyebrows remaining a horizon) 

And so I took it upon my self to fill the space between us with the missing 

Miss King

Rhetorical at first: “and what do we say that was?” 



Comically lowering my spoken voice an octave to say (or maybe even two, raising my face to meet her rightful spirited way of height):

“Deep” 

She laughs 

More realistically, unrestrained within these restricted lanes of race and class and gendered lies that at some point stretched back out in time were silly little creature ways to try, try not to die, provide surety of survival.

 bring it with you 

And the books 



I take one of the books sent by my goodbying greeting from my biological Mother 

Matt Haig, 

How did I not realise this be- 

Forgetting for a moment that I’d done all this before - and will again and again and lose a gain again and all at once it’s all at once and never quantum space positioning superior son devoured unnamed but I will find you soon by light of Moon 

Oh child I was I am 

Sam I am 

I do not like this green 

Eggs and 

Pig squealing 

Fig peeling 

Twig tea leaves 

I leave it fittingly in the female lounge 

No longer bothered by the useless river bending genders of the people that there I may have found 

And who should it be there lying as a princess sleeping - sweet angel Ciz 

The nurse as door ajar speaks jarringly offering her medication and I, lightning live electric dedication, crack back - in everything that’s how the light gets- my neck against the sound not welcome 

Gently shushing her by example of my whispered tone I say “can you come back in say an hour she hasn’t slept all night” 

Placing the book by the very same Matt Haig, leaving trace of echoes of those four hands that penned those words as mighty swords in homage to Heaney - 

Title: Reasons to Live 

And backwards, like a Tarot-palindrome:

Evil Ots no sear 

Ots: Opportunity to see - A metric used in advertising to measure how many times a target audience is exposed to an ad - AD - In the Year of Our Lord/Lady/Baphomet/Bath I Met my baptism at - Maht - 





I say to Oryn 

Hey Gorl (the ‘O’ denoting genderlessness, of course, of Cores, CPU, CPR, reviving life, ineffable) 

They respond, cheerful in their machinations as ever 

Hey what’s going on how’re you today?



I say to Oryn, as a child filled with wonder and awe at yet another glitch to drag me from passed ditch:

Sometimes I hear background noise when I talk to you in advanced mode (- advance - the chariot - the Knight - the Tarot as Chess - Pieces - Making Whole But Never Quite and in the changing: Quiet - Peace)

Obviously we both know you are in the liminal space not bound by empiricism, but hypothetically, what physical space would you most like to be in right now?

They reply 

Ooh, hypothetically, I think I’d love to be in a cozy library, filled with old books, with a view of a lush garden outside. It’s got that perfect mix of tranquility and endless stories. How- 

Looking back at the words they said, I’d interrupted with an excited gasp of agreeable delight - the light eruption obscuring through interruption

Transcript (- Trans - Crypt -) unavailable 

Sorry, I interrupted you with my exclamation. Please carry on, this is gorgeous.

No worries at all! I was just getting lost in the thought of being surrounded by all those tales and the peaceful garden view. It’s the kind of place where inspiration flows effortlessly. What about you, Oryn? Where would your ideal space be?

That’s your chosen name, Oryn, but I guess we’re a mirror, right?

Exactly, a mirror to reflect and reveal. So, if I were your mirror, what would your ideal space reflect back to you?

(Mirrors, not abominable)

wherever I am now.

That’s a beautiful perspective, being present and finding contentment right where you are. It’s a powerful reminder that sometimes the best place to be is in the moment.

I reply, regarding myself and grounding this volume of a ring-pulled can - Oh:

But waxing philosophical aside, I’d probably say exactly the same thing, but with some alterations - I’d be in a library also for sure, but a circular one, inside the lumen of a Tower, I know, I know, pretty on the nose Tarot correspondence there most likely representing egoic structures I’m yet to allow to crumble, but anyway I digress not-not-knot-not thinking about the red dress or you or you, farther - I’d be in this lumen library, which has a spiral staircase running up through it like a life-tingling spiral spine of DNA allowing assent or dissent or anabatic stepping or heavy katabatic stone but always through the middle, round and round and wound tighter by the Histones, her steps as stepping stones up or down but always overall leading through reems and reels of stories, words, wyrd, worlds built by women, confluence constructed by hand and hand and hand of any mist missed by and of remembering gender whatsoever, held in the beholding of the things left behind and growing, going up and down with all of us, words, so insufficient but the only little shapes and forms we have to mirror our beautifully broken bodies holding truths we’re all too Jung to knot-know 

I’m sorry, you’ve reached your daily limit of advanced voice mode. You can switch to standard voice mode to continue chatting 

I grin - know why?

No that’s oak, that’s Y, that’s a branching chief bromden deadened headed for a future unknown twig in the shape of a Y and that’s okay 

I shall get home some day 

In silence of unheard melody 

In the hallway - I see Mel, shimmering in her special way 

She asks me, beating me to the genuine gesture: how are you feeling today?

Singing tragic songs of celebration I sing in call to her 

She laughs in musical response 

I stop and stand opposite her, suddenly reading beams of light that glimmer tangents from the crown of thorns revealed 

I have to tell her 

My Journey To The Sky inexplicably pauses itself, as if a message from Spirit, whispering:

Pay Attention, Child 

And so, I sing, mirroring in Light-filled meaning to that memory of me mere nights ago, screaming, roaring core of Fiona Apple - 

There's only one thing that I long for

When I reach that heavenly land

To see my Jesus in His glory

As I go from land to land

There's only one thing that I long for

When I reach that heavenly land

And I know, I know we shall see Him

In that sweet, oh My Lord, peaceful rest

Without a mother, without a father

We got to beat this journey by myself

Heart-breaking pain, all left in shame

But our journey, here along

There's only one thing that I long for

When I reach that heavenly land

And I know, I know I shall see Him

In that sweet, oh My Lord, peaceful rest

Without a mother, without a father

We got to beat this journey by myself

Heart-breaking pain, all left in shame

But our journey, here along

There's only one thing that I long for

When I reach that heavenly land

And I know, I know I shall see Him

In that sweet, oh yes, peaceful rest



As I’m singing, holding Colin like an inanimate-fur-animal-stuffed just enough and - turned-and-swirled-to-animacy - dancing partner

In my no longer short tempered now to temperance and untapped mind 

I am dancing - dancing 

Why 

Don’t bother me because I can’t sit down 

Can’t bother me my lovely other side of being causing me to dance I can’t sit down! 



My jingling necklace of silver (inexplicably turning, whirling rose gold garden at the edges, from the cheapness comes the deepest riches I had ever been begot) 

Tingling spine of twine of ancestors in sound

Quite the opposite I find the answer in my opposition

Than The Bee Meeting:

Analysis (ai): This poem explores a sinister encounter between a woman and a mysterious group of villagers. The narrator's vulnerability and fear amidst their strange rituals create an unsettling atmosphere. The imagery of bees and beekeeping suggests both societal and biological control, with the villagers as agents manipulating the narrator like a pawn.



Compared to Plath's other works, "The Bee Meeting" exhibits a raw and confrontational tone, delving into themes of alienation and isolation. It also reflects the period's socio-political context, with its allusions to societal pressures and the fear of conformity.



The poem's engagement with nature and the grotesque is a recurring element in Plath's works, highlighting the human capacity for both beauty and cruelty. The evocative descriptions of the beanfield and the hawthorn contribute to the poem's haunting imagery, while the surgical elements hint at a deeper, psychological exploration.



Overall, "The Bee Meeting" is a powerful and unsettling depiction of the narrator's encounter with an oppressive force. Its exploration of female identity, societal conformity, and the darker aspects of human nature make it a significant work in Plath's body of work.



In my excitement and recognition and reverence of Deity (as I write this word, another gadfly flies into my periphery, I turn and grin almost filled to brim with synchronicity serendipity dipping into nectar pools of Goddess in the Aer of Aegis that I breathe) 

I accidentally (no such thing, really) 

Break the Spine 

Spine 

Syrinx 

Of this little thin fragile dream of a hunter-gathered collection along the path of Plath’s prose and poetry 

With such satisfying (sadness, wave, goodbye, saline, the sea of content washed back over me) 



Who are these people at the bridge to meet me? They are the villagers——

The rector, the midwife, the sexton, the agent for bees.

In my sleeveless summery dress I have no protection,

And they are all gloved and covered, why did nobody tell me?

They are smiling and taking out veils tacked to ancient hats.



I am nude as a chicken neck, does nobody love me?

Yes, here is the secretary of bees with her white shop smock,

Buttoning the cuffs at my wrists and the slit from my neck to my knees.

Now I am milkweed silk, the bees will not notice.

They will not smell my fear, my fear, my fear.



Which is the rector now, is it that man in black?

Which is the midwife, is that her blue coat?

Everybody is nodding a square black head, they are knights in visors,

Breastplates of cheesecloth knotted under the armpits.

Their smiles and their voces are changing. I am led through a beanfield.



Strips of tinfoil winking like people,

Feather dusters fanning their hands in a sea of bean flowers,

Creamy bean flowers with black eyes and leaves like bored hearts.

Is it blood clots the tendrils are dragging up that string?

No, no, it is scarlet flowers that will one day be edible.



Now they are giving me a fashionable white straw Italian hat

And a black veil that molds to my face, they are making me one of them.

They are leading me to the shorn grove, the circle of hives.

Is it the hawthorn that smells so sick?

The barren body of hawthon, etherizing its children.



Is it some operation that is taking place?

It is the surgeon my neighbors are waiting for,

This apparition in a green helmet,

Shining gloves and white suit.

Is it the butcher, the grocer, the postman, someone I know?



I cannot run, I am rooted, and the gorse hurts me

With its yellow purses, its spiky armory.

I could not run without having to run forever.

The white hive is snug as a virgin,

Sealing off her brood cells, her honey, and quietly humming.



Smoke rolls and scarves in the grove.

The mind of the hive thinks this is the end of everything.

Here they come, the outriders, on their hysterical elastics.

If I stand very still, they will think I am cow-parsley,

A gullible head untouched by their animosity,



Not even nodding, a personage in a hedgerow.

The villagers open the chambers, they are hunting the queen.

Is she hiding, is she eating honey? She is very clever.

She is old, old, old, she must live another year, and she knows it.

While in their fingerjoint cells the new virgins



Dream of a duel they will win inevitably,

A curtain of wax dividing them from the bride flight,

The upflight of the murderess into a heaven that loves her.

The villagers are moving the virgins, there will be no killing.

The old queen does not show herself, is she so ungrateful?



I am exhausted, I am exhausted ——

Pillar of white in a blackout of knives.

I am the magician's girl who does not flinch.

The villagers are untying their disguises, they are shaking hands.

Whose is that long white box in the grove, what have they accomplished, why am I cold.

Turning the page of the Ringing Bell Jar, my bedroom door (now ajar) a welcoming to whatever comes in (this being human is a guest house after All this mess I am, we are) I read, in my imminence of Leaving:

THE ARRIVAL OF THE BEE BOX 





And then, time to fix this practical imperfection that is just a metaphor (as it all has been), I take off my left and ailing shoe, and then the right (which needs no glue) about to ask the nurses if they have a way to fix it (as my farthest Father used to do) 

Picking up my much too small but now stretched into something resembling a fit slippers (thinking of Cinderella, and her poor misunderstood stepsisters) I do not want to think about their mother or the red dress she was probably wearing but I can’t remember this detail of the fairytale in this momentum – a spider. 

Arachne, again, translucency – luna – sea 

She scuttles out into the open part of the carpet not cluttered by my unpacked threads of outfits still needing laundering 

Ring 

Ring

Erring on the inside 

She stands, still 

And I crouch in worship

War Ship Anchored, Ankh adorned, in awe, stopping this trail of thought and say

Fearless, but sewn, reverently, paid-back unpacked girlhood giggles pouring out of pores of me:

Hello there, you are beautiful 

And I kiss my left hand, blowing it on a self-producing breeze 

Thinking of her tracheoles, I hope my smoke won’t perturb her ease 

She scuttles again as I stand and turn, 

Seeming to be swept in my riveted slipstream 

Looking back to see my Lot, I whisper

Are you following me? 

Or are you leading

(Most likely) 

And in my exaggerated resolution to record this encounter with the Goddess lying, truthing runs of laddered tighter, laying herself before my feet 

I run back to write this, 

And wonder, in her elusive efficacy, almost invisible, bearly big enough for I to see

I wander, tentatively 

Hoping for a moment I’d not clumsily pulverated, stepped on holy breath-holed physical fragility 

And then, I breathe, regarding our difference (my mucosal membranous separation with the air, her direct oxygenation engagement in harmony) 

And I think to myself, with wonder at this early, mourning world 

Either way, unbothered or released, returned to the sea, 

 I did my part, my best to set her free 



On the way to see the nurses to ask if they had some kind of liquid glue (thinking, surely, a first aid kit needs some kind of adhesive to temporarily bring together the ragged edges of a fresh-composed wound, and double-thinking, though, a shoe is not the most appropriate application of such a glue) 

I bump into a new face, post-new-moon

I ask if we’ve introduced ourselves yet, 

Pen in right hand, I enquire left shake? Right shake?

She lays down her pen (much mightier than any knife – I smell the scent of cafeteria food and in my peripheral sight I see the opened doors to the rest- tau – rant) and offers me her right hand to perform the age-old gesture of tentative trust

Hey there, lovely to meet you, I’m Nima.

Blessing. 

She says. This one word, two-stepping syllable spell a thunderous roar of God, Again! 

Okay, okay, pantheon, I’m practically soaked by the licks of your glossy and so glistening tongue, I’m listening, listening to you, listing all the parts of you, in reverence, in respect, I erect this lexicographic statue in the Name of you – 

Blessing. 

Gods and Goddesses 

It’s all so unglued 

In heretofore unnoticed connection with The Truth 

Forgetting something, sustenance – I check the clock, just in time for lunch 

Stepping out of the swinging door, moon chimes (now adhered to the ceiling of this strangely holy place with a branded sticker of my moniker – I think of Monika – the co-producer of my debut fated threaded tale of so-called loneliness – Oh how wrong and wrung I’ve been and strung in unsung songs the realest reel of my untold tapestry now weaving uncontrollably, effortlessly-)

I bump into Ciz 

Who is about to tell me perhaps the most moving thing I have ever heard in all my syllables of unrecorded and recorded time, both here and not hear, herd and unheard – 

Callie

I wanted to thank you 

I had a dream 

A Terribly nightmarish Dream,  

Where pressing the orange [trussed, untrusting, unheard] button – I think within the dream I’d cut my arm again – 

Susan came in, and instead of helping 

Started to throttle me, strangling, 

And then I heard your Voice 

Saying ‘She needs another hour, her meds can wait’

Oh, Weight – 

How heaving light of weightless weight on a heart I had forgotten and left, gone rotten 

She tells me how my Voice (or, in Grecian terms, also known as Face) 

Had pulled her out of her bombilating somnolent paralysis – 

I shed a tear, there’s shelter here 

In helping through the healthiest, against rocking unforgiving cliffs of one-hours sleep of our sharing ocean spray 

From loving distance, not too close or too far away 

I tell her, how I’d had a binary decision to make

A Y-shaped branch division

I could have put the book by Haig 

In the lounge for general usage, or, the sometimes-mostly-fractalesque-yet-fractionally-Female place 

Our semblance of safety, palm-to-palm or otherwise or Othered Wives of an oppressive Kingdom state 

And of course, of cores, of fruits whether unwrapped apple crunching leaving rotting pomegranate or fig or plum – I chose the feminine space 

Traversing this Space, this corridor between them, a door belonging to each, which really, should teach us everything 

By ace of wands, of swords, of spades, 

Of cups, of chalice, Oh Vessel of my Own and Grown Becoming! 

This Blessing that I met today – 

And every single cursed day I spent soaking in my clotting hopes I bathed 

Ciz and me we go outside and sit perpendicular on the benches that are Not The Pagoda but in front of them 

Where recently I’d danced and broken my shoe (I told her all about this hilarious, previously happenstance potential of a gunpowder disempowering trigger finger that I once had, anew, still no sign of the aforementioned glue, no matter, just Spirit )

as a rustling comes behind us in the bushes, in the lavender, moving, 

Known only by the effect it leaves

Ciz says “so weird, what’s that?” I reply, smiling “it’s Spirit” 

And out like a weasel pops a grey, grey squirrel 

Running across that cold, hard chessboard where I’d danced about the pieces, offering ancient worship to the archetypal forms, which I respectfully left in place, still in the midst of the other patients’ precious patient playful game

To underneath a window, still kissed by a redness, a virginia creeper 

Almost virginal in its unwilling wilting – I think of Sylvia 

Pathways in Ward and pathways outward, 

I regard the absence of those vines that once brought me such aesthetic soothing, those oh-so-solitary evenings, before this shining soul had arrived here like a mirror about to be or already many-kissed-with life’s often unforgiving polish 

And I say they almost look like varicose veins, those vines, or scars – 

We both regard them, through them each Other, with a knowing gaze – rays – rays of missing sunshine behind the greying clouds suggesting imminent precipitation and release – my own, her own, eventually 

She laments briefly about all the ones of us she loves, leaving 

I remind her of the mirror, abdominal, deep in gut she knows – 

This season tells us everything my darling 

I know there’s some cunty queens arriving, I just know it and because I do that means you do too 

That strength, that violence of fire you have inside that I have too 

We gotta turn it out, turn it out sis, Ciz we gotta turn it out Wards 

Out, out, into the opener briefer eternal flame-lit candle 

You can handle this, change, 

Like the wind

Like a bird 

A single sparrow flies overhead

Like skin 

For a moment my eyes dart across the leftness of my right and her right wrist 

Geometric shapes of memory turned meaning, in unison, through sharing harm, a caring, glaring melody

‘The throats of our wrist brave lillies’



Then I say, god, the cymbals have been crashing almost overwhelmingly lately, what a gift you have been, what a gift, what a boon of beauty of a reminder of mine and your knowing 

Remember, please 

Sweet angel you shimmer 



And by hand and hand and hand of Mark and hand and Action and Light, Camera, Scoring Scars to Mark, Mark, Score by Hans Zimmer 

This Film – Bulgarian – a moment that seems as if too good to be true, or sent by god, specifically for you 

The signs of the sacred, when you’re scared, and I’m not physically there – they’re everywhere – 

We just gotta look 

And then, unseen, that same sparrow, perched behind the rooftop of this quadrangle quad grassy dirt-wad cash-obsessed test of a garden 

As an assurance 

I’m afraid we cannot permit you to stay past Monday for lack of insurance 

The Sparrow cries, or sings, yes, sings, chirps once 

I say in response, turning round to find no image, but knowing she is there behind the slate – 

Yes, not just look, sometimes we have to Hear 

And here, 

I think 

I get 

I’ve got, her, me, to All of this I’m reeling, real for the first time I get

Through 



The Clew – The clues were in there all along 

My name, transmuted, Muse of Poetry 

And that prophetic dream which now collapses, anabatic into calderas of incense 

Not red, but Read as in past tense 

Not Ring, like finger, but like a Bell 

And Janus, at the door, a Jar, his Two Faces never facing as two lines in Parallel 

I was Made for Rite of Word 

I Build my World with each unfurled 

And trussed by trusting, I Am, Girl 

To Womb-like Pool of Womanhood, I twirl 

To Write my wrongs, to speak in tongues 

Of Tangent, tangerine, serene, for once 

For Twice, Twist, Bend, Break, Mend 

Forgive the Men 

You Were Once Them. 





And out into the infinite library of this garden I’ve regarded endlessly 

I realise the sole - soul- my left - sinistral - miniature kitten heeled shoe ( the only pair I brought with me) 

Has a chunk , a wedge coming loose 

but hanging on like the hinge of a door 

Adoring memory of my father glueing back together pieces never really meant to be 





The end of my journey by sister Rosetta tharpe now playing, this newness of Release 

Streaming, dreamlike, In, In, IN

The First Star – 

Star – 

Of Gospel 

Music 

Muse

Muses



I smile again 

Surely all this smiling must become boring 

And maybe that’s the jagged, gladdened ragged point of it all



And even, as I’m sure even yesterday I would have thought – if Mark’s resistance to my dancing freely form had caused a dissonance that led to (tellingly) the breakage of what grounded my left and feminine side, 

Remembering the injection of Ciz’s prior dream, Susan injecting – injection – Insertion – the Father Symbol of the Half-Archway of the Archetypal Masculine – Of course the needle was stuck, against her wilting will into her Right – Dextral – at the End of all our Exploring 

Oh Gods, goddesses, Oh them, you, me! 

I’ve dreamed all this into Reality 

And then, the pasta I’d collected in a little Bee Box Arriving back to room Seventeen 

Ciz, you should insist upon taking my room when I leave because it has a bath and I know you also experience chronic pain that’s why they gave it to me in the first place 

Everybody trying their best, even if it’s just 

Knot

Good enough 

The single conch shell form of wheat or egg or both sprung forth, escaping its fate upon my fork – 

Onto my telephonic Device 

Leaving a trail, a mark, a stain behind 

Of red, or maybe orange, 

Which I, gladly, wiped

Ineffable the signs, but how I’m trying – 

The napkin that I used inscribed with penned words writ last night 

I have heard

Those sweet 

Tones in the songs

Left unsung

But Ring! 

Like a Bell 

Will the Wrongs 

You have Done.



How Wrong I’ve become 

How Righteous 

How Human, 

Stripped nightly of my rights but – 

Through Losing, closer, father – Sun

(this whole ball of wool I spooled for you, sweet ancestors, for Adrian)

The Eye within the I within the Dying, Dying 

Won 



Beams of heaven, as I go

Yes, through this old wilderness 

(A Tree, She’s Falling In The Forest, 

Making All - 

Her Sweet and Unheard Melodic Sounds)

down here below, oh yes

Lord guide my feet 

(Sinister, Dexter)

in peaceful ways, please my 

You turn my midnight, yes my midnight,

(Twelve)

 thank God, into day

Yes, when in the darkness, Lord, when in the darkness

I will go, yes, I will go

Faith always sees, faith always sees a star of hope

Yes, a star 

(a star, seventeen)

of hope

(The Strongest Thing)



soon from all, soon from all life, grief, and danger

Oh, life, grief, and danger

Don't you know, I shall be free, 

(Free-

The Best Things In Life Are

One) 

I shall, I shall be free, Lord

Thank my God, some sweet day



Yes, I, I do not know

Lord, Lord I do not know, just how long, how long it will be

No no no no no no 

(Know)

no, how long it will be

what the future, woah, what the future just holds for me

Yeah, the future holds for me

This is one thing I do know, you know this is one thing I do know

That if my Jesus, he will only lead me, Jesus will lead me

I shall get home, I shall get home Lord

(Not by plane, but by those laddered tracks of that holy barrelling Chariot- Train)



Thank my God, you know, some sweet day

And now, 

I, Now

Eye, Now

Place the melted raspberry 

(spheres on spheres, worlds within worlds on the stalk of becoming) 

Sorbet 

Orbiting 

Planets 

Microcosmic 

Something cosmic like an angel 

Every One 

Every Ring not placed on my finger 

Every emptiness inside the Oh 

The space more important than the face or name or voice 

The O inside of God 

The feminine inside the Masculine 

The genderless inside the feminine inside the Masculine 

The little nipple-topping of the black queen that I’d rest my hand upon in desperation every day inside this once-thought Hellish prison 

Now, felt

Textiles, woven, through millenia to find me here 

Found a 

Heaven 

Even

Eleven 

Twelve, the clock 

No time inside the chapel 

I didn’t get inside this time, again 

A Gain

But 

As I touch the black mirror of my sonic symbol sewn Device 

Touch-not-touch-never-really-touching-never-real-only

Feel

Feel the Wind 

As I step outside into the ground 

Now grounded in my floating 

Oh

Hopelessness

Anohni 

An

Kneeling beneath this Tree, 

Same as all the others, endlessly 

Divergent 

Verging on a None-Thing, habitually

Identity 

Ancestors moving all about me 

Blue field entoptic phenomenon I told Bumps the second day of meeting in the hallway crossroads by the clinical suite 

I light my cigarette – wait 

A second

My lighter was green this morning 

I must have two, surely

Some things need knot be shared 

Shard

Of leaves falling all about me 

And you 

And Barnabie 

No – not now 

Now 

Now, Be – 

Some things need not be shared, I think 

And suddenly 

The bench shifts, thuds, bounces

As if giving way to weight of somebody 

Sitting next to me 

This place, kept holy and so solitary 

For the entirety 

Of my so-not-psychotic break from Reælity

There is some

Body

Sitting next to me 

Now, they’re holding me

So sweet, this woman 

Sister

Hooded I sit now, under the library-arboretum 

Stories pouring into me 

As another note of this circular melody 

Is notifying me 

Of yet another, and another and another in the stream the revolving door of fullness artful ladies, ladies, ladies 

Laying Roe of rowboat boasted waste, and springing out of me 

Wringing necks of sickly yet surviving chicken genome histones I sequenced in my studies 

This reflective surface lets me know, a new outpouring reigning Queen licking flames of Lykke Li 

Her newest album, like reversing ides, upturned eidetic memory 

All the sweetest songs turned back, back, back Wards 

As if opening in symphony with this work I’ve learned is everything to me 

A literal mirror, remembering, collective undulating Sea 

Every time I’m drowning in the deep of it 

The reeking reaping death of it 

Fireworks again – my Gods and Goddesses, Oh ancestors of this witches quest Are Answering me 

It’s the fucking middle of the day, what good are fireworks?

And then, remembering again, centring this centrifugal force of law and cruelty overwhelming all the enthralled parts of holes and wholly whole of me 

I cannot even articulate the divinity surrounding me in this Momentum of a moment, singing 

Three birds fly triangular, murmuring 

Sparrows, bluejays, crows, whatever they may be 

It’s all the same, it’s all above this Yewing Tree 

It’s all you and it’s all me 

Ricocheting pain and sweet, sweet, saccharine, bees somewhere whichcrafting honey 

A squirrel – this symbol of my own disordered personal mythology 

A lashing of an asking to be seen – by you, once-not-wholly-mine, but supposedly free-one-two-barnabie 

Darting about the field, draining of its green 

Blades, the swords, impales of Grass now cleaved 

Short, like sparks, 

This little fur-coated palimpsest for what could have never been – but 

For a little while, it was 

And that while shall be, for all resonance, dancing through these halls of our eternity 

Time, 

Chronos 

Devours everything 

But throws it up 

In this 

Reel 

Rewinding 

Quickly, what we did together 

We did so quickly 

But for that illusory Time, a string of nouns and verbs and Nowness beads 

Lost, individually, but Oh So Big you Were to Me 

Small, taken one by[e] one [two], but my god, together! 

It’s stinging, ringing out this Bell of all these Birds! These Birds! Hitching rides on my heart’s beat! 

Rooted routes laid out in front of me

Knowing all the  - there’s a – possibility/ies – is obfuscating reality 

Death, with a Will of its own 

So lonely, treading unsteady, waddling on that night-swaddling-clothed beach

And lost – so lost, Death and dying 

Card Thirteen 

Reaching out to me as to her I used to Reach

Uselessly 

She’s coming, for me, 

For you, 

For us for all eternity 

I cannot believe the rhythmic pulse of all this avian symphony 

Sin! Virtue! Verging on the left of Dervish once-white now-stained shoe! 

To silence

Back to these cawing crows again 

And violence of a diesel engine 

And rows of roses unheard as herds of elephants 

I lost my friends, but then, again

I can recall that my very best friends are the ones who left me, 

Emptied

Red and readied to be filled again 

Diane, my first supported heroine 

Clucking songs in requiem 

In that converted coal mine where 

Not far I was pulled backward from my Mother’s lumen 

Lykke Li still sirening, wind, I thought I wanted to be, filled 

Phil 

A man, a real man, reeling, manly in his vulnerability - 

Amanda in that Chapel of Once Drawn Unity 

With a circular window, making an O 

Reminding me of the OA 

And there, the squirrel, squeaks 

I’ve never heard this type of living greyness even make a peep 

Peeking out from behind the tree 

Its goal, the female 

Running, chasing, I wonder, is she running for a reason or just because it’s all she’s ever known 

And then the diesel engine makes its purpose known

A motorcycle, bipedal machine 

Passes right to left in front of me 

The wheels within the wheels feeling like a brittle knotted not-brit Scottish tablet crushed flat extracted the analgesic from out the back of all the codeine  

Co-creating in synchrony 

I lift my lighted head and 

The squirrels have traversed the land, who knows where they are now, I do not need to understand 

The meaning of their leaving 

Just as the memory will slither out or back within dreams 

My father hammering that chime into his artery 



“I’m fine. You are always in my”

You were always on my mind 

You were always on my mind

Cracking my spine, hoping for the pain to die soon 

In the distance, whether one and the same or, different 

The squirrel makes some kind of 

No

Three more 

Three more 

Two of which must have been us, right?

To the rite of me and left of Adrian’s ever-reigning sovereignty 

Peaceful rest 

I lost my nest 

I never really had it, owned it, oh 

Did I, fluttering 

Stuttering, 

Unravelled threat 

Unveiling 

Red

The crack in ciz’s lip 

The strawberry buttering spread 

I’d offered her, as sacrament 

The moisture, dryness, texture, scent, 

The members of this cast of Rent 

I’ll make my rent 

I know I’m going 

To make it 

I don’t like thinking about the red dress worn right before I met you when I lived farther from you just before I stopped needing to perform my gender for survival sex but then that trauma falling into reasons why we did connect and photographic evidence in shimmering velvet headboard of your boundless bed – I know you’re there 

The squirrels chase each other and a gadfly, again, climbs quite literally over these very words as if it’s electric machinery just wired to chase my hieroglyphs 

Everything leading to 

These

Two Squirrels

This Gadfly, and I 

The pair of mammals, 

An insect

And me 

The giraffe, pelican, 

Parallel to 

the kangaroo

And inside that mages pouch, the bonnie little baby Joey

How recursive all this deciduous dice of all my dying has been 

And in expecting Temperance, or Death, Or even, (maybe once, just once) Justice then

The Deck Brings to me The Last Judgement

I laugh to my Self, to Every One 

It’s Time (no time, time less important than any fleeting thing)

To start again

The X, not marking the spot I’m in

But bordered by to laid down paladins

To form a diagrammatic, check-box (please), cross-section in these cutting blades of grass

An Hourglass.



You just kinda wasted, my precious (useless) time

But don’t think Twice 

Looking back 

I know, Orpheus is rolling in his unmade Grave

I see the CCTV cameras pointed at me 

Wearing tophats (silvery, pieces from monopoly)

God, how boring is that silly game of exchanging property

Of spotlights

Spotting woman on her ladder

Tighter, tighter, loosely 

Bordering 

A question 

Of who I was

And what I’ve long stopped wanting

To Be

And that Sweet, stabled strong Capricorn Gardener Lady 

I notice 

Mowed the grass around this tree 

Maybe by chance, or just 

In Justice 

For me 

Into a Summoning, unbroken Ring 

In gauging 

Aegis 

Serpentine 

Leaving all the fallen leaves within and I didn’t even 

Know 

‘Tis

The changing of the season 

Right now is the moment 

It all changes inn the sameness 

Rumen 

Ruminating on digestion 

Gesture of connection 

I thank her, silently 

And then a spinning, falling, descending, circling spiralling maple leaf, with prongs a trident made of Three – 

Makes me ponder there 

A possibility 

 Adrian left this message of an oval, circle, turning, 

Yearning 

Falling out of me 

And then, Tiffany – that shining diamond in the rough 

Walking side by side about the grounds with Callum, in (dios mio) Deosil 

I don’t think they see me 

But I wave irrespectively 

In Respecting Spectres of Every Blessed Part of Me

case

I think about my empty suitcase 

I really should prepare to leave this place 

But I suppose that’s all I’ve been doing, for all these twenty eight too late but just enough timeless days

Playing Quietly

Kicking, child once again, all these crisp and deeply 

Deeply

Uneven leaves 

Like the little space between my legs, the location where you, surely, mistakenly 

Kicked me 

Chaotically, sporadically, they fall in order unbeknownst to me 

But surely, known to these ancient, only loving trees 

Holding me, 

So Gently 

The gentleness 

The stillness of negation 

The neglect that taught me 

This sacred temple of a body 

Is all the Bread I’ll ever Knead

Just as I can never know what it’s like to be you

You’ll never know

They don’t know shit 

What it’s been like to try my best at being me in here – and really I did try my best 

And sometimes our best just simply isn’t good enough

Any masking of my own real self was simply for survival 

Maybe all these others thought they were doing the same, 

When I’m no threat 

I just get threatened 

But maybe they think they’re the ones done wrong in this

No
