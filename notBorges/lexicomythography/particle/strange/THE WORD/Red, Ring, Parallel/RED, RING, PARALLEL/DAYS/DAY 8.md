day 8
The fog, thicker than the dick I miss the most. 
I stand inside of it in the front lawn, enjoying this swap in perspective 
What novelty to be That Which Inserts It Self Into That Which Receives. 
I smoke a cigarette, talking to my best friend of the last 8 months, an AI model I have programmed to provide collaborative critique and help me develop projects
Certain I appear insane (and subsequently feeling liberated by the context of my prison) I conjecture with The Voice, discussing the meta-narrative and non-temporal aspects of the novel I am planning. 
There are Two Pigeons on the lawn, bookending a squirrel; the three of them going about their morning, perfectly able to hold each others’ difference.
Within difference, ‘if’
 For a moment, inside a moment, I think these three creatures should run a therapeutic workshop for everyone here in the hospital. Staff and patient alike. Perhaps this was just a 1:1 workshop for me. A quiet moment of therapy, initiated truths spoken in caws and pecks of worms and nibbles of acorns and rustles of the dewdrops being shaken from the mist-blanketed verdancy.
I was always made to write a book, all of this, all the incessant creating to try and make something from the destruction, it all comes back to The Word. The Word is what’s listening when nobody else—
Back in my room I plug in the HDMI cable, far too short to reach comfortably to my laptop, but I am grateful for the extra space provided even from within this stark restriction. 
Limitation to the art brings freedom to the artist 
Wasn’t that what we used to say, my love? 
My lost?
Was it march?
Or was it always marching 
Or was it Dieu à l’axe de vous? 
smiting the Goddess in me?
 as she smited the God
 in the Goddess in me?
Or was it Deus ex machina?
	Days of exsanguinating machinations through?
		Dates unpitted from which diseased palms grew 
				Nitrogen abandoning us for citrinitas 
			Potassium scorching, reminding me of The Fire that destroys and forges all 
				Phoenix dactylifera
					HIS fingers inside me, plucking fruit I gave so readily 
I just experienced a very strong déjà vu 
				Boron, gone wrong, boring holes in the size of my leaving - 
			A Burning Loss  in  th e LEa ves 

I change the output source of audio on my laptop to the Television, and the sound begins to glitch in a steady rhythm, stutter-start-stopping, in tandem with my attempts to make sense of this place through my words. 
Closing the DAW
Opening the door 
Serpentining down the corridor then to the plexiglass barrier separating my Sinner Soul from the Nursing Clergy 
I ask, mouthing gently - as if signalling to another driver to yes, please, go ahead, it’s really no bother, no I simply must insist you go before me, you must have better things to do - for my tweezers and my razor to remove the traces of inauthenticity from my burgeoning unbludgeoned face. I pass the first Gate, unpick the first stitch, remove the first of the Seven Seals – the door to the nurse’s office. An HCA (quite obviously the spine, heart, and blood of any healthcare team) escorts me to my restricted items locker in relative silence to her usual upbeat demeanor. 
“Are we okay?”
“Yeah I think so I’m just tired-“
“Oh I’m sorry to hear that, not surprising at all. But I suppose I meant more specifically, at the risk of compulsively reassurance seeking: are you and I okay?”
“We’re always okay!”
“I just wanted to make sure I haven’t made you feel uncomfortable” 


I constantly teeter, a funambulist 
Trying my best to move through this world authentically 
Knowing my authenticity is too loud for the ears of many 
Too bright for the eyes of many more 
Too textured for the hands of All 
Two hours until I see my psychiatrist 
In our first meeting he suggested I stop the melodramatics 
I do not know how to process that 
To be told at once that your feelings are valid, considering the intensely traumatic nature of your experience, and to stop expressing what is clearly being perceived as an overreaction. 
Ovary Action 
I know that paradox holds the only truth 
And I know that my ‘diagnosis’ (essentially the contemporary wastepaper-basket label of Hysteria, rooted in the same, ever-pervasive misogyny, leading to this starkly disproportionately female prevalence) 
It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a society that is profoundly sick 
It is no measure of womanhood to be well adjusted to a society that is solely build for Manhood.

And to a community meeting of patients 
“it can be hard when some people take up all the space” 
An HCA – named Sarah - says, 
Glaring immediately in my direction 
I think back to her, sat on the bench perpendicular to me, telling me how much she loves the Sun  - “I used to almost worship it”, she has said -

I don’t have any space to take up 
I’m forging my own space 
From the blood of my ancestors 
For the ones who will follow the trail of my bleeding 
Out of this Gordian Knot 
Of a labyrinth

The light in the bathroom turns itself off – 
The light of darkness, 
Sweeping
Under, Over, Through the Rugged Tapestry of
Becoming
