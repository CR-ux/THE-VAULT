day 2
11.10.24
My calligraphic pen has mysteriously gone missing
First crossing of the sacred threshold
Recording of the sacred stain
Dissonance in discovery of our tape loop harmony preserved never ending in the past repeating repeating
*SQUIRREL AS A SYMBOL FOR YOU*


**NIGHT TWO**
It is quite obvious
With every huff and sigh
Of every member of uncertain staff
Stumbling over my gender
A lifetime in the forging, obliterated, in the I in the blink of the eye
Reacting to my smile with a scoul
It is quite obvious that this is simply a microcosm reflecting the macrocosm
I donâ€™t know what I expected
Perhaps, in such a place of vulnerability
Perhaps, an equivalency of compassion
An equivalency of
What?
Whatever I give
Whatever I give that has never been returned
A tiny spider crawls over my leg
I welcome her
I thank her for knowing better than any human here
How to traverse the unique terrain
Of the saltmines of my remaindered body
And together we weave our blanket
Purposely leaving drop stitch after drop stitch
As clews through this pristine and filthy labyrinth
The flaw through which we may escape
Whatever great new Minotaur is waiting
