day 6
H.W. Half-Waking, Hemming-Way, a Has been Washer Woman and the Sea, swept away to rupture
rapt by sleep paralysis 
HE stands in the corner of the room – this is where HE lives. 
Stifled groaned escaping my semi-conscious mouth
Unable to reach the call button for help 
H. W.Hartley’s Wave or Hemiola Weight or Hake Waltz or Hocket Wake
I knew that my life’s little story
would be aboard a sinking ship
That amidst within and with the din my duty
To blanket and to cover it
The doubling basis of my ankle
My spinning screwing inanimation of an ache, a body
Of a waiting heaviness yet emptied and too gossamer anchor facsimile
In lieu of my own throat’s doting with caressing kisses
a sturdy neck of oak and strings
A reaching beech to choke and wring
A squeaking, squeezing, heaving thing
And in this fretless fretting, indebted existence
The sodden lot I was begot from: resonance
A Salt alloy anointing knuckles white cold flood
All bleeding buckling thunderous evil needle pointed drain
This disordered Form waterborn, employed to be
no more understood
Than the lightning clap of rapture of collapsing entropy,
of dying sound, of sigh, goodbying
wave
With close to floating
Captive crest of hope
Sewn through loneliness of awe, the audience ;
all I’d ever be was resonance
All I have is resonance
I am employed aboard this requieming vessel
My own empty hollowness of buoyancy to settle
My role and soul to fold contained within
waxed pages waning all their staying refrain
restrained in place by aluminium pegs and flimsy single-legged trestle
Through dampened dregs, backgrounded wreckage
Under undeciphered steganographic message
Unapplauded firing rounding soundtrack announcing quietly the vestige:
What unknown coda
To the seeing
Breathing beaten
symphony
Reverberated through this fraying air
Before me?
Hear!
To hear is all
that’s here with me
Unnoticed in the going
Such loss
so long
forgotten to the drossing oscillation
And I can’t or know not what
Could stop or decay this doubtless dedication
My droplet in distress a signal
Rafted by notation
A daughter’s drowned out sound abound
For sureness shore
cut short her hurt
never to be circumnavigated back
to her father
again but rather
(When this sinking isness
Revealed itself to be the fulcrum which
the voyages compasses circled about)
To play us out of this disgraceful maze
To not displace a living thing
To swallow vice of hollowness
To perform a life in divisive flotation
To play out in light, defiance
To score the lore of others’ dance
To bear the plague of grateful cadence
To play us all out
the doomed to love, the hate-filled devout
For another fresh faced bass
To take my saline-fated place
Decrescendoing
The bowing
Bone
slowing track
Tone
flowing,
A lone line, slack
but unabated
weighted
braying
for home
to be taken home
In the going back
To the great and knowing
ocean
I dream of chalk 
I dream of blood red chalk on wallpaper
