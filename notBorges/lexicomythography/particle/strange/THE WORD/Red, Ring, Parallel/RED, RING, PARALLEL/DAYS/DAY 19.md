DAY NINETEEN
The day of the Sun
Everything contains its opposite 
And words contain the answers
The answers are not coming 
Because
They were already her
E
Illumination 
Lumen 
Light as wisdom 
An opening 
A cavity
The aqueduct
The narrow Passage Through
There’s a crack in everything, that’s how the 
Female
Fe(male)
The masculine within the feminine
The ferrous substance guarding him
The blood 
The womb
The uterus 
Utero 
You, terror, my teacher 
Reaching, heavenward
Ward, Garden, Walled, A warning – 
Yelling at the ripping
Paper covering
Thinning veil
Yellowing
Walling paper
Othering
Mothers 
Little, and the cosmic scale
Grandeur and miniature 
Minotaur 
Half Brother
Half Sister
Halved, becoming whole again
But never ever
Really getting 
There
Here
Her
E
The stick in the middle of the E 
Unsplittable 
Septum
Septa
Seven
Plus 
Twelve 
Nineteen 
With the blinded Sun 
We 
Rise 

My Encounters with the Divine 
This is an archival documentation 
With the divine 
Through
The shield of my
Device
Device 
At home, I use this device 
As a means to archive the divine 
I listen to the birds 
Record
Homographic
Record 
Holographic
Device 
Creating lasting testament 
Isn’t Recording almost Eerie?
Truly a time machine?
Capturing something, sliced in time 
Something that would otherwise be lost 
And then opening a portal 
To listen to the past 
Technology interfaces the ineffable 
The divine 
Allowing the Truth 
These terrifying moments
That otherwise, fleeting
Vulnerable experiences 
Silenced, Gossamer 
This portal 
This portal to my past 
Reclaims my Body 
My
Protection 
These two Stereo microphones 
Pointed 
In an X 
Or lemniscate figure
Skating, Skid
Mark
King 
The Spot 
And Here
She 
Demands her existence 
I insist on Becoming 
Bound 
Aries 
Free 
Outside on the grounds I write this as I try to write this as I try to catch it like a wooden stick with a crab as bait I weight for answers upon the wettest bench I sit and look at the speed limit sign in front of me encircled by a red ring with the Divine number inside and think
No, not Ten 
Not even One and Zero 
But I/O 
The white against the red 
The blood against the bandage 
The Martinitsa 
In the midst of Autumn 
Awe-struck, I implore the Fall 
To Keep me in its Falling and there – 
I am held 
In my letting go 
In my Leaving 
On the trip to the corner shop, my one little shredded strip of autonomy 
I find  upon a bin a sticker 
Two red lines, 
And a Word 
It Read, in red: 
‘OPEN’
And in the middle of this symbol
A Cymbal 
Circle 
A Red, Red Ring 
[IMG]
I smile as Phil Sings to me 
Songs about a new World coming –




I walk past Paul (in Salmon Shirt)
The Bearer of Good News 
I Walk past Susan (not in Salmon, but in Paisley)
I stand tall and tell The Ward
Man
Ager (Not in Salmon, but in Navy) 
Who finally listened 
and bought scrabble for this prison
and say 
First step scrabble
Next step
Competent night and weekend staff
Mel arrives at the Clinic
I ask her what songs of celebration we are singing this morning 
She says Well, I’ve been thinking about honey 
Ah, the nectar of the Gods 
I think about the Bee that we freed last night 
The words crossing, intersecting 
Like honeycomb
Then Sarah walks past with her breakfast and her freshly washed hair (dressed in some washed out pink)
Looking Lighter somehow 
A light was found in darkness here 
In reply to my request to know her state 
Memoryless 
She holds up her little box of pancakes in the right 
And down in her left are three small plastic pots of Honey 
We all smile at one another 
As Nurse Tina (dressed in Salmon, we discuss the strength and symbol of resilience, encapsulated in this great Omega Colour) 
She says how clever they must be, to return back to the place from whence they came – 
I say, could there be a better metaphor for Spirit?
The Veil is thinning, approaching, Truth 
The Truth, this Setting 
Like the whitest paint upon a doorway 
Entering Illumination 
Through Looming Lumen Will What’s Done 
Be Brought To Light Through Meaning. 
And my Device, my Recorded Requiem 
The Key, ensuring the reliability 
Of my narration. 
And this, as my consultant said to me the night prior 
Is Sobering. 
Sobering. 
The perfect choice of words 
For the mold and filth and fuzziness enslurred 
By the inadequacy of This White Palace 
I walk past another dressed in Salmon 
And another
And another 
Returning to the Home I thought I’d forgot 
For
Got
A Forge
No Forgery 
An Ogre under the Longest Bridge 
A Bridge 
A Chess Match 
Matches

An Arsenal 
An Artery 
The Art of Opening 
The Heart 
To Hear 
Here - 
Her
Listening

In The Pagoda
He Arrives
Asking 
Why it is I think he’s transphobic
I take a second 
Breathe 
Rebuild my Rook of protection 
He tries to twist his words and I say 
 you Threatened Me
I have it on Record 
He says well you know that’s against All Sorts of Things 
I stand, resolved and say, 
No, No it’s not.
(Knowing that the Recorder was not turned on at all)
Take off my Sunglasses
Be The Sun 
Look him Straight in the Eye 
And say 
Bound
Aries 
We Both Sit Across from one another 
I kneel before him 
He starts talking about Coventry 
The Plaice where I am From 
And the War 
In the Walls of this Warring Garden
Trying to say that he is the greatest ally of the Women in Here 
I stifle a stuttered laugh 
You cannot get through to me, honey 
He asks me to stop calling him honey 
I say, do you realise how much you call us women sweetheart, darling, 
Touch us without consent 
He says I need to calm down 
I’m very calm I say, my gaze not faltering 
Neither of us are people we want to mess with 
So let’s agree 
Said the sun 
That He is Stronger 
Who Strips That Traveler
Of His Cloak. 
I ask to shake his hand
I ask
He says Well I don’t want to because then I’ll be accused of touching you inappropriately 
I say
No, Mark. 
I asked to shake your hand 
And then, as our hands come together 
(But of course, not together, because nothing ever really touches) 
He still, 
Still
Manages to make my skin crawl in saying: 
I’d prefer a cuddle 
And I think:
Well, at least I tried.
And Keep Trying I Will. 
Nevertheless, She Will Persist 
And this scared little man can’t handle 
Hand 
By Hand and hand and hand and everything 
An outstretched hand 
In welcoming, welcoming 
Goodbye to all that was never meant to touch me. 
How beautiful, the Autumn 
How sweet the scent of rotting leaves 
Rotting everything away 
Between this fearful, feared little shaken man 
Still sits the White King, Still. 
Impaled by Reddest Ping Pong Paddle 
Parallel 
Singing:
You Cannot Mess With Me. 
Stuffed with Mulch and Fungus 
Shoved into the Hole, the Hollow
This Unholy Place of Blood and Rot
Into the Hollow where I Slot 
The Ergot- 
Rot 
That Shall Not Ever Be 
For
Got.

It is a session on understanding Low Mood

My notes as follows:

Next to Leave, 
Louise – 
I see her in the Corridors well-trodden 
And in meeting, and in parallel I say 
I must give back your materials 
(She leant me such beautiful oils and pigments) 
Watercolour from the water-meadow 
Oil and pigment from the Maestra, born in Cancer 
I take down the double-sided hanging
I’d been placing as a shield upon my Door 
Covering the number seventeen
And in small scrawl, just for her I write in the sinistral corner 
“Maestra Lucy – 
Whether blinded by illumination of The Sun 
Or Overwhelmed by the tidal pull of The Moon
The Crab, in cunning, knows how to protect herself 
This side-stepping courage, not a curse or burden 
But a Boon 
I Love You Always 
Nima”


The Sun of this day won’t stop shining.
The illumination is absolutely stunning, into silence 
Into tapestry after thread after red thread of fated cooing incidents

Raised voices sat upon the Bench
Right next to where the Dove is Buried
I send her all my energy

I tear in half this Parchment

The Cards Are Showing me 
That Everything Must Contain its opposite 
The Male Within the FeMale 
Held 
The Elder in the Child 
Knowing in Unknowing 
And Bobo, the Loving Labrador Retriever 
Retrieving Sticks and Stones I Thought I’d thrown Away 
Thrown Back as Boomerangs 
Booming, Looming Clouds that Clang and Clatter, 
Matter, 
The Gates Of Matter 
Shattering 
I ask the Gardener upon the Grounds 
The Birthday of Her Dog 
(The Bobo of whom I spake) 
Everyone seems so afraid 
Of Me 
How telling 
Authenticity 
So often misperceived 
I think of my third turn 
In my earlier unfinished Match 
A Candle, Still
 lit, glowing 
Going Down, descending, aptly Katabatic 
“FAKE” 
A reasonable score, 
But Hand, by hand, by handicap 
The Balance is what matters more – 
And October Third

Both Bobo and My Greatest Love 
My Greatest Loss

The Scale, it screeches, Breaking me

A Parcel 
A Part 
Of my Childhood arriving unto me 
My Mother Sent 
Candles, taken from me – 
Not allowed upon the Ward 
Ward – a separate room in a hospital, one allocated to a particular type of patient – 
Patience 
Ward – to guard; protect 
I think of my Father, the locksmith - 
farther, 
Closer by distance to me now than in the last seven years 
Further than he’s ever been 
Ward – any of the internal ridges or bars in a lock that prevent the turning of any key which does not have grooves of corresponding form or size. 
I think of the Jigsaw in the general lounge 
We’re Going On A Bear Hunt 
Hunting for 
Pieces
That simply will not Fit
How
Fitting
Ward – the action of keeping a lookout for danger 
Old English – Weardian – to keep safe, protect, watch over
Watch

Death, or Growing Up 
(Gore, the Bulgarian rope, Martinitsa, Blood and Bandages, Red Ring Parallel with Strings of White)

The Ward, Snatched 
Chasing back

Death is not a passive Truth 
But an active, evolving presence of its own 
For Them I Have Become Death 
A Fearful Truth that comes too soon
And through, and through, and through and through and through the glossy pages 
Laying Waste to resolution

And then there came a tapping 
Amidst Nightmarish, Wakeful Napping 
Interrupting my eruption ticking of non-fictional Lore 
So many things lost in the deluge 
How strangely they behold the Light 
How Oft the Light of Truth Be Cast as Darkness
Something, Shifted

Willingly 
Claire Comes in and shows me her injury that she’d apparently been asking for medical attention regarding all day. I say to her:
“you have to keep asking, it’s such a shame, such an injustice and a miscarriage of care that you’ve been suffering all day. Have you asked again?”
“No, I’m not very good at that.”
This is when I realise. 
I’ve become a vessel, or a conduit or something. I’ve become the one that people come to when they are too afraid to be painted as the Bad Guy. 
I Thought You Were A Good Guy.
Well, 
Not anymore. 
I allow the silence to ring out, my face still reflecting the very real empathy I feel for this woman, but I simply cannot afford for my Body to feel this pain anymore. I tell her we all must fight our own fight. I ask her if she’s had her medication yet, and then Ciz comes in and (rightfully) complains about the lack of painkiller she has received. I reiterate that we all really must fight our fight, stand our ground, because we truly deserve it. Then Claire returns, asking for a part of my KitKat, and I tell her Callum has actively asked me to hand them out to everyone. So please do feel free to go take one of her own. She seems to sigh, and huff, and in reflexive submission I break the small cylindrical Sienna Bread and hand it to her. Oh that will be perfect, she says. 
She didn’t want her own one. She wanted part of mine. 
None of these people want or maybe none of these people can own their own needs and desires. And the only reason I was beginning to see this was because this has been the modality of living for the majority of my life. She then begins discussing our earlier scrabble match (of which we only played three turns, before the ‘C’ was taken, by some very much so known hand, rendering it unplayable. I didn’t let it phase me. Two nights prior I had crumbled to my knees, trying to explain that while the mothers here may miss their children, not having scrabble board here felt like my version of this ache. It was an entirely insufficient analogy, for both sides. As I tried to speak it ran away from me, gossamer, I -
Last night this wonderful young woman told me how heartbroken she was when somebody didn’t return the favour that she had given them, something about equality, balance. Justice. I saw myself in her with such clattering resonance. I realised that, for my entire life, I’ve been living as a screaming Question – echoing this unheard siren’s call throughout the universe until the last syllable of all recorded time. Simply asking to be loved the way I never was, through these desperate acts of unconscious transactional care. Unknowingly wanting, needing, passively, surpassing all thought and felt sensation, needing reciprocity. And falling, falling, down, so far down each time it was not returned in the way my ocean of subconscious sense had expected. Writing this ledger, this tally in my heart, a veritable Sagittarian Arrow singing in my stinging heart, clenching, tighter, telling me, yes, I will find my mirror if I just keep shining every iridescent wave of Light I have in me, collapse myself  into these particles of partitions and pretense and tension, contort my form into something acceptable, hopefully more than acceptable, maybe just hopefully something even perhaps – loveable
All of this an absolutely desperately outstretched hand in welcoming goodbye after goodbye after goodbye, 
Calling in the cawing of every crow bar one – 
Me. 
I never once turned the light inward, cerebral icing on this rusted iron-clad-caked goodbye cycling, intellectualizing every single emotion  - 
Energetic motion, gone unnoticed 
Threads being pulled out of me
A Rack 
Knee
Arachne 
You had so much to teach me. For years I studied the intricacies of your story, even constructed and composed a complex album cycle in your Name – you were screaming in the blackest ground of the gourd of my Being and becoming, there, in the abyss, the golden bowl, breaking, braking, screeching halting to this: I wasn’t even paying attention. I wasn’t even paying attention. My silver cord a gordian knot, not gorging on the cornucopia I’ve built in me. Why dredge and snot and slice the fruit to dry and rot in brutish hues of sunlight shining outwardly? These sections, 
Section 5, 3, 2 – 
Sections of a satsuma, sat sooner, mewing, sewn, saluting – soldiers of my own sinewing, blue veined, ruminating, I refuse it. I refuse it now. 
In the kitchen, when Callum asked me to hand out the KitKats, encouraging the breaking of the bread, by my hand – I asked him, genuinely wanting to know, sensing a gentleness I’d not felt here yet - he told me he’d been here for five weeks. He told me he was lonely. 
It was a Mirror 
A scathing Mirror, unbreakable. 
Seven Years of Just The Same Luck
I’d been pulled into this whirling devilishly 
And Mark, while I take my goodnight pills 
A stationed serendipity 
The pin of a metallic poppy, in remembrance upon his left shoulder, shone silently - 
Remember, 
Remember school, remember bullies, remember everything you never wanted to be 
The one I fought for the least, who I thought I fought against 
Slowly, knowing; 
My opponent was not my ally, but rather my reflection.
His overtly hateful Fog-like Mother 
Mine, in the past, so passively
Neglect takes many mortal forms 
And brings the braying news of Death 
Thirteen 
For some, unlucky 
But Not Lindsay 


It’s become so clear to me just how much people need me 
And use me without meaning to 
Without meaning 
But with Memory – 
I am seeing 
All the intersecting spaces, where the dance of chance takes hold of everything, becoming Being in the only thing that matters 
Now 
No Matter, 
Sound 
No Matter, 
Light 
No Matter, 
Actually 
Vibration 
Up and Down 
The rafters 
Batten 
Down 
The Hatchlings 
And keep them safe, it is out of my hand my hand my hand my hand and hand and everything now 
I need nothing now 
But the beating of the rhythm of my thrice gated four-timed chambers of my heart. 
The ball bearing, spherical 
Sapphic 
Female loving female curvature 
The planetary romance between Luna’s illumination and the Earth 
And oval 
Ovum 
Revolution 
Making space in Middling 
Unmeddling, side-stepping 
Crab 
Protected by the shell 
The spiral 
Fibonacci, flying arrow archery 
A part of me 
Got lost and then 
Came home
Came home 
Come home, Omega, 
Salmon 
Swim your little Self 
Upstream 
And realise – Callum, He, who all of them are terrified of 
Is you 
The Bear 
Hunted, Hunter, 
Hunt 
More than 
Moon 
More than 
Sun 
More than even force of gravity between them 


Space.
