DAY NINE 
A nurse, (Susan - one of my favourite people here, compliments me on my charm necklace, adorned with amethyst, an inverted crucifix, a hamsa, a spider, a crown of thorns, and a crow’s claw clutching another amethyst, but this one in the shape of a perfect sphere. 
“Thank you. I drew down the moon into it. Nobody can touch me now.” 
“I love that” she says, though with a very uncertain, perturbed look on her face. 
As I turn to walk away, I am called back 
Colin, my toy bear, has arrived in the post 
I struggle to tear open the packaging and burst into tears as I see his familiar fur peeking under the plastic, like revealing an ancient secret of love only I could ever know 
I crumble to the four steps that lead from the clinical suite (where we all line up at 9pm for our nightly medication) grappling with the double layered shopping bags that are keep me from the softness of my most trusted friend, inanimate – but that’s okay. My heart does enough moving for the both of us
Suddenly, agony shoots through the centre of my spine, as if the necklace itself was thousands of degrees and burning through my skin into the depths of my spinal cord 
Someone wishing me ill 
I know someone was wishing me ill in that moment 
I know it 
I stumble back to my room after being observed in opening my package (to ensure nothing hidden I could hurt myself with inside the package) 
I know someone was wishing me ill in that moment 
I take off my necklace, it provides a temporary relief, which quickly passes 
Someone was wishing me ill in this moment 
I draw a Tarot card. Hanged man in reverse. 
The star of David on the gluteal muscle of the titular figure seemed to play a pentatonic scale and start another, leaving it unfinished. 
The tifurcated tongue of the Neptunian Trident upturned, as if shoved into the dirt ina. Futile attempt to till the earth, or provide a frame for a stupid boring game for wealthy people. 
Someone is wishing me ill in this moment 
I ask for an ice pack and an ibuprofen 
The nurse comes to my room and draws my attention to two Robins 
Neck immobilized, I turn my whole body to face the starkness of the sunshine 
Only one Robin remained, by the time I managed the painful yet so simple maneuver of my body, made to be broken, made to be misunderstood, made for dissonance, for blinding, blinding, hurting, the earth that I in Lightning was made to crack against.
“One of them just flew behind that bush”
I ask to leave to go for a walk to try to gently mobilise my spine somewhat. I am granted this brief autonomy. 
There are crunching uncertainties underfoot as my size 12 mid-height-heel pestles pulverize the mortar of the pebblestones on the short but winding road out of here. 
 I secure the ice pack kindly given to me by the nurse underneath the charm necklace, wondering if perhaps this barrier of physical sensation will provide some sort of relief from the spiritual onslaught that appears to be taking hold from an unknown, unseen (but quite reasonably and specifically suspected and estimated) force. 
I lift my noise cancelling headphones to my ears, awaiting the cushioned farewelling of the granular gravel soliloquy – 
The sound of my footsteps does cease in its kissing of my inner ear, but not due to the introduction of a barrier, however
Rather through the opening of a door 
My breathing ceases and I am alone except for the peaceful body of a pigeon, directly in the middle of my path on these pebbles, 
These pebbles which, only just then, brought back a memory of the ‘standing stones’ a punishment in my early childhood for misbehaviour, where we were forced to stand on the gravel outwith the boundary of the playground, watching our friends (if we had any) play and laugh and, in the case of some of us, taunt us as we stood there. Being forced to stay there long enough to not be able to hold my own bladder. Pissing myself in the most public and obvious spectacle possible; in the place supposed to be held most sacred to a child – pain, pain, pain garlanding play. Always. 
I kneel at the feet of this beautiful, winged soul at rest. 
I take the one piece of paper I have out of my bag. It was a script, or an invocation, or a spell, or a desperate plea for help to myself that I wrote two days prior. It read:
“i don’t know how to say no in this moment without inadvertently hurting your very valid feeelings which I hope you know I truly do care about. Right now, I am learning how to prioritise my needs so that I can regain enough strength to recover and be able to provide support appropriately and safely for us both”
in thin, thin red biro. Like varicose veins on anemic skin. 
The back of the paper, its original purpose, the Platonian Form of the paper or its cosmogonical intent, was a xeroxed sheet for recording “Treatment Goals” in which I (and nobody else, because nobody else showed up to the group) was asked to write “What might get in the way of said goals?”
I wrote one word. It had three letters. 
Men. 
As I picked up the pigeon and felt her size, her lightness, her fragile weight now devoid of breathing 
I realized the obstacle on my path was a door 
I realized the body, the dead and not-yet-decaying body, feathers splayed about her, on my path, trodden by so many troubled souls just this morning, 
Was not an obstacle, but a door 
The men I am so afraid of, 
The fearful things they have done from me through nothing but fear itself 
Not an obstacle, but 
The Only Door 
Through any of this. 
I gingerly wobble my way through thick patches of intertwined thornbushes, the place the Robin had flown out of sight to a mere few minutes ago, and find a small natural pyramid structure that had formed from roots of nearby trees and these strong, strong thorns, so assertive in their sharpness, almost tripping me, shard their way into my ankle and form the shape of what looks like a Trident, or third numeral, or mirror-flipped-reversed fifth glyph ‘E’: 

I place her in this emptiness, gathering leaves from under a nearby sapling, who seems to have offered them to the bird as a final comfort blanket, so that she might not feel cold ever again.
“Rest Well Sweet One” 
I continue my walk 
The ice pack falls from my neck 
I bend down again to pick it up, and in my re-ascent catch the eyes of two crows, 
I am not sure, in their bifocal modality, whether they were regarding each other, or regarding me, or both at once
The three of us stood there a moment, as if acknowledging that a Life was Laid to Rest here. 
A Life Was Laid To Rest Here. 
And they whispered things to me, things I cannot share as I do not yet have the language to do so 

Crying has always been part of who I am at the peeling onion of my core 
 I am realizing the deluge of tears is undammed not by danger 
But by safety 
Endless neglect has led to a state in which 
Safety is unknown 
Danger is familiarity 
And so somehow Danger has become safety 
And any act of kindness, care or compassion directed toward me 
Causes a deep sadness 
Because it draws attention to the decades of neglect
But this means the tears are a beacon 
Telling me I am being cared for 
Telling me I am on the right track 
And to never 
Accept 
Danger 
And all its familiarity 
Again 
 I used to cry when somebody saw me 
For who I really was 
My first memory of tears is my mother screaming 
ARE YOU GAY?
Uncontrollable exanthema in saline – 
That feeling which would follow me for the rest of my life 
Leaving slugtrails of dry skin from my lashes, caressing the underside of my then-smooth, then rough, then-raw-then-back-to-almost-smooth again skin of my jaw and chin and dew dropping tracheal apple in concave, convex, back to concave but this time with darkness of scar tissue eclipse like a moon I’d been carrying, carrying in my throat, eclipsing itself out of survival.

I steal a quiet moment in the sunshine 
I hold Goethe’s Faust in my left hand and an unlit cigarette in my right 
Beneath the umbrella of the berry tree, fruits reddened from their whiteness, 
I see him approaching 
I take a breath, reminding myself I am safe 
Reminding myself of the mantra 
In Sanskrit:
Man – to think – to believe – to imagine 
Tra – Tool or instrument 
In Indo-European:
Greek “Menos” – mind – spirit – intent – endure – remain - stay.
Latin “Mens” – mind – “Meminisse” – to remember – “Monere” – to instruct, advise. 
English “Man” – human. “Meaning”. 
Mantra the root – Meaning, memory, believing in remaining, staying in the remains of memory.
The proto-Germanic:
Mainizjan
These roots of these flowers bloom in my mind, temporarily suspending my brain’s scratching at the door of the thought of leaving, quickly now, leave-
I remain seated and allow him to approach 
He asks for a cigarette and I realise I have not brought my tobacco with me
“I’ll just pop inside for two minutes to get it, and meet you out here?”
“Sure, do you want to stay here, or go over there to our normal place?”
A dark brown pagoda, barriered in intricacies of spiderwebs, speaking Strength; Strength; Fortitude in unheard futility of Fibonacci code.
“Let’s stay here, in the Sun?”
He begins speaking fragments of French:
“Ah, Le Soleil, tres belle”

“The Sun is masculine, isn’t it? Tres Beau?”
I walk inside
And upon crossing and re-crossing the threshold of Room 17, the strange place I will call home for 23 days; I re-emerge pondering the Full moon which entered my soul a mere two days ago 
It was in Aries, I tell him, no wonder I was so affected by it. I’m an Aries. 
I’m an Aries too, he says. 
The Proto-Indo-European:
“Moynis” – common. Mutual. 
“Mey” – to Change – exchange – interchange – swap – 
Share In Common. 



“We do not see the wind. We only see the effects it leaves”
“on the leaves”
“in the leaving”

I share my transmuted thoughts on the conceptual sculpture I attempted on my first day, Malika Maht:
I’ve been thinking – 
The King, 
He seems like he’s holding all the power, only needing to move one space at a time, as the queen rushes around the black and white squares, ensuring his protection, ensuring the ongoing Becoming of the game, doing everything she can to prevent the inevitable ending – 
He seems like he is simply watching, doing nothing as she moves about him –
But in his single square-by-square steps, 
In the very structures that placed him at the centre of this perpendicular monochrome framework of power 
He is not powerful at all 
He is a placeholder 
He is the embodiment of restriction 
It is not that he doesn’t need to move more than one space at a time. 
It is that, due to the rules of this Kafka-authored game we find ourselves within – 
He simply cannot. 
He is in a paralysis of his own – a stasis 
As the queen is - in exhaustion. 
And all the queen’s horses and all the queen’s men 
And all the King’s rawness and all the King’s friends 
And all the pawns awful deplorable ends
Move within meaning, 
Remember. 
Again. 
I glance briefly at the rearranged sculpture, where the Queen now stands alone amidst a crowd of fallen pieces, the beheaded king lying atop the ping pong table. This goes unnoticed. 
“have you had any visitors yet?” he asks. 
“Not any human ones, no.”
Back in my room, at the crack in the window, my empty water bottle jitters, moved by an unseen gentleness, being moved almost to tipping point. I strain my spine to twist from my desk where I write this, to gaze upon its inanimate, anxious animacy. 
Standing up to peer beyond this spectacle of Spirit, I gaze through the glass 
And see a squirrel, hurriedly devouring an acorn 
Quickly, quickly 
Oh the fear everywhere surrounding this moment of stillness like the eye of a storm. 
Still, the plastic water bottle taps an uncertain rhythm, 
Careful
It seems to drum upon the sticky white paint of the windowsill of the window of the 17th Room of this Hospital 
And I wonder what other eyes have looked upon this grass 
Well, 
Not this grass, 
The blades they may have regarded, long gone 
Cycled back into the filth 
To be reborn anew
Where, months later, another mist of rain 
Or a worried squirrel 
May rest, for only a moment
And carefully 
Who else has not caught this moment, but tried?
Reaching?
What other heart has beaten, enduring, in the bowels of a Man of Meaning, Intent upon finding Spirit in this Silent Screaming World 
Do they hear me? 
Can you hear my ears reaching for your voice? 
I tentatively walk out of my room 
Once through the First Two Gates and at reception, I see the Chapel doors ajar.
I ask to be let in, if nobody is using it. 
I finally, finally make it in there 
It feels like a stolen moment 
It feels I shouldn’t be here, 
Danger in the safety –
I lift the lid of the piano and fall deliciously into 
the friendliness of the end of my waiting 
encapsulated in its wooden weight 
The golden hinges give way and the lid transmutes into a windowsill 
Where I place my notebook once clutched and now so readily let go 
Let go 
I lift my finger, shaking from what the psychiatrist calls “tardive dyskinesia”
Tardivus – Late Latin – Tardus – Latin - Obscure Origin – Slow. Sluggish. 
Tardif – French – Late. 
Dys- Greek – Difficult. Abnormal.
Kinesis – Movement. Motion. 
The finger reaches, somehow, the key 
I push away the daily thought of Zeno’s paradox 
If distance be infinitely divisible, how can two bodies ever touch?
The truth is, they cannot
And the deeper truth is, 
In the distance they are never
Dis – Latin – Apart. 
The key rings, metallic – 
Abnormal. 
Dissonant.
Sonare – Latin – To Sound. 
The key in the lock of the Chapel buzzes with harmonics I know do not belong 
I open the body of the piano
Surgically
I see somebody has snapped one of the triplicate strings of the A6. 
But upon extracting the trailing spiral of metal that had – either by nefarious design or by naïve innocent brute force – become woven as a warp through the weft of the other strings and the hammers
But this did not account for the width of the tin can bottles hanging on the back wall of this instrument 
Something else in there 
There was something else in there 
Someone had put something in there 
Someone in my stolen moments was wishing me ill 
Listening to my sound, never hearing it – 
And perhaps in the night, as I lay drugged unconscious, checked on every 3 hours – 
Crept into this holy place 
And broke my final tether to what used to keep me safe. 
But 
“Let us agree” 
Said the Sun
“that he is stronger,
Who can strip that Traveler 
Of his Cloak” 
Opening the door to the walled, walled, walled garden 
I light my umpteenth cigarette 
Smoke catches in my throat as the low lit sight throws itself into my eyes 
The chess pieces have been rearranged by some unseen hand 
The Queen, I can’t find her – 
In her light or dark form, I can’t find her. 
All I see is a white knight, atop the body of the beheaded King (who still lies on the ping pong table) 
And rested on the head of the equine warrior, a torn off rubber red casing of one of the ping pong paddles, like a Kippah 
Shielding the crown from God 
   

In spite of myself, or in spite of a self I don’t recognize anymore;
I pick up the fallen pieces. 
I arrange them into a cruciform shape, leaving this new addition untouched 
Nefarious intent or otherwise, 
I reply in form to the formless hand – 
I see what you have done. And I will raise you. 
 
Forgiveness in defiance. 

I am not fighting anymore 
Not in this place, nor any other 
I surrender to all of this mess
The Mess I – 
Ah, breath 
Of the Silent word 
I refuse to scream to a silent World any longer 
I return to Room XVII 
And Mourn the loss of my oldest friend
My silly fallen leaving windswept and crisping underfooted identity as a musician 
Faithful in whatever form of medium 
This crushing Ore will bleed and Lead me into. 
Gold, losing shine-


Painted on the first day using flip chart paper from the rec room, the only red (chalk) I could find. The number 16 knocking at the door of my perception over and over, until I made something of it. 
Was it The XVIth card of the Tarot – The Tower? 
I am 
In room Seventeen 
The April day of my dragging into Life 
XVI + I 
Am
Here
In this room 
In simple esoteric arithmetic, I think of Ruth 1:16: 
But Ruth replied, “Don’t urge me to leave you or to turn back from you. Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God.”
HE is here with me. Everywhere. 
I cannot escape HIM.
