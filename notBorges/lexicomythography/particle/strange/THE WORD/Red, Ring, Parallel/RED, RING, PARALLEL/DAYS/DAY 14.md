DAY FOURTEEN

I told her 
My therapist 
What happened 
What he did 
No guilt, no shame 
Just anger sadness Pity 
For the little man
From the pagoda 
Where now sits a single white bishop 
And a note 
I wrote and folded 
Emblazoned with a Keats quote:
Heard melodies are sweet 
But Unheard melodies are sweeter 





The black queen was toppled 
By an unseen 
But known
So known 
Hand
And the King placed back upon His Throne 

And so 
I gently lay down all the pieces around him, leaving Him untouched 
And bring the Black queen into my bedroom 
Place her lovingly in my wardrobe 
Protect her 
Protect her 
Protect her 
As no
Body 
Else
Will
