day 5
Today I really tried. 
Hospital is difficult. 
Everything feels amplified. 
Really, just cacophonous 
Eating around others is hard. 
I just feel so alone, how am I 
Supposed to do this alone but I 
Suppose I’ve never known any other way 
Oh God – 
My heart – 
Endless echo 
Through time
Hurting hold of dark 
I know nothing else. 
Night time my dwelling 
Gulls, Crows, Magpies, hear me, 
I hear you, please hear me 
Now
Trying so 
Hard please help me
I don’t 
Need people I need
The birds 
Hole, hollow, holy of holies –
Earth’s wound is weeping 
Bleeding
Arterial aqueduct 
Sighing
Echoing
Meaning, memory 
Entity unknown but
Near to me
Trying to get in

Suddenly, the roar of a fire alarm. 
We were all gathered in the patient lounge, urgently. 
I ran, images of the almost-fire that led me here emblazoned in my exposed-wire mind. 
Sat shaking, I try to comfort the man next to me, who because of the upheaval, was about to go into seizure. 
Across from me, a woman reels off story after harrowing story about her trauma, and I try to remain centred, wishing her love, knowing her pain, feeling her pain, feeling it far too much. Most of the work I have to do here is about building energetic boundaries. Not letting these unseen forces into the felt sense of my body, so worn down from three decades of taking in, taking in, taking in everything thrown onto me.
But she saw my own tears, and whatever dissonance she held decided to expel itself unto me, staring into my eyes with a vicious glare, while her mouth opened to quickly snarl “NO”, specifically at me. 
I still do not know why.  
I have been finding it so incredibly hard to balance my organic need to care for those in need, and my unnaturally depleted survival instinct of self-preservation. 
The grey has always been hard to find. 
But this night, there was a gossamer grey filling the air. 
A smoke.
The man next to me and I implored the lead nurse to tell us what was happening, as she put on a Fire Equipment backpack. And I quote: 
“there’s something in the basement.” 
I saw a fire truck pull in outside, due to my unique perspective afforded by the placement of my room, facing the front garden. 
I try to calm myself down, tears streaming, shaking uncontrollably, until the familiar mist of dissociation falls like a weighted blanket over my eyes; which I realise have rested themselves upon a bowl of fruit to my left 
Specifically, an Apple. 
Four minutes pass 
We are told it was a drill, and to return to our rooms 
It takes me a good 10 minutes to move my legs
