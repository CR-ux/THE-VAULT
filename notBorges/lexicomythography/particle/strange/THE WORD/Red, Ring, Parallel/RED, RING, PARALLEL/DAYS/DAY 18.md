DAY EIGHTEEN
My left hip
Foot
Shin 
Thigh
It’s all in agony 
The left 
Sinistral side
The feminine 
The grounded part of my microcosm, unrooted 
Uncertain 
What will happen 
Will any Justice come
On this
The Day of The Star 
The Number of My Room 
The Feeling of the Last Judgement 
The Night of No
Thing
I walk the gavel path 
to the resting place of my Grey Dove Spirit 
Regard her under sodden leaves, 
Keep walking, two, three metres 
And find the little home of leaves 
I made for the injured bee, for Leaving 
Whether to Returning cycles of Flight 
Weathering another Storm 
Or floating further, to beyond 
To side without a briefest candle 
Out
The unlit burning place I feel inside 
But She Is Gone 
Her Body No Longer Under 
This Shantytown Hospital I tried to build 
The Bee, a Lark, a Phoenix 
An Branching Olive Tree 
In Autumn, with no fruits to see 
But That Truthing Dark, that leaves, Unseen 
I knew that she’d found Peace 
Not in Death of her Gentle Body 
But in Sky – 
By drop, by drip of dewy ceiling - 
The Bee had been revived 
And crying, I steady my stance, 
Regarding all the trodden plants about me 
Making way for such a Spring 
Unknown 
But Felt 
In Felting Fuzz of This Absent Creature 
In Contrast to the stillness three 
Steps, or Metres, left behind me 
Covered in a futile paperthin 
Reminder 
Of the yesses 
Given far to readily. 


The difference between psychosis and mystical wisdom 
Is the difference between a framework
And a cage 
Man Has Forgotten All His Symbols
And so His Brain creates them, artificially 
A veritable pathology 
A sweeping swell of Ork-clad orchestra 
Singing Holy! Holey! Holey! 
Oh!
The pulling sting of this Dis-Ease

The fear 
From constant threat 
From the constant battle 
The constant chess game of this place
Why did they have to put a giant chess board in the Walled, Walled, War Garden 
No Warden, No warning 
Just A Solitary Warrior 
I do not wish to be a sinner 
I just need proof
To read
A sign a symbol
A basket 
Of Red 
Of reddest reed 
Of reading 
to carry me 
through denying lies and idling smiles 
and scowls of judgement placed upon me 
The First the Last 
The Last The First 
The First To Break The Last To Mend 
I’m not sure if this place was ever meant for me 
This 
Place 
This 
Earth 
My Worth, that is an unshakable certainty. 



And then 
Under the door
Under it 
So gently
Comes this little gift 
With a note 
That read
As it is above, so it is below
A watercolour palette 
From Lindsay 
The Water-meadow 


Knock at Room 17’s door 
It is Hind, the psychologist 
She tells me without breaking confidentiality 
There wouldn’t be a patient sectioned due to being a risk to others on this ward
And so, 
A Ward – Lighting a way to the truth 
Mark. 
The fucking White King 
Cleaved of his Cross
Which I stuff with the Fungus that he 
And his wretched Fog Mother 
told 
The Pawn 
To kick over 
Stuffed it all in there, to the brim 
And like a Stake 
I placed a red ping pong paddle in the middle 
A Warning 
A Reminder of What Took Place Here 
Which apparently, they all need but will not Hear 
But Here, 
This Reminder Is For Me. 
And there he will Sit, as long as is necessary 
Letting all the pieces move, and move, and move, 
Away from him 
Pulling, Bishop, Pulling, Knight, 
Neigh
Pushing 
Buckling
focus away from him 
Distraction tactics as an erroneous Endgame 
Actually – deep, deep, squelching deep into the midgame -
To fearmonger heliocentricity 
about this scared little Sun 
Behind the cloud of the fog of his mother 
Just looking for the softness 
A feminine edge 
 with no ending sense of reflection 
Just looking for the water 
Just so lonely in the nonsense 
And this despicable man 
Spreading lies about him 
Making all the women so, so afraid, 
Both directly 
Through the ogling of our Bodies 
Through the touching of himself while he asks for supposed necessary touch of comfort from me  
To prevent a ‘fit’ 
No. 
The Reeds
I’ve Read 
The pieces
These chess pieces. 
Do Not. 
Fit. 

Saying goodbye to Lindsay 
Waving farewell to the Death 
Greeting whatever Change may come to Room 13 
Back to my room Seventeen 

I think of the caduceus 

Sinistral Memory
Nowness Rod 
Dextral Meaning 
Leading
Where?
To a Grove 
Floating, blowing
Gossamer
Where I write this 
As I try to catch it - 
And try to think of ways to hide identity 
To protect not any of them, but me 
Last night, as if enraptured by repeating melody 
Echoing through to the beginning from the end 
Of the last recorded syllable of time 
I thought of leaving 
Leaving with the Leaves 
But neigh this knight 
And Stirrupped is my soul 
My resolve to Stay upon this board 
and find the grey they’ve all been missing 




Cain and Abel 
 


Markov chain 
Memoryless behaviour 
State 
Transitions
Movement from one state to another 
In a Markov chain the movement of states depends only on the current state, not on the sequence of events that led to the current state. 
Seven magpies scattering from a pile of dead leaves 
Seven 
Spiritual introspection 
Scatter 
Revelation
Uncovering of Secrets 
The Last Judgement 
The King 
Paints the Pawn 
As the King Himself 
For Protection 
Deception 
Sacrifice 
The misuse of Power 
Using those as weaker to shield himself 
The Queen is Missing. 
The Queen is enclosed within a tomb of protection of her own 
Garlanded by red 
Pushing the pawn 
To the End of the Board 
The White King without a Cross 
Seeming, so vulnerable 
Move, 
What I’m making you do
Do quickly – 
Urging the pawn forward to the end of the Board 
Transform to a queen 
This Missing Queen 
But still, 
Remaining White 
The Structures Continue 
Despite the Newfound strength 
Still, drained of hue 
The Dark Queen is Still Missing.
She exists 
Outside 
Of the Board 


The greatest threat Sits in the Pagoda 

Because Black, 
The Darkness, 
Is Reflective
Absorbing everything 
The Moon
But White 
In its supposed illumination 
Is blinding 
The Son 
Is
Farther
Father 
Supposed clarity 
Stark 
Nuances and subtlety 
Washing out detail 



How clever is The King
I think 
As Dick & Darcy sit opposite me
Discussing all the Foxes on the grounds 
Approaching with birds in their mouths 
Darcy, only eighteen 
Saying
He’d seen one with a squirrel in its mouth
How clever is The King 
The Cleverness in the eye of Sight
And hand in hand 
Comes revelatory 
Cleverness
An Unchecked Box
The Fox, that wears a Mask
Masculinity - 
The deadened Dove upon my path
The Fox’s wrath
Oh God
How Wrong I’ve Been 
In Judgement’s Past
The Hardest Sell 
And Judgements Passed
The First, 
The Last 
The Cellar Door
The Cell
The Mast
Or, More - 
Beginning Secrets, They Have Wrought
I Thought I’d Known the Answers
But I never even thought
To Ask 






 What has changed here
Everything 
Yet
Only 
Eye
Every time 
My mood, in shift 
The Moon
I sense the ocean of belonging 
Or unknowing
Or unbelonging Longing
Filling everything
Everyone 
I feel change 
Without 
Within 
I feel a nightingale 
Shift 
A lark, 
A burning Dove 
Screaming into silence 
Not Screaming anymore 
Bound
Aries 
Ovum 
Exit
Oval 
Gallileo, you were wrong
So low-strung 
Hope
Of noose’s lung 
To breathe 
And Teach me everything 
Oh, Gallileo – 
How hurtful were your circles 
You tried to split and twist by wrist into
No Sphere 
No Sapphire 
Here
No 
An Oval 
Is an exit 
The heart a creaking gate
Opened on a closing pulse 
Formidably too late 
Kept getting swept out 
To this vastness 
Of this mast cell clashing 
Absolutely Asking 
For an answer to the Lightning
Smack 
Attacking anything with Entropy 
Entering me, 
The feeling 
Of everything 
Bound, my fire 
Bound, the ram 
I’m reigning in desire 
Oh pyre of my destiny 
Stretching 
Reaching out – 
A hand 
This hand 
To hold 
My hand 
I have two hands to hold each other 
I have
Some 
Body 
Split in Two 
For a reason 
Split into 
A meaning 
Division of the face, the ears, this year, my seasons
The purpose of this hurt, divide 
This agony 
 for the duality 
to meet itself as Other 
For the Self to know it Self It Must Be Split To Become Whole 
I am not a child because I am not whole but becoming in knowing that 


What if I put the black queen back 
And everything 
And everyone 
Gets better because of it?
And what if better isn’t what they need 
And who am I to even decide it 
And what if the Word was all I needed 
But neglect 
Neglect 
Getting pulled like a magnet back to neglect 
Neglect 
Oh, fuck it 
Depth 
And fettered Debt 
I’ve always really had it 
 

Try
Meds
Fail
Phone
Dies
Meadow
Dry
Forgotten 
Phone 
Mrs Meadow Finds her Medicine 
Through the Sacred Masculine 
Driving Audi, 
Perceived and Felt True Strength 
A chariot blazing into deepest waters 
His name is Aster 
Shimmering 
I find myself Thanking the Stars by Which He Is Named 
For Hearing Every Winter
Every Summer, Spring and Falling of his Lover 
Striking through the chains that bound her 
Reminding her of the Sword 
The Force 
Of Fours
The Stables of the Horse 
The Knight 
The Black Knight Barrels through 
And Death; 
Riding Over All Us Children 
As we hold the purest blossom high 
Welcoming, 
Welcoming, 
Wellness
Is Coming



And then 
Dream 
Rape
Role Reversal
Illumination
The Sun
