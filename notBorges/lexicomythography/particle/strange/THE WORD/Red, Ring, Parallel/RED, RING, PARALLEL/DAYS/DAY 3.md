DAY THREE –
No music. No Sound. Only Silent, Screaming Form:

The king’s gambit / Malika Maht
**the king’s gambit. 2024** or

**ملكة** **ماتت** **(Malika Maht)**
**_“the queen is helpless”_**
Deconstructed oversized chess pieces. Table tennis paddles. ink, charcoal, pulverised dandelions picked from between paving slabs, saliva, and tears on rec room flip chart paper. foraged fallen leaves and flowers picked from the small, sacred patch of green surrounding the concrete chess board of a psychiatric hospital garden.
my first foray into contemporary sculpture would of course be here
instead of leaving it up to interpretation, as perhaps should be done with art that is good, I will simply tell you my creative intent explicitly, because it is Bad Art Made To Be Impermanent - this work is about assault. Specifically, the aftermath of assault. More specifically, the aftermath of assault by the person supposed to be the last to lay a finger on you. Even more specifically, the aftermath of assault by the person supposed to be the last to lay a finger on you and the unbending black and white structures that lead to so many soldiers in what you previously thought was your legion to fall away, piece by piece, until all is left is -
The two queens, the conscious and unconscious feminine survivor mind, crowned by the beheaded (sacrificed) pawn which now sprouts faded colours of memory, garlanded by what used to be alive, stand surrounded by all the other pieces (salvaged remaining fragments of both conscious and unconscious selfhood) in a protective shield of futility. Reaching, reaching. Failing. But so delicately. So naively gossamer in their attempt at tessellating into an impenetrable barrier woven against the warping loom of sovereignty. The phallic chimera of Kings.
the bishops, the wailing cries to a higher power, the last hope, the trumpets of the final judgement pleading, biting down onto the paddles against the pain, their screams being silenced, the pain in itself the prime silencer, the paddles in their mouths. The paddles in their mouths. the knights, the searing rage of injustice which moves in such peculiar L-shaped paths spelling Loss in Ivory, Loss in Obsidian, Losing Light, Loosed, the Dark. The rooks, great barrelling chariots of the Cardinal blasted Towers. the once sturdy castles now crumbling into the moat of death dressed up as art or death dressed up as trash or death dressed up as itself in the falling leaves of so many oneiroi. moving only back and forth from trauma to a projected future of unthinkably thinkable, unbelievably believable repeating patterns -In perpendicular- cross-section to every. Single. Moment.
The pawns, the fundamentally preservative joys of life, the small but so important moments of connection to this world, the front line of defence, a flimsy fleeting fickle group of their own - will so readily and thoughtlessly sacrifice themselves to the Kings, because, really, the game is just too complicated, and rather than attempting their own transfiguration to a queen, just a few brave steps away, with all its risk and own suffering through allegiance with the Grieving; where the Kings may then be outnumbered, but no, the battle is too long, these simple things can fall away first, there is too much weight to carry and there are other matches going on and nobody really understands the politics of all this turn-based war except those directly at the mercy of its oppression and therefore holding all responsibility for victory
Or, more likely-
Defeat
And at the Queens’ feet
The leaves
Dried
Leaving such light emptiness in their nested wake
Drained of hue
Leaving,
the nest
Sleep
Walking
A
Way
Out
Of Here where it’s too crowded 
Too many bodies
Too loud too heavy too big we haven’t had the right military training
We just don’t know what to do with-
Leaving something behind
Was it March?
Marching
Kneading
Bred
Kneeling
Bouging bough
Breaking
Needing
Rest
Festering
For months
For years that seem like yesterday
A life of the same sentence strung together like a letter-pearl[◯](#_ftn1) necklace or a noose
Or cold cardiac electrodes
placed upon a shaking naked chest
But was it March?
Or was it always marching
Two by two and only
to
a tightly crinkled little nest
Leaving
 the Janusian Queens and their inmost shroud of rain stained symbols, exposed.
for the sake of the approval of The (mere) two king pieces stacked perfectly on top of one another.
only two of them, and yet, still able to overshadow, peer and leer over all of this desperate and so fragile attempt at survival;
Never looking down
Never even needing to
Just
Knowing
never having to move more than one square about the place
to know how it all moves and builds itself into such twisted, trying monuments to the Marks those Royal Marksmen left in the Leaving
Raking, leaving
In the taking
Kicking
Strangling
Hitting
Letting
Neglect
And lightning strike
Of violence
By the one   loved best
Happen
This was also a durational piece. A question. I waited many hours returning to the garden, hoping for its destruction by the comings and goings of other patients, perhaps wanting to play their own chess match, or simply feel the childlike awe of knocking down a domino-esque structure. When this never happened, I took it upon myself to topple and sever the amalgamation of Kings, leaving the Queen’s nest untouched. For now.
