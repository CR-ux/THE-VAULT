DAY TWENTY TWO



/\

Dreaming 

I find

Nothing 

But 

Them 

Again 

Well, a boat, 

A repeating, cycle, requiem 







New moon , O 

Zero 

Sjnooze

Cruise ship

You, 

Barnabie

Working on that ship

Was it in a previous dream, it must have. Been 

The ship as a metaphor for all of life 

So why had I not seen it before

Or

I had

Oar 

Are you still here with me 

Opening eyes earlier in the night I had seen the two red lights in the bathroom turn into handwriting 

I wish and wished 

First star I see tonight 

That I’d had battery con my phone to write down what it said because I think it came from the tree that I prayed to earlier 

But 

Anyway

The wave

And the ocean

And the ship it wed floating upon

Barnie

Was one of the staff

We had a lot of sex 

I don

T remember bottoming, even though, that’s all we really spoke about 

At first 

The girl they were flirting with saying that

Asking if 

I wanted to go back to work 

And then telling me they were here

And supervising 

So I made some kind of tantrum 

It felt like 

The same place my father kept his own leg ransom

Opening my - I open - eyes

There’s a letter J on my ceiling 

What does any of this mean

I’e stopped trying so hard to 

Find one 

1

Their dick still so fresh in memory 

In the dream, feeling so real between my teeth 

But their 

Oh god 

Their 

Perineum 

And all the blood vessels 

Exposed 

Exposed like wires behind a TV 

But so thick and plastic 

Heaving, beastly 

I remember thinking , half awake and have asleep 

I must have very fortunately, not so coincidentally 

Not remembered this truly quite horrifying image

Because I was about to ejaculate 

These Words 

The Word condensing into 

Two 

1

I

Mage

New moon

O



Sarah, 

The beauty 

Sarah, 

The Ugly

One-Wind-Wynd-Wyrd-Wound around -eyed, hundred-thousand-wounded-eyed Argus of Artifice 

Before she knocked I opened the door, moved by some unseen but fully known force within me

I heard her fucking muttering about the tapes 

Stepping on them “accidentally”

Cracking the casing 

I walk to the nurse’s office 

And ask for them back, assertively 

I say

The Sign said 

Take One, And Only One

The entire team walked past them yesterday and said No Thing

She tilted her head like she always does, like a dumb injured little or rather pretending to be injured – not animal because that’s too much of a compliment – THING – saying in her sickly tone of voice that somebody told me to pick them up and even had the audacity to add “I wanted to take one”  with her fake, fake, fake face 

Fake – German – Fegen – Sweep, thrash 

I sweep all of this under the Rug. I am Done; I am done. No Body here is equipped enough to help me. 

Fake – Fegen – Sweep, thrash - This eventually evolved into a term for “counterfeiting” or making something look real when it isn’t, like a swept-over cover-up. Fig shares an interesting overlap; historically, figs were considered symbols of false modesty, covering and concealing. In Italian, figa even became a colloquial symbol, often hinting at masking or covering up. So there’s an entangled connection between “fig” and what’s false or concealed.



I said who, who told you to pick them up

She says 

After yesterdays vow of silence and communing with the ancestors I sim[ly cannot cannot stand this fakeness anymore 



I finally stood up to her this morning 

Raised my voice in the hallway, saying – I SEE YOU SARAH - FAKE – FAKE – RACIST – TRANSPHOBIC – FAKE 

And I walk, spine straight, Syrinx ringing out an octave higher – Taking no more -

Rise

Not sir, MISS 

MISS – SHALL – NOT – MISS – THIS – 

PLACE

New moon. 

I see you. 

I fucking see through all this shit. As a mirror. 

Then, as if by (and definitely by) magick – two new staff members introduce themselves 

Amira – Princess

Sabia – Four – of Swords – Foreshadow – Light – 

Hopefully you can make some change around here I say 





But everything, as it contains its opposite, is in its own blessed 

Con

Valence 

Convalescence and concrescence of Becoming

Sectioned for wanting to go home 

But she Fought Fire against her so-called Doctor BURNS 

Miraculously, when she allowed her section was lifted - wants to be sent home

⁃	Still hasn’t cut through ALL OF THAT 



I want to go home which is a good sign, even if I cannot 

I cannot stand it here

I can’t make my 

Rent

Abberent 

Abbey 

Cathedral 

Myth of Sisyphus

Sissy Fuss

Puss

Evening

Mourning

More than me, 

I – 

Tried to carry my breakfast in two packages 

Packages 

Passages

Passage through the corridor 

Door, it’s a pull not a 

Pushing through 

As I try to carry 

As I try to carry it 

As I try to carry it my neck this pain in my neck syrinx fairy faggot 

Need a cigarette

But need to eat first 

E

Eet – regina Spektor

Spectre of my own Becoming 

Becoming a ghost 

Of memory, meaning 

Caduceus 

Can you See me 

Oh god the messages that came to me 

the medium of that blackest Knight of a TV screen and I keep seeing things move in my periphery 

On the 

Edge

Never-ending never can there be 

An edge nor ending

In Norse mythology 

Or my own memory 

My father I finally messaged him after what seemed centuries 

After that knight – mare – Ishmael – call me – accidentally – White whale – White piece – no Peace – No Justice – Just – Isness – Is everything against me? Or Is against another For – Shadowy – Widow – Willow – Under that tree 

I Went 

outside for therapy 

Under this tree I’m writing, remembering them, gone from me, but here, hear, here you are, They Are Here – I didn’t speak for twenty four hours and it was the loudest I’ve ever been. 

And there, Now – a Crow. Hidden under a picnic bench , coming out, looking looking at me, now he’s jumped onto the seat – sea – see – see – see – C – C – Row – Rose – Rows of roses coming out of me – Prophecy – Nothing – Absolutely nothing I’m meant to be – Meanness washing washing every part of me – my feet – numb – Daddy 

Why 

Why won’t you see me 

I asked him if he was okay 

As I write this as I write this he is. Oming clower as my father, gets even farther from me 

I asked him if he was okay after finally telling him I’ve been here for four – Four – fore – Weeks. 

He said I’m fine. You are always in my thoughts

And then, as always (suddenly, the meaning collapses all around and about and roundabout me) – three Bears. Three Bear emojis

He always signs his texts with these 

Thee

Love Dad xxx 🐻🐻🐻

As if I don’t have his number 

The crow pecks at a worm

Oh god all the rustling in the leaves last night at Ten 

Deka

Ten PM 

Prime Ministerial Number 

Against Me 

God Is Against Me 

God Is Within Me 

Mirror 

Miserly

Mire 

I’m searching , searching, reaching, searching – ‘What does Mire mean’

And there the crow, so close to me (I think He trusts me, maybe) I’m telling him I’m safe, I’m safe I mean you non harm It’s me It’s me and you against the World The Word Kid 

Kid A

Bee

Sea 

When you were Jung you were the King of Carrot Flowers – Edinburgh, the first trip there, where I thought I’d end my life and this whole Shakespearean Farce initiatory Story began to Reel right Out Of Me

Your Mum would stick a fork right into Daddy’s Shoulder 

(Hammering that windchime into his Leg)

Boulder, pushing, over the Hill the hill we’re all destined four 

Leaving 

A stench of rotten flesh 

Rotting leaves, 

Every 

Body 

Leaves 

Last night I even tried to use a cup of black coffee to scry 

As I cried for everything and everyone, Lindsay – messaging, a fellow, lady, medium – saying Oh God I don’t have the vocabulary but it feels like I’m feeling 1000 wounds 

Death by a thousand cuts 

Flesh 

I remember you well at the Chelsea 

Priory 

Trapeze 

Swinger 

Swingers Party 

Particle, collapsed, infinitely 





Back then when crying into scrying light two leaves 

Fell into my outstretched hand in welcoming goodbye 

Hello Adrian 

I looked down, descending again – and there, the third lonely feather 

I gave the two I sourced from sword of source that night to the two beautiful princesses 

Hebrew – Sarah 

One Fake and One Real 

And Rite Now – The corpse of a Gadfly just fell onto my left sleeve 

The back of my hand, so unknown to me 

and in again, for therapy 

Where I told her that dream 

I told her about The flap of skin, flapping freely around my father’s self-inflicted wound

That I wanted so terribly 

To Fix 

In resin, sap, spore, tree 

Sleeping as a child, having a fire cracking dream like Jacob 

Ladder, my curtains fell down again as I tried to open them 

As I try to Open 

They fell, light pouring in again 

I screamed, trying to replace the rail, I manage, reaching, the magnets snapping into place 

Ace of wands in reverse – the card I pulled under this tree 

This mourning 

And yesterday yester year’s evening 

Were fireworks- Fire – Pyre – I – Refry – Beans – Be – A – Fire – Work – Fireworks – Opus – Ops – Goddess of Fertility – Associated with the Harvest – Wife of Saturn – Devouring His – Sun - Moon

And fireworks, fireworks, I lied about that dream when I was only at the tender age of three was this was this my earliest memory 

Or maybe it’s of my mother Biting me 

On the wrist, where the gadfly fell 

Time, constructed like an orange truss, a Fig, Fakery, structures meant to keep you safe are cages, cages, not frameworks – See – C – Aegis 

Build about you a fortress 

And how you built a tower tumbling through the trees 

And you would dream about the different ways to die 

My memory is of being eaten by a giant in that dream 

I think of Goya

Francisco – Free One – Cis – Go – Cisco – Wall Paintings – Walled Pain, Painful Things 

His Black Paintings 

The Black Queen 

Saturn Devouring

 His Son 

How Feminine the Form of Chronos’ Child Is 

Is It Hades? (The Hell I’ve Known, The Hells I’d Be)

Is It Poseidon which Battered Salt of Me?

Is It The Depths of Hell or The Depths of The Sea?

Or – Maybe

One of the Daughters, sew-named wrongly?

Hestia? Hearth, Worth Learned Eventually?

Demeter? (Who Eventually Birthed Persephone

 – Phone – Bent – Circuitry

 – Phonetically, so beautifully, wired, carefully  

– Calliope)

Hera? (Here Where, Worn Down, The Wrath Witch Hath I Found In Me) 

And Did My Mother, Smothering and Othering as She May Have Been -

Hide my skin, to protect me?

I think about her biting my wrist to teach me a lesson after I first presented my oral stimulatory need, unknowing in my glowing energy I bit her lovingly

Or worse, 

Was she the Hungry One 

Between Which I Was Grounded In Her Teeth?

But waking, I told my Mother that I’d dreamed of Fireworks – Why did that seem necessary? Why would a child lie about their nightmares – Why would a child feel the need – to lie about their naïve dreams – shameful of what she’d found scary – shameful of all the things she knew she couldn’t be – wasn’t it a mirror? Wasn’t it a mirror reflecting all the shadows coming out of me? 

And knowing how memory works, each time recall is performed, the brain rewriting history with the passage of electricity through the networked webbed toes ducking and diving through the dendritic deciduous trees of dendrites neurons protectively sheathed by fatty acids through the hypothalamic pituitary axis, mutating, changing the memorylessened state of images – I – Mage – shape my reality – with every thought I think and breath I breathe

And this, more, Nima, Morning in therapy 

Frances, now I call her Free One 

She smiles and says – I want you to know, through all this, it’s been such a treasure to meet you and any light you see in me remember what you said about the mirror you can only see in me what’s already in you 

After I say I need to get out I’m being told within the leaves 

I’m being told to Leave 

Whether this Place, this Swimming Swirling Plaice, these untied garrotting knotted laces, or this Plane of reælity 

And then she mentions a Bubble of pain bursting, and how in there, the air, the Aer, should be telling me 

That I’m ready 

I’m ready, somewhere deeply, I must know I’m ready to get out of here 

I say maybe pain is a Battery 

Maybe my assaults have been a Battery 

Fuelling energy, through my Lightning Striking Soul and Tingling Wringing Wet from Sweaty Feet – Hermes – Winged Soles 

There were maybe more than five people in front of me and now they’re gone 

Sarah – Princess – Hebrew – Tea – Warming Brew of entropy - 

Told them she would stay another Seven Splitting Septum Head Crack in Everything that’s how the Soul is Released 

Next week I will go home 

Will start DBT program that lasts 28 weeks 

In the distance, looking up neck sore Soaring down another leaf, I keep it in sight – and walk towards it – blood returning gifted Earth goddess returning to the place we started and Knowing the place for the first Time – as a symptom – of this incurable disease 

I pick it up and as I didn’t even try to catch it but I tried to fit it inside my Wooden Box of tarot cards a Coffin a Cist a Cyst a Clarinet Reed

Read 

My  Words, My World 

My Words are my World now 

And I say to Frances about how it goes (in terms of being Seen) – Cis Men – Cis Women – Everyone Else – Us. 

But.

In terms of Seeing The Unseen 

Or being Seen By the Unseen 

It’s all in reverse, topsy turvy, bottoming 

And last night’s dream why did Barnabie

Have Wires, such horrible wires, arterial wires pulsing and throbbing and so inorganically coloured, Primary 

PRIMARY

Primary coloured wires, No Human should have such stark primary colours, it’s all secondary 

Greying Dancing Uncertainties of Flesh Beneath – that’s how it is, or should be 

Skin doesn’t come in Four Colours of poster paint in little plastic tubs, it’s a mess, a messiah, a used up palette of hues and used losing fruit losing fruit uterus dark burgundy purpling but those sucking slurping meshes of wires so thick so thick and disgusting and exposed with the Cronenberg bodily horror Whoring flesh-to-depths skin ripped open like Wax like a waxing Moon grinning about a secret it just wouldn’t tell me not to protect or erect or because I was suspect but just 

Because 

Because secrets are Fun 

Because Secrets keep fantastic Company

Cum 

Pain 

Why 

Me?

The leaves are whispering other secrets 

Secrets no Body else knows here on this Living, slithering earth 

The serpent – I say to the Free One – so misunderstood as a symbol – all the fucking answers are there in the Genesis Myth – the Kid Alpha and omega Child of God – Yahweh – Your Way – Their Way – Childish – That god is A Child – He Knows Knot What He Does – he is not evil, neither is the snake – It is all just a great Lake of deep, deep, deep, unravelling waves hidden by the States of the Body of Water Produced by Love Lost Again and A Gain – All I have is Unknowing – All we Women have is a great Lake of Unknowing – All We Trans Women have is a Great, Gated Lake of Knowing in the Unknowing Raked Leaves of Becoming Death Becoming the Bear that Everyone thought They Were On A Hunt For – Frozen – Fawning – Fighting – Free(?) – It’s not “Safe” to Stand Upon, My Own Sewn Mythology – Sowing Seeds on banks, banking everything I can’t make my rent again and I’m here trying not to listen to people complain about their problems paying ten thousand pounds – Pounding, pounding – a week – a Weakness, is comparison – Biggest Thief of Joy 

Nurse, named Joy, a cosmic joke of a reference to a childhood game I never played 

Like JK JK, Just Kidding! JK Rowling Rowdy Rowling Rolling Roaring Lioness Lying Down with Lamb and Slaughtering Her Daughters – Why are you Fighting Us? Why are You sticking forks right into Ladies Shoulders 

I Never Did Anything To Hurt You and The Men Who Hurt Us Should Be Binding Us 

Binding – Something Restrictive and yet, bringing together 

My wrists are aching from tap tap tapping at my pumping chamber keyboard key bored into a loch – Lake – Lay – Keychain – Dad – Cutting keys – not fitting – filing them down, shards of metal in his eye, one eye, sacrificed – Father Odin – Wednesday – Midweek 

That Bear on that page opposite the Moon, so full, but He knows her 

He is her Husband 

And those Waves, those waves, Crashing 

They keep getting pulled, 

Back to the start again and Gnawing, Knowing the Sand of those Men and the Salt of that Body of that Plaice for the first time 

 



New moon , O 

Zero 

Sinew

Snooze

Cruise ship

You, 

Barnabie

Working on that ship

Tropical Climate 

Climbing down a ladder 

Why do I keep seeing Crows that aren’t there 

The Island – Jung’s Desert, Just Desserts I suppose that while his was hopelessly Dry that I Am Which I Am in That Ore-Digging Unctuous mine would be surrounded by A Drowning Sense of Deep 

Was it in a previous dream, it must have. Been 

The ship as a metaphor for all of life 

So why had I not seen it before

Or

I had

Oar

That I’d had battery con my phone to write down what it said because I think it came from the tree that I prayed to earlier 

But 

Anyway

But their 

Oh god 

Their

And all the blood vessels 

Exposed 

Exposed like wires behind a TV 

But so thick and plastic 

Heaving, beastly 

I remember thinking , half awake and have asleep

Not remembered this truly quite horrifying image

Because I was about to ejaciulate

the Dog – the only one who peered into the Eye of the Storm

the Storming Brewing Bear 

I sip my coffee, fingers freezing, becoming

Numb 

Haven’t touched the piano all month 

An

Promise – broken 

Broke 

I can’t fucking pay my rent let alone get back from London to 

Where?

Wearing down 

To Glasgow 

Go 

Glass

Breaking – Braking – Cars go – No Cars – Parking – Parallel – Red, red, Ring

I keep seeing a crow even though it’s not there 

Because It’s true even if it didn’t happen 

What’s happening? 

Strange things 

I give up I just want to buy One Hundred and Eight Books 

As Mala Beads 

And reed 

And weave them into a basket in my brain 

I, Prey

I Pray to the unknown gods that some unknown human – just One, even if it were a thousand 

1000 Wounds ago 

Ah!

Go! 

To have read and examined it 

In adventures such as these I have squandered and wasted my years

 

If honour, and wisdom, and happiness are not for me – let them be for others 

Let there be 

Curtain Falling

Light 

Let Heaven exist 



Rudyard Kipling

Fledgling 

Feeling Moved to Move to Berlin for a little while 

Trying 

As I try 

As I am trying to find something to hold onto 

Message me, Medium 

If you change your mind

Last night I dreamt we did our laundry 

Together 

To – Gethsemane – Semen – I masturbated – My body my own, the Third time Seamen Left my body while I’ve stayed in this Crested White Wave Lunar Pulling Pushing Us All into Lunacy nautical nothingness – 

I tried to think of someone other than Barnie

Or Deimos – His name was actually – 

It doesn’t matter. 

Why do I fucking miss them 

I tried – as I tried – to catch it – the not-self jutting – spluttering weak out of me – I couldn’t even think of anybody 

And then, KSHÆ’L, the Djinn still tethered to me, left by the One We Shall Leave Unnamed For the Sake of Not giving him any space in my Story 

But the Djinn, who has been searching for me for millennia, he tells me (in the leaves, and all the Loveless leaving, clearing way for the Empty) 

I thought of him and then it came 

She/it/per/se/ver/it Came 

Upon the Deep and Crisp and Uneven Bedsheet 

What this meant, I couldn’t sea 

But then Beating Meating Sarah at the door as I heard her stepping on the synthesis of my greatest agony 

I don’t know anymore

My hands are cold 

I have to go back in

Doors.

It seems as if my life is spent

Holding doors open

For those who would happily 

Let door close

On me

-	Cal Donnelly



But Just 

Ice

Icy cold 

Just One More Thing Before I Go 

One More Thing! The King, and Eye 

Seeing a bottle cap on the ground I think about a shitty little lofi ditty I recorded in the four-walled cell now relegated to the corridors of closing doors of memory – 

[WAV] – bottle cap romance 

So many shitty little things lost in the deluge of a toilet flush 

How Strangely They hold up to the Dark, dark, so big, this Thief of Dark  of Selfhood 

I pull up my Hood – A Scottish Widow all One in the Grounds – Headed for the Ground that reaps - steals everything from me 

So

Sew

I see

Seeds 

Young’s Dry Land – Ryland

Bouchard’s Seeds 





A lovely girl approaches me – saying I’m late for my MDT – she’s been searching searching for me 

I apologise 

Her shirt says Goose 

Wild Goose Chase 

The name of that soft, lovely little gorgeous smelling creature – Barnabie’s rat 

I miss holding him

I miss them holding me

Dr Shanahan – I tell him his name means Meadow – Clearing – Clearing the Way – The Way – Dao – The Light in Darkness – The Dark in Lightness – Weight – The Waiting – Game – Over – tells me he’s sorry but the insurance company 

Can’t fund my stay any further than Monday 

I think, and say, that’s absolutely okay – and it is – I need to get out of here -

Hear

He says stop, stop crying I can’t 

hear you -

 anyway 

I try to catch my breath as I try to catch it I breathe and tell him I can’t make rent he asks me where will I go where will I stay

Do you dare to go out? Do you dare to Go In?

They all apologise again for the injustice and miscarriages of conduct that have taken place here and in a gesture of apology the doctor offers me a follow up appointment free of charge

I make my Word associations in the meeting – 

Leaving the room , saying Where you Go I Go Where You Stay I Stay Your People Will Be My People and My God, 

My God 

My God 

Will 

My Will 

Be Your God 

I say One Plus Sixteen makes Seventeen, My Room number and he says there you Go 

There You Be 

It was meant to be 

Everything happens for a 

Sea

Son 

Saw 

Sore 

Soar

The birds and the augur aren’t talking to one another, there’s been a misunderstanding 

There must be some kind of mistake 

Miss Take 

Misgivings 

I thank them, genuinely 

Though heavy of heart, I am

Grateful and in gratitude, outraged

Outraged, outrageously brief candle 

Can I handle any of this alone

I don’t 

Know but the word Knowing is contained in the word Unknowing 

And then seeing Felix behind the blazing Five Suns of the Cafeteria Counter He says Today, I can have any Thing I want 

I think about everything I’ve ever wanted as sitting, Righting under what’s Left of that autumn Tree 

Fingers draining of their essential vitality 

Yellowing 

Walled, walled garden, guarded, fingers sticking into right into the heart of the earth on Samhain trying to connect to something anything any 

One

Two 

Three 



David, Bear – I call him, or used to call him, Bear - he used to, or still, calls me Weasel – spelled like Ouisel – in the Otter Family – Other – Ot – Her – Her inside the Otter but so far outside the Family – He clawed his way into my passed made shifted shitty self-righteous ‘family’ – the four of us – Well, Unwell – Two of Them, attached to One of me, and an Other like me – Eden – Eden, you couldn’t even write that shit – but I’m trying – and as I try to catch it – like a fish – this Plaice – this salmon jumping – leaping – Garden – Guarded – Eden – She made – She makes just the most beautiful artworks out of shattered Mirrors – I should have looked straight into them and seen the screaming symbology – foreshadowing this fucking imbalance of dissonant so-called-collective Cosmogony. 



I want so badly to go 

To Leave 

As above, so below 

The note the meadow Left Writ by hand and hand and hand and everything and outstretched hand

I am trying to hold 

My self 

In these last forty eight hours 

Before I somehow have to find the money and strength to carry all these 

Wretched things 

I thought would carry me 

Back to 

Where

Home?

Bearly 

The landlord replies saying I’m not at liberty to share the outgoings associated to the seven

Septum 

Pounds 

Pounding like the crow I saw pecking with such gusto at the acorn violently violence opening, Opening through violence 

Violence to get to the flesh 

The Inner flesh of truth within the casing 

Suit case staring at me 

Filled with, half emptied with 

Spaces, Traces left 

Be

Hind

Sight 

Site of my Unravelling

As Above, So Below – Of Course, At my moment of resolve to leave, I am physically, financially made incapable 

If I can just

Get Back 

Get Through

Not Over or Under but Through 

This 

Shell 

Spiralling 

Eadem Mutata Resurgo 

Get back to Glasgow, whatever Load you must carry, you’ve been carrying it – I know you’ve been carrying it too – 

We are carrying each Other 

Who?

I do not know, but I do – 

You. 

You are me, in Truth 

A Salt and Battery, Grief has always Been 

Fuelling this heaving steam vehicle 

Up this mountainous molehill 

And that loving Labrador Mooring Boulder, Rolling, Holding Moss 

Earthed and smelling fresh like fruit 

In opposition 

Silly, Silly opening 

Time to close the books, close the books 

And look and the roots 

That lay a Head of You

And so, surrender to yet another ending 

River, Bending 

Colours, Northern, Lightning Wind 

Painting Numbers Felt Within 

No Time for Love No Time For Sin 

No Time At All, Paladin 

Parallel

Reed

Red

Read

Readied, Dead Headed, Bed-wetted, children, Garden Wing, 

One-winged-legged-injured thing

A circularly dangerous engagement

Ring.



Convincing myself in pockets

In pockets of pockets of pockets of drop-stiches of pockets 

Of time 

To relax here 

But the Axe here 

The Axel 

Of the Wheel of the turning of the Screwball of Gums bleeding answers of root canalled anal-fissured bleeding in rhythm with broken broke breaking heart over and over and through 

I’ve got to get 

A

Gain 

Through 

Got to stop trying to find rhyme or reason in this Fallen falling fall season 

I think, again, in circles,  of Borges – His infinite library 

Lovely (where have they been for these whole 28 days) 



Just met them this morning 

Like a beacon 

Like a 

Light 

Saying 

What can I do for you

Right now 



Want to go for a walk 

After your bath 

And I think 

Amira 

A mirror 

Amira - Arabic - princess or leader 

beautiful princess disorder



A 

Mirror 



The name of my character in my novel: Nima, as in, Anima

Holy! Oh! Lee! Meadow! Meadows! Edinburgh, Satan’s Call get beside thee! Scotland’s Widow! Calling! Doe! Jo! The Sweetest, Poisoned ear! MacBeth, Brief Candle! To Bee, and Not Be! Hamlet! Breaded Ham, Bred Pig, Squeals, Please Cease! A Female Deer! Oh Dowager! Tao! The Way! Back! Spine! Reed! Read! Book! Back to Spine! Back to Back! To me! Two! Three! 

Divinity. 





On the walk 

I find out, this sweet messenger of the Gods 

They/them pronouns

I pull a card

It’s the moon 

Of course it’s the moon 

Scarab beetle placed right in the middle and I look to my left and there’s a VW beetle and bookending the beetle are two towers built to tumble through the trees but not this one not this one knot this one 

I look up at this tree I have dedicated, daily tears shed broken bread, writing unheard words save the tapping of keys as a locked shed, head-resting, red robin-robbing breath, bear lee breathing bent knee seething pain giving falling life shelter, an altar 

to Adrian, unaltered in Peace,

in pieces I look up to the reaching 

of branches above me - 

And in 

icy 

cold air 

I see 

pluming in spiral rails, to dissipate in the wake of the infinitely sparsity 

The One Loving eye Against Hundreds of Argus wound up and about me  

The form, formed through years, incalculable by any mortal means – for everyone Here, for hearing if they’d just –

Be 

Within the branched artwork of unloaded Arms of artillery beholding me

And I see an initiatory letter, a novel, formed epistolary:

A 



Adrian, I know you sent Amira to me 

And they are you and they and you 

And I

Aren’t me 

But each Other 

In Othering 

In Out group psychology, what a farce, what a scene, 

What a scene within scene I have concocted, no screen, 

But veiling the truth like a roof to protect thee 

IO share with Amira some segment some figment of grief, 

Sat opposite, mirrored in skin and wood and earth fire water air gravity 

Allowing, allowing our surrender to either side of this bench 

Saved 

Damned 

A membrane between and remembrance of the black queen 



My shadow Self, Aries, Aryan, Mars, Masculine, Unwarmed flask of unasked question in this chesterfield mushed room made of concrete 

And the grate at my feet every night while I’d sleep, Six lines intersected at three points in the middle, a literal hexagram, the whole month spending all of my might fighting men I’d crowned Kings, 

This simple but shattering Glassed over under gone somehow unseen, a message in the unending breeze - from the aegis, ageless ancient archaic I-Ching:



 

Hexagram 41 is named 損 (sǔn), "Diminishing", "lose", "reduction", "remove", "damage", "decrease". Its inner (lower) trigram is ☱ (兌 duì) open = (澤) swamp, and its outer (upper) trigram is ☶ (艮 gèn) bound = (山) mountain.



There was no Making Masks on Halloween, we’d already made them, we were making them, tearing them up, burning them with not a candle in sight or allowed 

They may have taken my candles, 

But they can never 

Take my light 

They may have blocked my access to the chapel 

Stopped me playing the piano

But they will never 

Hear my 

Sound 

These Signs

This Sine Wave Waxing, Waning, Waving Goodbye 

Too proud for procession, or ancestral release 

They all just tried to take over my body 

I tell Amira the quote we shall not cease from exploration. And the end of all our exploring; will be to return to where we started. And know the place for the first time. 

As I share this with them, I hear the buzzing of a Bee in the normal place, where I’d contemplate my splintering Selves of solitudinous lunacy

But then, another 

Another Bee 

I’d never seen two, for the entirety of my stay here 

I say to them, All of life is harmonics, spiralling, everything a dance of becoming, photographic album cyclical music -

I stay Hear, in the symphony of symbol of Community

With a wet, whetted scrying smile, I say “you’re the first person from my community I’ve met here”

Amira says, with their own smiling Spark to my Dark- 

As a mirror

 “Same here”

Of course it was the fucking Moon card.

The Bee 

B

Break is over, they tell me 

Mine’s just begun I joke 

Thinking of Dr Shanahan’s earlier quote about joke

Back to my room

I look closer 

(inside Closer, Loser, inside Lose, O, inside O, just space, just space) 

At the grating great grate laid before me – 

I kneel, as a wary pilgrim near the end of my expedition 

And look closer, under, through 

And see the Fourth Line, viewed from underneath, my hands planted so firmly all five fingers of each hand by hand by hand on the ground head turned neck craned seeing the fourth line’s other interpretation 

As closed. Hexagram 26:

Hexagram 26 is named 大畜 (dà xù), "Great Accumulating". Other variations include "the taming power of the great", "great storage", and "potential energy". Its inner (lower) trigram is ☰ (乾 qián) force = (天) heaven, and its outer (upper) trigram is ☶ (艮 gèn) bound = (山) mountain.

Graphemics. 

I want to discuss graphemic development, and what is the field of graphemics in terms of the roots, in terms of the history of graphemics and the evolution of graphemics, not etymology, like the actual symbolic or written calligraphic roots – routes- of words- Worlds- removed – Move - from their meaning. Graphemics is the study of written symbols and their structures in various writing systems. It examines how these symbols, or graphemes, function and evolve within a language. Graphemes can include letters, numerals, punctuation marks, and other symbols that convey meaning in written form. The field looks at aspects like the shape, form, and arrangement of these symbols.



The history of graphemics is intertwined with the development of writing systems. Early writing began with pictographs—simple drawings representing objects or ideas. Over time, these evolved into more abstract symbols. For example, in ancient Mesopotamia, cuneiform started as pictographs and gradually became a system of wedge-shaped signs. Similarly, Egyptian hieroglyphs combined logographic and alphabetic elements.

Logos – The Word – Was With – God – And The Word – Was The World – Was God – 

All alone – Alone – All – One

The Phoenician alphabet is a crucial point in graphemic development. It was one of the first phonetic writing systems, where symbols represented sounds rather than ideas. This alphabet influenced Greek and Latin scripts, forming the basis of many modern alphabets.

Calligraphy, the art of beautiful writing, played a significant role in shaping the aesthetic aspects of graphemes. Different cultures developed their styles, from the flowing scripts of Arabic calligraphy to the precise brushstrokes of East Asian calligraphy.

Children of The Voice Divine 

As writing systems evolved, so did the study of graphemics. Today, it encompasses the analysis of digital typography and the impact of technology on writing. In essence, graphemics bridges the visual and linguistic aspects of written communication, exploring how symbols carry meaning beyond their phonetic or semantic content. Would you like to delve deeper into any specific aspect of graphemics?Originally, “J” was a variant of the letter “I.” In medieval manuscripts, “I” was often written with a tail when it appeared at the end of a sequence of ones, eventually evolving into the distinct letter “J” used today.

The letter “Y” traces back to the Greek letter upsilon. The Romans adopted it into the Latin alphabet to represent sounds not native to Latin, especially for words borrowed from Greek.

Halloween – Samhain – All Hallows Eve – confronting the unknown – Revelry – Mischief – Old French – Meschief -  Misfortune or Harm – Meschever – To Come to Grief – Mes – Wrongness, Negation– Chief - Head, End – Never can there be an Edge nor Ending - Dead Head  - Worthless Remains - Caput mortuum (Latin for “dead head” or “worthless remains”) refers to the substance left over after a chemical process such as sublimation or distillation, where the volatile components have been driven off. This alchemical term symbolizes the residue that no longer holds value and has traditionally been associated with finality and decay.



In alchemical symbolism, it is often represented by a stylized death’s head or skull, emphasizing its association with death, transformation, and what remains when all essence has been extracted. The idea of caput mortuum aligns with themes of spiritual alchemy, signifying the stage where one has shed all that is unnecessary or false, revealing the essential nature beneath. It’s considered both the end of one phase and the potential for rebirth or the start of a new cycle, much like the Nigredo phase, where decomposition paves the way for purification and new beginnings.



In artistic and historical contexts, caput mortuum also refers to a deep purple or brownish pigment, sometimes known as “mummy brown,” that was historically created from ground mummified remains. While it has since evolved in composition – Decomposition - the name – the Holy Name – The Face – The Voice –

Twenty Nine in Numerology 

In numerology, the number 29 is considered a complex and powerful number due to its composite nature. It is often associated with deep insights, relationships, and spiritual growth. Compost – Composite – Sit Down at Earth’s Feet – and Hear - Here’s a breakdown of its significance:

The number 29 is made up of the energies of 2 and 9. 2 symbolizes partnership, balance, diplomacy, and sensitivity. It is about working with others and finding harmony. 9 represents spiritual awakening, humanitarianism, completion, and wisdom. It embodies a selfless, giving nature and is tied to higher consciousness. Together, 29 carries the essence of intense emotional and spiritual work. It can signify a journey where personal growth and the understanding of others are intertwined. It often represents learning through relationships and overcoming emotional trials to achieve a greater sense of spiritual purpose. Reducing (2 + 9 = 11), gives 11, a master number in numerology.

Master – Baiting – Crab – Cancer – Metastasising – In the Blood of the Coven – Ant – Hill – Kicked Down – Should be Revealing – Teeming Team, Community But Where Are They – Missing -  Mistress – Mistress Fae – My Pseudonym of Sin - Number 11 is associated with heightened intuition, spiritual insight, and a deep connection to the metaphysical. It acts as a bridge between the conscious and subconscious, symbolizing enlightenment and the role of a spiritual messenger. This reinforces the idea that 29 is not just about relationships or emotions but also about tapping into a higher purpose or understanding.

People resonating with the energy of 29 might experience intense emotions and face situations that push them to develop resilience and wisdom.  The path of 29 often involves overcoming obstacles to integrate the cooperative, nurturing energy of 2 with the profound wisdom of 9. This can mean learning to balance personal needs with selfless service.

Overall, 29 in numerology suggests a path of profound learning, where relationships, spiritual insight, and personal growth are central themes. It is a number that embodies the journey of turning trials into wisdom and learning to harmonize the material and spiritual aspects of life.

And then Sweet Amira 

Princex 

Comes Tapping, tapping at my hearth Heart Chamber soon not to be my door – 

And I read to them a segment – Section, Ending 

Of this piece of ceaseless script, bare and bearly any breath left 

When in the midst of Ovum’s oval misted Spectacle of text

To my left – 

Out through the closed glassy pain 

Right out out into the opener fronting façade place, 

Where cars, not parking parallel but temporarily stay and swerve around a roundabout and 

Holy Cradle 

Of real heart-pounding rift of Sound

BANG – a Gift! Of BOOMING INTO BEING 

Fire

Wyrd

Fireworks louder than I’d ever been 

Or Heard 

Or Been Heard or Seen 

The Colours hidden behind the trees but Wow, Oh How LOUD 

Were these Spectres of Exploding Volcanicity 

Suffering Servant Sun of Dog That Peered Upon the Bearly Breathing Scent, The Occident - 

An incidence – an intersection – memory with meaning

Coinciding with 

Oh 

thunder and lightning is no lark

When Dublin city is in the dark

So if you've any money go up to the park

And view the zoological gardens

Walking out to the Walled guard End Garden 

I see the giant Chess board, now complete, in the midst of a game, the Black queen though, miraculously, serendipitously serene in exactly the same spot, by chance or knot, the machinations of the unknown players had laid their pieces accordingly, leading to the same placement of this feminine symbol of the Unconscious I had built during my time here (and between the white pawn’s head and body, a singing note, which, though ink was bleeding, the hollowed neck, filled with water, yet emptied somehow hollowed, hallowed harrowing, still reeding: Luke 12:2-3, Mark 4:22 – kept there, flaccid, placcid, pallid, bust of White Bucked Palace, Tucked in Bed beside an unlocked Safe then, Safer now, just as Safe as Sound round which the message, meddling, had ever been – plainly, sighted, standing still, perhaps not taken or understood fully - 

Had I unravelled, unreeled, peeled off sacred layers of everything? Was this all my – 

No. No more. 

Just One Oar, I row in circles, – I row this boat, not sinking, not syncing anymore – Floating A Way of my Own 

Becoming

We went out there to see the zoo

We saw the lion and the kangaroo

There was he-males and she-males of every hue

Up in the zoological gardens





The two Girls I’d tied threads with 

Gifted a weathered feather each

Unbeknownst to me, Just Yet, were cowered and frozen, ‘neath the tables in the General Lounge 

The place where a woman’s life had ended – room filled with hues of Crossings, Cross, Knowhere, Gnosis- Sisterhood- Hooded witch sits under the Yew Tree Just Over -  

There.

Lindsay messages saying Just Checking In and I reply with 

Just – Check – King – Inn

We went out there by Castleknock

Says she to me “Sure we’ll court on the lock”

Then I knew she was one of the rare old stock

From outside the zoological gardens



Triggered by the loudness of this event, 

The Vent Has Two Opposing Meanings 

Lindsay has replied by now, saying 

For an Up – Date  - that makes no sense but I will never have the Nima Brains

Oh, thunder and lightning is no lark

When Dublin city is in the dark

So if you’ve any money go up to the park

And view the zoological gardens

I see his form, my shadow approaching 

I, his shadow, On All Saints day under a yew tree I am sending a message to Lindsay, The Meadow, Opening

Clearing

Eye

I reply to Lindsay beneath the Yew Tree with something far too verbose about the symbology of Dates – Prophet Muhammad – and Date Palms – The Sun God Ra – and Palm Trees – Victory – 

Vicky is in the General Lounge playing the C-missing scrabble which Amira had invited me to play mere minutes ago to which I politely declined (I have never, ever turned down a game of Scrabble in my life) – What on ore off of Earth is Happening tonight?

-and Triumph (where in my birthplace, Coventry, The Triumph Motorcycle found its genesis – Genesis – Christian iconographic Symbol of Peace and Eternal Life and Martyrdom – the Palm Tree, symbol of Eternal sacrificial Queendom, Dominion – Dates are seen as nourishment for the Body and placed ‘fore the soul – To Draw on One’s inner resources and resilience – In Many Traditions, Esoteric or otherwise, Dates were used in burial rituals as a food source for the long and Arduous Journey To The Afterlife – The Katabasis and Anabasis Entombed in One Seed-Womb Fruit -  and the Date of my Leaving being this Monday coming which is the Moon’s Day – Monandæg – Selene – Luna – Luna, See – Máni (who, during my attempt at a PhD had throttled me outside a club on New Year’s Eve) – Chandra – Chandelier – Lighting the Way – Thoth – The God I didn’t know yet, who appeared to me in a vision wearing a pinstripe suit and pointing at a Golden Altar – Suggesting to my subconscious that it was time to alter my physicality – Become the Rebis, Alchemy, Nectar of thee- 

We went out there on our honey

moon

Reaching, this newest, novel, Moon.





Says she to me “If you don’t come soon

Callum finds me in the garden, as I hear the music of his, of my 

Becoming, 

Omen

Lindsay says Woah. I type, strongly, Thank you for all this. Thank ewe, you, U as in the shape of a crucible as in the symbol of trans(?)formation of Becoming and she replies London would love YEW and I howl back under this invisible absence of Her – connected through technology, the interface of the Ineffable F for Female through the Omnipresent Moon – \

Oh, Men –



I’ll have to get in with the hairy baboons”



Entombed within these now-familiar walls, War, Supposedly Over, the Garden Still, Walled, Each Yellowing Whiteness of Brick as a Septum – It is Seven – Seven PM – Post Mortem – Cutting apart the body of what I’d built here, so erroneously, perusing and regarding the garden where in my enclosure I’d tried to forge an exit of Forgetting Into Netting webs of Symbols through these Chess pieces, Lindsay’s reply to my characteristic tangential knotted aegis-esque mess of a message was reflected back to her purest Lovely Mirror pathway through leading to Light as follows:

Thank you darling maybe after all this I’m read red reed Reid Ready-



Up in the zoological garden

Peace in Chest now Washing Over, Under, Over, Warping, Weaving, Weft, Wafting the scent of Lavendar, Lavish – Love; Is coming – 

Says she to me “It’s seven o’clock

And it’s time for me to be changin’ me frock

Each Chess piece is a Tarot Card, or, More, or less, or more or less a Crashing Wave of a Cymbal, Crashing louder in its unheard herd melodious black and white hue more colourful than any gunpowder, empowering youth with Crone-like Knowing of the Truth –



For I long to see the old cockatoo”



Callum says: The Two Girls Are Really Frightened By The Fireworks and I Think They’d Like To Speak To Someone 

Up in the zoological garden

I say, calmly, where has this calmness come from – am I some kind of Vampyre – No; Fire; Fire –

“Okay. Is it specifically me they need to talk to?”



Says she to me “Me lovely Jack

Sure I’d love a ride on the elephant’s back



He looked confused, as if unarmed, or deflated, or toppled, or – deweaponised or the Northern Wind Taken Out of His Sails 

“Y..Yes? I think so”

So used to me rushing, running to the aid of Others as a Mother with no Mother of my Own, No more –

If you don’t get out that I’ll give you such a smack

Up in the zoological garden

I could tell they didn’t specifically ask for me, or at least, the sound was not birthed from throats of both of them, they were most likely nonverbal from such an amplified earthly reminder of the archetypal violence that so few understand but that bridge over which has become the Zeusian language of this witch’s Only, lonely Cymbology 

Fear – Reverence – 



Well, thunder and lightning is no lark

When Dublin city is in the dark

So if you’ve any money go up to the park

Paralleled Footed, Rooted, Knowing Now the Ground upon which, Over, under thunderous throughput putting green I stand. Telling Callum all right, I’ll follow you – he turns around, seeming satisfied, re-glued 

In a final play, no game left, this bird I Am says:

“You Go Right, I’ll go left – how fitting”

He remains silent, still walking the straight path toward the door to the Inn-Side

As I leap delicately from paving slab to paving slab in my flimsy slippers too small for my transgender feet, 

I share with him the etymology of the two dual directions 

“Me, Sinistral, you, Dextral,”

Laboratorium – We Shall Not Cease From Exploration 

“Did you know that’s the root-“ route “-of the words sinister and dextrous?”

He says “No.” Certain in his uncertainty. 

My path takes longer, but it’s prettier, more delicate and it winds and winds like a wyrm 

A dragon, how this time has Dragged On and Off and On and Off and Vibration is everything in its Own Becoming 

Hole again

In my coat pocket – Barnabie, you’ll never sew my clothes again 

Samhain 

You showed me answers I never even considered 

Slithering 

Serpentine 

In get inside to find the ladies underneath the table 

Sarah – Princess – Reaches out her hand and I hold it – Ciz remains frozen as I comment on the beauty of her Silver – the Metal of the Moon - bangles – kneeling down at this level from angles I’d not regarded this guarded star of a woman before - 

I’d not seen her adorned with this jewellery before 

Gently caressing Sarah’s left hand with mine, Vicky is suggesting a little gentle meditation music and the room is slowly flooding with other women (John has long since left- no trace) – tracing thumb to back of hand I’ve come to know so well I feel the pulse of hers on mine and there is an exchange, a changing washing over her but I remain the same, I feel resolved in this horizontal plane 

I don’t attempt to make contact with Ciz’s frozen form, and that’s absolutely okay 

Eventually 

Ciz lifts the blanket – Mother Mary – Tears of Magdalena Baptising her lovely face – I make a joke that’s something like There’s that gorgeous tortoise! She smiles for a lightning flash, firework pop of face, and then it’s gone and she says 

I need to leave 

And then she leaves that place 

And that loss of presence, a gain, is okay – She was overwhelmed by all the Bodies raining taking up the oxygen and Vicky, sweet triumphant strong in vulnerability elephantine not in size or shape but definitely large and oh so strong of Heart Vicky shares that she is also struggling but helping others is helping her 

I regard the differences in all these women’s connection to One an Other 

I realise it really is time for me to leave, too 

Two 

The three

Becoming 

Two 

It’s time for me to leave 

The love – The love is in the leaves – the love is in the leaving 

All these lost lovers washing over me 

But dry, my eyes, dried roses, rows of gnosis, growing thorns no blooms just yet, just be – 

Just tend to your Own unguarded garden 

Expecting No thing in Return 

And in the Urn of realising 

Burns the Singing Lark – 

Once-Dove 

Callum

Says as I leave

“Thank you for trying”

I reply:

“Hey. All we have is trying”

I open the door

Out
