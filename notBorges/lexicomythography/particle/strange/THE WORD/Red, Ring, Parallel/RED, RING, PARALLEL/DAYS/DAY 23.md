DAY TWENTY THREE 
Waking me from slumber 
I thought I heard a thunder
A blooming boon of blunder under light of chamber door
But grumbling out to C’s throat’s oar
no, 
Still alone here, nothing more
Except 
The holy knowing of the embers of transgender ancestors
Forever trees are felling 
And silently to my ear yelling
My immortal family telling 
tales of senseless hatred they’ve resisted millennia heretofore 
Nevertheless, although broke, twisted
she and he and they persisted, 
Nima, Noam, Calliope I am kindling
Yellowed scripts, encrypted paper, my own sibling, singing lore!

evermore
Ever

All the Money 
I
Owe 
Thinking about Mark bringing up his benefactor all the time
But also his shady job 
Shady, shadowy character
Shadow
And last saw him (after 
Knight of the fireworks 
How last I saw him he showed me pictures of them and he said they looked like something I can’t remember now it was something threatening and I said they looked like dandelion clocks memory and blood sucking tick tock)
And then 
My insurance policy was supposed to cover 28 days, 
Would have been nice to write some joke about the zombie film – medicating away actually justified instances of a contagious epidemic of Righteous Rage 
But alas, here I am,  in stead, leaving all my packing (no trauma unpacked really, except within the leaves of this tome, the only body of evidence of the injustices we’ve faced) 
I suppose I can make some play 
Production - Farcical – Faustian bargain – Money money money – It’s not funny – it makes the World go round and round and -  thought it was chess but it was monopoly – amory – amira – mirror – misery – Steven King – Queen – Back to Chess – Chest – Secret – Initiate – The Chalice – Trophy – A - Ward rounds – pork rinds – hind – Sight – eyes of Argus upon us – blinking light – power outage – outing disempowerment of vulnerable inpatients – impatience at the not-quick-enough-not-good-enough-sinking-quickly-sandman-ombudsman-budding-rose-comes into-blooming-blundersome – blooming blunders the name of the jigsaw, undone, untouched, but laying there in the so-called Female lounge for the entirety of my unsafe stay 

All the peace and lessons learned here, for the most part – done by me, 
Really, this isn’t intended as the self-righteous scripture of a martyr 
I’m just, finally, finding that my voice has validity 
We didn’t – I didn’t deserve this actual cruelty 
Not just here, 
Out there, 
In the 
creeping closer, what’s more
much less can I – can’t I – go out – stay in – stained and scared and I still need to do my laundry I stink 
I take two pairs of underwear and go to place them in the sink, dousing them with the rose and geranium bath gel I ordered to reception here and had to open in front of a nurse to prove it wasn’t something I could hurt myself with
But this hurts so much 
Besides 
I walked out of here to the shop more times than I could count to buy so many things and one time even disposable razors that my past self would have smashed the plastic surrounding and release those little slivers of release 
But 
Anyway 
Here I am, leaving

Hello 

I am writing on the final day of my stay here at The Priory, Roehampton. 
I am a transgender woman who has faced constant misgendering, multiple instances of unacceptable treatment, and an overall, underlying manifestation of bias (whether unconscious or not, at this point, it has been absolutely undeniable) 

There are a number of fantastic employees who, as individuals, have been a shimmering example of hope amidst this darkness, but overall, and this is no exaggeration whatsoever, the lack of care in this establishment has been entirely astonishing and abhorrent. 

In my first week here, I faced an instance of sexual harassment by one of the male patients, who, as we all are, is of course going through his own journey of recovery and I do not by any means place any blame or accountability upon him personally. The point is that the structural inequality and inefficacy of this microcosmic establishment mirror (and even compound, concentrate) the macrocosm of the outside world which I am put face to face with every day. 

Not just this, but there were a number of staff members whose artifice and societal bias shone through and stuck out like a gangrenous thumb with an exposed bone of hatred - actual racist comments about the spiritual beliefs of entire communities, delivered with a sycophantic, falsely positive tone that genuinely made me sick to my stomach and not want to even interact with as a result. I will not mention these individuals by name. The point is, again, these people. Require. More. Training. 

Every night, as a result of both the initial incident (which I eventually reported, having processed somewhat utilising mostly my own cathartic methods of creativity, developed through a life of adversity - the therapeutic techniques offered here barely scratching the surface) and as a result of the niggling, gradual chipping away at my psyche thanks to the negative responses of the staff to my actual existence (coming up against multiple "what now"s, physical turning away as I tried to approach in the corridor, the only instance of pressing the call button in my room during a particularly bad meltdown, which took so long to receive a response to, the resultant, very late response being one laced with the underlying tone of huffing, annoyance and even at points disgust at my request for the help that I deserve as a human being) I simply stopped asking for help. 

I do feel I have learned so, so much during my time at the priory. Most of it has been through negation. 

My 1:1 therapist, Frances, is an absolute shining star of therapeutic methodology, my psychiatrist, Dr Shanahan, such a brilliant clinician, as are Stanford, Risq, and Hind Akooly. Hopefully you will forgive me for not knowing all the staffs full names, the internet access here has been abysmal for the entirety of my stay, so I have had to use my phone's hotspot, resulting in even greater debt, and this month I cannot make my rent payment, due tomorrow. 

One thing the therapy here did teach me is that anger is a result of boundaries being crossed, and besides the literal physical boundary crossing that happened as a result of the lack of mindfulness afforded to the placement of patients (I understand entirely that everyone here, particularly those on the front lines of care, are under so much pressure to deal with such complexities of intersecting presentations and needs - but this goes far far beyond the scope of any individual, right to the top) 

Speaking of which, bumping into the director during an almost two hour (I timed it) outage of power was enlightening to say the least, which was an incident entirely known by the management, as the cafeteria staff alerted me right before it happened that "[I] might want to choose a cold breakfast, as the ovens are about to lose power", and, speaking to fellow patients from other wards, I was made aware that they actually received a warning of the outage. No such warning was given to us in garden wing. 

During these more-than-one-hundred-minutes, there were vulnerable patients (thinking especially of those sectioned under the Mental Health Act here) who went without clean running water or electricity. I asked the Director, with my (quite forcibly) new found resolve to not accept poor treatment, quite calmly, though healthily assertion, as we all, especially women in such an inequitable, should be empowered and emboldened to embody "do you have a timeframe on when the nearly-107 vulnerable individuals, many of which are unable to leave, will have clean running water, which is a human right?" he replied that he'd "just walked into the building". 

Well, then, frankly, I found myself repeating (to myself this time) the three words which seem to have resonated throughout the years of hallowed memories of my exceedingly difficult life:
"Where were you?" - lo and behold, 20 minutes later, the cafeteria staff were handing out bottled water. 

Bumping into, by chance or by divine providence, the same man following this, he told me proudly that "[he] had facilitated that", as if the meeting the literal bare minimum of human rights should be met with gratitude, when the supposed worth of staying here is within the range of 4000-6000 GBP per week. 

Luckily, I was not detained, and managed to walk around the corner to the shop to buy a bottle of water. 

Earlier in the week, being too afraid to leave my room as a result of the consistent evidence that I simply was not truly safe here, despite efforts of many of the staff to convince me otherwise - I had resorted to drinking water from my bathroom tap, which resulted in very bad digestive symptoms that I will not gross you out with by writing(!) 

And, at the risk (Risq? wahey!) of being painted as an unreliable narrator of my own story, as so often happens with psychiatric patients, I eventually ended up walking around with a (turned off, battery removed, not functioning) field recorder. Miraculously, and as expected, this led to a sobering coming-to-presence by many of the staff members, and by a number of the male patients who, as a result of the lackluster boundary-setting by the poorly trained (no fault of their own, it bears repeating) night and weekend staff members, had wandered their way into the Female Lounge, supposed to be a safe communal space for women, many of whom have also been consistently misgendering me, but I do not blame them, we move on, I move on, and I am unfortunately very relieved to be moving on from this place, not really any healthier, but much more resolved to make a difference in this world as (whether I like it or not) a Gadfly. 

I was happy to see the patient advocate (even though it was three weeks into my stay) - I do not know if she recorded anything that happened as she didn't write anything down in her notebook during our meeting, but she was truly lovely and I'm sure she was just doing her best to be present for such a complex and gargantuan set of grievances that I have been faced with here.

When I finally (two weeks after reporting the incident) saw the social worker / 'safeguarding team', I was told, like a rug woven with the same threads of bias I've come to know so well, being pulled from under me once again, after the exceedingly welcomed sympathy and finally feeling I'd been heard, to "remember that there are people here with even more problems". This type of inter-patient comparison is absolutely not appropriate, particularly for a member of the safeguarding team! I really do not want to go around in circles here, but the intention of this written complaint is not to enact any sort of disciplinary action against any of the individual staff members, bar perhaps one, who sits at the very, very top of this Orwell-kafka-chimera-pastiche-production of a farce.

I make no apologies (anymore, thank you boundaries!) for my very rightfully felt sadness, disappointment and anger at the mistreatment during my stay here, as a result of the (I repeat) structural, institutional (pun not intended, but happy[?] coincidence) oppression that echoes the unsafety I face in the outside world. I simply have been shown that the staff have not been afforded the appropropriate support to provide the appropriate support required by a transgender individual trying to process her own trauma, which was literally repeated in the very place supposed to keep her safe. 

I will only briefly mention the difficulties of (again, maybe unconscious, perhaps not) misogynistic gaslighting faced by the other female patients here, because, as I have been told again and again (originally thought to be a diluted example of censorship, which perhaps it was, but now, for my own sense of peace, I'm taking as a means to protect my own boundaries and teach me the important lesson of such through quite literal exposure therapy) 

I am not at all happy with my stay at The Priory. I am very grateful for the support of the aforementioned individuals who did their absolute best within the black-and-white chessboard (very fitting symbology contained within the walls of the titular Garden of Garden Wing) of restrictions and societal power plays they find even themselves sectioned within, and I insist, with all respect that is due, that accountability be taken for such. 

Yours, worn-down-stone-eroded-faithfully,

Subject: Formal Complaint Regarding My Stay at The Priory, Roehampton

Dear [Recipient Name],

I am writing on the final day of my stay at The Priory, Roehampton. I am a transgender woman who has endured persistent misgendering, multiple instances of unacceptable treatment, and an underlying manifestation of bias—whether conscious or not, it has been undeniable.

While I acknowledge the dedication of several staff members who have provided moments of hope amidst this challenging experience, the overall standard of care has been astonishingly inadequate and, at times, abhorrent.

Specific Incidents and Concerns:

1. Initial Harassment Incident:
   During my first week, I experienced an incident of sexual harassment by a male patient. While I understand that all patients are on their own journeys of recovery and do not place blame on the individual, this incident highlights structural failings in patient safety protocols and awareness.

2. Inadequate Staff Training and Bias:
   There were multiple staff members whose biases were evident through their behavior. This included racially insensitive comments and an overall dismissive approach to certain beliefs, masked under a façade of politeness that was deeply unsettling. These behaviors indicate a clear need for more comprehensive training.

3. Delayed and Dismissive Responses:
   On one occasion, when I pressed the call button during a severe emotional crisis, the response was delayed, and when assistance did arrive, it was marked by irritation and thinly-veiled disdain. Such responses eroded my trust, leading me to stop seeking help altogether.

4. Power Outage Incident:
   The power outage, lasting nearly two hours, was poorly managed. Unlike patients in other wards, those of us in the Garden Wing received no prior warning. During this time, vulnerable patients, including those detained under the Mental Health Act, were left without clean water or electricity. When I inquired about the situation with the Director, his response, “I just walked into the building,” was dismissive. Only after this interaction were bottled waters distributed—a measure that should have been proactive, not reactive.

5. Access to Safe Drinking Water:
   At one point, due to fear and uncertainty, I resorted to drinking from the bathroom tap, which resulted in significant digestive discomfort.

6. Inconsistent Safeguarding and Advocacy:
   Although I was glad to meet the patient advocate, this happened only three weeks into my stay. The eventual meeting with the safeguarding team, though initially supportive, concluded with a statement that compared my struggles to others, undermining the validity of my concerns.

Positive Experiences:
   I must highlight the exemplary support from my 1:1 therapist, Frances, my psychiatrist, Dr. Shanahan, and staff members such as Stanford, Risq, and Hind Akooly. Their professionalism and compassion stood in stark contrast to the broader systemic issues.

Conclusion and Request for Accountability:
   My stay at The Priory has been a profound lesson—one largely learned through negation. While I appreciate the efforts of individual staff members who worked tirelessly within the constraints of an evidently flawed system, I insist on accountability for the broader structural deficiencies. The absence of adequate training and bias mitigation measures has led to an environment where basic human rights, such as safety, respect, and dignity, are compromised.

Given the severity of my experience, I request not only a thorough review and acknowledgment of these failings but also appropriate compensation to address the emotional and financial toll this stay has taken on me. This includes the impact of inadequate support, such as having to use personal resources for essential needs due to unreliable access provided on-site.

I urge The Priory to address these systemic issues and ensure that future patients do not endure the same hardships.

Sincerely,  
Callie Rose Petal


No, Noam, that’s so short and rigid, emotionless, I know you’re dead but where’s the poetry 
He tells me in formal correspondence such as this it’s best to keep poised and remain along the edge of clarity 
We work together this time, coming to, some kind of knowledgeable ending 
No affordable legal consort to console in, but, we are here still, my god, together, and thinking of sending:

Subject: Formal Complaint Regarding My Stay at The Priory, Roehampton

To Whom It May Concern:

I am writing on the final day of my stay at The Priory, Roehampton. I am a transgender woman who has endured persistent misgendering, multiple instances of unacceptable treatment, and an underlying manifestation of bias—whether conscious or not, it has been undeniable.

While I acknowledge the dedication of several staff members who have provided moments of hope amidst this challenging experience, the overall standard of care has been astonishingly inadequate and, at times, abhorrent.

Specific Incidents and Concerns:

1. Initial Harassment and Threat Incident:
   During my first week, I experienced an incident of sexual harassment by a male patient. This individual later escalated his behavior to transphobic remarks and a direct threat. After making an inappropriate comment, “I thought you were a nice guy,” and repeated appropriative remarks about being “a gay man that likes women,” as well as multiple instances of non-consensual crossing of physical boundaries with multiple female patients (who, while beyond the scope of this email, I believe have filed their own complaint), I asserted my discomfort and confronted him when he said, “trust me, I’m not a person you want to mess with.” When I responded, “is that a threat?” he dismissively said “oh, please.” I replied, “yes, please, stop,” assertively and firmly, as was suggested by staff members in response to the earlier harassment I reported to my therapist, who tried her best to escalate the matter to the safeguarding team. 

   I mentioned having recorded the interaction to convey my resolve and expose the gaslighting behavior. His immediate reaction—jumping to the legality of such an action without denying his threatening statement—was revealing. For clarity, the recorder was never turned on, lacked a battery, and was merely a protective device to invoke accountability in those around me. Under the *Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000* and related UK guidelines, recording in public or semi-public spaces for personal protection where only one party (in this case, myself) consents is permissible. This underscores that no breach of privacy occurred, as no actual recording took place. The mere mention of recording unveiled attempts to manipulate the narrative and demonstrated the defensiveness and dishonesty present among both patients and staff.

   Unfortunately, this same approach to self-preservation had to be used to address the inappropriate presence of male patients in the female lounge, which contradicted the hospital’s own welcome leaflet stating its commitment to providing “appropriate lounges” for different patient groups.

   While I understand that he is unwell and do not place blame solely on him, nor do I wish to involve police due to my own negative and equally discriminatory experiences with law enforcement and the desire to protect my well-being, the response from staff was inadequate. Despite being encouraged by staff to assert myself when uncomfortable, their reaction after the incident was dismissive, emphasizing that “he’s not well,” rather than taking appropriate steps to ensure my safety.

   This interaction was distressing and underscored the inadequacies in safeguarding protocols and staff training. Although I reported these behaviors to multiple staff members, their responses did not sufficiently address the severity of the situation.

2. Inadequate Staff Training and Bias:
   There were multiple staff members whose biases were evident through their behavior. This included racially insensitive comments and an overall dismissive approach to certain beliefs, masked under a façade of politeness that was deeply unsettling. These behaviors indicate a clear need for more comprehensive training.

3. Delayed and Dismissive Responses:
   On one occasion, when I pressed the call button during a severe emotional crisis, the response was delayed, and when assistance did arrive, it was marked by irritation and thinly-veiled disdain. Such responses eroded my trust, leading me to stop seeking help altogether.

4. Access to Hormone Treatment:
   It took over three weeks of daily requests for my estrogen patch to be added to the system. This ongoing delay culminated in an emotional breakdown where I was left on my floor in tears, experiencing severe menopausal and PMD symptoms due to insufficient access to the sex hormones that I do not produce endogenously. This delay in vital treatment highlights significant issues in the responsiveness and awareness of staff regarding transgender healthcare needs.

5. Disability Context – Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS):
   I have Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, a connective tissue disorder that affects the entire body, leading to chronic pain, joint dislocations, and digestive issues. The ubiquity of connective tissue involvement means that delays in care or inadequate responses can exacerbate my symptoms and cause significant distress. This context underscores why timely medical assistance and adequate treatment were crucial during my stay, making the repeated delays and insufficient support particularly detrimental.

6. Power Outage Incident:
   The power outage, lasting nearly two hours, was poorly managed. Unlike patients in other wards, those of us in the Garden Wing received no prior warning. During this time, vulnerable patients, including those detained under the Mental Health Act, were left without clean water or electricity. When I inquired about the situation with the Director, his response, “I just walked into the building,” was dismissive. Only after this interaction were bottled waters distributed—a measure that should have been proactive, not reactive.

7. Access to Safe Drinking Water and Physical Comforts:
   At one point, due to fear and uncertainty, I resorted to drinking from the bathroom tap, which resulted in significant digestive discomfort. However, I am grateful for the allocation of a room with a bath, which provided some relief on the many occasions I had to request painkillers and faced incredibly delayed responses.

8. Inconsistent Safeguarding and Advocacy:
   Although I was glad to meet the patient advocate, this happened only three weeks into my stay. The eventual meeting with the safeguarding team, though initially supportive, concluded with a statement that compared my struggles to others, undermining the validity of my concerns.

Impact on Recovery and Basic Needs:
   The emotional toll of these experiences has been compounded by the financial burden I faced during my stay. Due to inadequate support and limited access to reliable resources, I had to rely on personal funds for essential needs such as internet access. This added expense has left me unable to pay my rent, directly affecting my stability and ability to recover properly. Such financial strain only exacerbates the mental and emotional challenges that the stay was meant to address.

Legal Context – Equality Act 2010:
   Under the Equality Act 2010, individuals are protected from discrimination based on protected characteristics, including gender reassignment and disability. The Act requires service providers to make reasonable adjustments to ensure that individuals with protected characteristics are not disadvantaged. The consistent delays in addressing my hormone treatment, inadequate response to pain management, and instances of bias represent breaches of my rights under this Act. These experiences indicate a failure to provide adequate support and accommodations essential for my health and dignity.

Positive Experiences:
   I must highlight the exemplary support from my 1:1 therapist, Frances, my psychiatrist, Dr. Shanahan, and staff members such as Stanford, Risq, and Hind Akooly. Their professionalism and compassion stood in stark contrast to the broader systemic issues.

Conclusion and Request for Accountability:
   My stay at The Priory has been a profound lesson—one largely learned through negation. I have come to realize that my role in speaking out about these injustices, whether I wish for it or not, positions me as an advocate for change—a voice that challenges the status quo, even, and especially, in the face of consistent tone policing, so often faced by those of us at the intersections of marginalisation. While I appreciate the efforts of individual staff members who worked tirelessly within the constraints of an evidently flawed system, I insist on accountability for the broader structural deficiencies. The absence of adequate training and bias mitigation measures has led to an environment where basic human rights, such as safety, respect, and dignity, are compromised, leading to what I have experienced as breaches of the Equality Act.

Given the severity of my experience, I request not only a thorough review and acknowledgment of these failings but also appropriate compensation to address the emotional and financial toll this stay has taken on me. This includes the impact of inadequate support, such as having to use personal resources for essential needs due to unreliable access provided on-site.

I urge The Priory to address these systemic issues and ensure that future patients do not endure the same hardships.

Sincerely,  
Callie Rose Petal 



Looking back over this and the other 77474 now 5 now 6 now 7 - and probably more by the time this reaches the eyes of any other mortal – I think dear god, the ups and downs so incessant, how exhausted everyone who deals with me must be and then I think how do you think I feel and then I think who am I even talking to and then
Stop
