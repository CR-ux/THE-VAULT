*The Day of the Hunter’s Moon*

The power went out this morning. Including the filtered water dispensers. 
It went out at around 9am. It has now been 1hr 37 mins without fresh water or electricity in a hospital with 107 beds.
They said they’re working on it. This doesn’t feel good enough. When I drank the bathroom water a few days ago I experienced severe diarrhoea and stomach cramps. 
I just spoke to the director. He said they’re working on it. I insisted that the patients get access to clean water. He said ‘I’ve only just walked in the door’. Trying to stay calm. Do I escalate to social media now?
I feel awful for the nursing staff. I cannot believe this happened this morning. The cafeteria staff warned me that the power was about to go out, so they definitely knew this was happening, and the upstairs ward even got a warning. There should have been bottled water available for every single one of the 107 patients. I walked to the shop to get a 2L bottle, but there are so many patients who are not allowed to leave. There are also many, many patients with physical needs for which water is even more of a crucial resource. I am absolutely disgusted by the Hospital Director's response when walking past him "I've literally just walked in the building" ... 
well, why??
Where were you? 
Absolutely unacceptable. 
And the poor nursing staff had to deal with us all on the front lines, waiting for our medication because the systems went down. Absolutely atrocious, poor nurses, poor HCAs, shame on the director. For shame. I don't think I am unreaosnable here, I know I have my own trauma around oppression and that perhaps makes me more vocal or sensitive to such, and I'm sure the staff were all groaning hearing a trans woman make noise about injustice. But that's part of my therpeutic goals here. To challenge and assert myself for the very real and valid human being I am. I feel a duty to protect the even more vulnerable individuals here, while I know it's not my responsibility, who else is speaking up???? who else will???? I have nothing to lose, as always, it falls to the trans woman.
I have and will continue to document everything. And if the hospital staff are reading this, no complaint is anything to do with any of you lovely peeople. I have had nothing but the utmost care and compassion shown to me (obviously besides the ingrained bias leading to misgendering, but that is due to a lack of exposure to my community and I understand that. This is not what it is about. It is about basic human rights. Especially of those who have been sectioned

I don’t feel comfortable needing to comfort a man who is about to go into seizure without ‘positive speech’ around him, requesting physical touch, and rubbing his legs, making strange jokes, requesting I continue to rub his back, and then eventually his hands moving upward towards his crotch. I am not equipped to deal with this. Not after being raped. Not after trying to come to terms with the fact that I was raped. And my inability to say I feel uncomfortable, because what if he flips? What if at any moment he decides to come into my room? He is on observation – is this for his safety or for ours? He was not escorted when I arrived. And now he is. He keeps calling me beautiful and saying I love you. I say it back because I am genuinely scared of his reactions. He hasn’t given me a single reason to believe he would get violent, but I have no idea, and that’s the point, the point is that I do not know anymore, how to trust men, how to trust anyone, and here I am, trying to trust myself enough to say that this. Doesn’t. Feel. Right. 
And not even trusting that. 
But the threat 
The Threat 
 it’s the truth, 
Even if it isn’t going to happen
The mirroring, the immediate mirroring 
The immediate I Love Yous 
The immediate comments on my beauty 
The immediate questions about my surgeries 
I walk on eggshells my whole life to do everything I can to avoid harm 
This terrifying terrifying world 
Has something
In
The 
Basement 


Yesterday was such a good day 
I thought it was because I refused to accept anything other than light 
But I think now it was just the right timing of my meds 
And today I was unmedicated until 11am due to the power outage which WAS KNOWN ABOUT AND PLANNED. 
I feel this is a huge, huge miscarriage of care.
My first 1:1 session was a twisted ring on a can of tuna that cut open my fingers and left them bleeding bledding bleeding and all these coarse and so textured paper towel tendrils wormed their way in, in, in
I learned the same lessons the world has been bent on telling me and I have been bent on ignoring 
Or bent on trying to listen and in the trying not hearing 
Not hearing 
TO NOT HEAR ONESELF IS TO FORGET YOU ARE GOD 

I was told by the receptionist, after being told the day before (in the presence of the Staff Psychologist) that I should be able to play the piano at 4.  I count down the hours all day, through reliving my darkest trauma, counting down the time to be able to feel the keys. When it finally came, I was to come back to the chapel after 5. Probably because that was when her shift ended. I never did. The packages I ordered to the hospital reception arrived and the nurse sat with me and watched me open them; my childhood Christmases chewed, digested, regurgitated back at me, staining the crisp white pristine bedsheets changed that morning, colouring it with the Amber traffic light bile, leaving me empty. With no sense of excitement and not a shred of the childlike anticipation I once knew which now seemed a soaked cotton pad of a cloud of a memory of a fading dream, I sluggishly peeled back the adhesive sticker, which read ‘FRAGILE’ in the most alarming bright red. I opened each paper bag as the nurse watched, with a certain joy behind her eyes, perhaps reminding me of what it used to feel like to be enthralled by surprise, or perhaps I misinterpreted and the candle lit behind her compassionate lens was formed from the wax of worry. I vicariously allowed myself to feel both this amputated awe, and this alien worry for my Self, preserving all the wrapping, moving so slowly I could sense the nurse’s agitation. Time is moving differently for the each of us. The first package contained Rose & Geranium body wash. Facial Cleanser. Moisturiser. Makeup Wipes. Winsor & Newton Charcoal. An HDMI cable to extend my laptop screen, so I can more efficiently move through the DAW. The second package contained a pair of tweezers for my eyebrows and 6 disposable razors for my now-returning specks of facial hair, betraying the years of electrolysis and laser treatments, carried pain which once took my face from its pedestal of agony; and replaced by the heavy sack of sand of surgery after surgery; leaving nothing but numbness, nothing but numbness sprouting these old, black, grey, black, grey, inexplicably orange keratinous weeds from the shadowy lawn of the face I have tried to make my own. 
“I’ll put these in your locker” 
“Can I just quickly tweeze my unibrow? I know you’re busy it won’t take –”
“sure”
I stood in the bathroom as she stood in the doorway, the two of us performing the collaborative role of Janus, like kids stacked on each other’s shoulders in a trench coat trying to get into Olympus by assuming the disguise of a deity. 
I plucked whatever weeds I could in the time allotted and waved goodbye to the autonomy of never letting a single soul see my unshaven face in here 
I suppose this is what they call exposure therapy 




NIGHT SEVEN
On walking back to the ward from therapy
I was told to quickly come in
Before overhearing an upsetting conversation about my very close friend being sectioned again
So I tried to straighten my snaking spine and keep walking pretending I didn’t hear
Just get back to the room 
Just get back to room 17 where you can paint and cry and pace about the place without worrying that your pain is spilling out into the hearts of others 


She tried to stop me in the hallway, the same way I had tried to stop the hospital director in the morning 
And said she just needed somebody to show she loves her 
I have been trying 
We all have 
I tried to remember my script: 
“i don’t know how to say no in this moment without inadvertently hurting your very bvaloid feeelings which I hope you know I truly do care about. Right now, I am learning how to prioritise my needs so that I can regain enough strength to recover and be able to provide support appropriately and safely for us both”
But instead, grunting weeping sounds left my body and I ran away as she shouted, begging to get a cup of tea together in the cafeteria 
And so I spiralled into guilt, pleading, please, just give me some space 
She followed me to the door of my room, I asked who it was 
She said it’s a skirt 
Then I tried again
Having the piece of paper in my hand this time, reading the script loud enough through the door for her to hear it 
But She wasn’t hearing me 
She left the skirt on the floor
Where I then went, too, 
On the other side of the door 
This token of love, but this weight of being beholden
From my Self in Forty Years 
Desperately trying to rack up some sort of emotional debt or sentimentality wager
To ensure people don’t leave 
 But in the doing so 
Forcing them to 
Suffocating in guilt 
And I realise in all my anger at injustice, in all m y desperate trying to make the director see how vulnerable we all are, and how I refuse to stay silent – 
Not Forty Years, Forty minutes
I am her already
I get back to the room and my charcoal has arrived so I do my best to represent the desperate plea to be alone, and the subsequent transmogrification, 


Arachne’s hubris, thinking she can do all this incessant weaving and unravelling of such thick wax-coated yarn all on her own. 
 None of us can, not really. 
And so, my limbs filled with a deep lead
And I curled into a Fibonacci spiral atop my pillows, 
Like a cat, or an earwig 
Like a human-spider chimera 
Perched and puffing huffs of heavy hot air into my pillow
Trying to stifle the sound 
Somehow hours pass and I miss the time for dinner
The nurse tries to lovingly coax me out of the room to get me two packets of ready salted crisps and a mini box of coco pops
I try to sit in the patient lounge and play trivial pursuit with everybody 
I see the familiar wedges in unfamiliar colours under unfamiliar and unfriendly florescent lighting
The cards come out, I straighten them 
Hearing conversations I cannot relate to or even understand
The nurse asks if I was alright, mouth agape, snot trailing from my nose and eyes fixated on a distant point 
Not here 
She takes me to the clinic room and gives me the antipsychotic and the benzodiazepine
I sit with my mouth drooping slowly further into gravity
Gazing at the air conditioning unit like it’s a spacecraft about to abduct me to heights I was never aware of 
I curl into the examination table and a doctor comes in to tell me it’s safer to sit in the female lounge 
A new patient arrives
I hold the door open as best I can through the weakness in my arm 
I overhear the nurse say “this is the female ward” 
And in my walking past this new patient and her mother, I feel the most scolding looks upon the back of my head and hear: 
“…this is the female ward?”

Again, the membrane fuses over the doorway 
I veil one head of Janus
Consigned to not leaving, or to listening like a prey animal 
under the door, using my condenser mics to pick up any signs of hatred 
I try to have a bath to calm down 
The water runs freezing cold 
It must have meant to be this way 
Like with everything 
A reason, or else 
The Lord of Ruin 
The reasoning 

So, shivering 
 I sit here on the bed eating sugar packets
Having drawn down the hunter’s Moon

Surgery dream 
Drills being bored into shoulders. Elbows. Knees. Ankles. 
Nerve tissue being pulled out of the holes and feeling the sensation of funny bone snapping beyond point of capable to deal with 
Barnie 
Barnie coming back to an apartment that I was in 
Nithin
A demon named Nithin 
Shaped like a sphere with a hole on the underside 
Like a Weeble 
A dog 
A black dog 
So friendly s
She had 275 friends I said I wish I had so many friends 
Her owner said one day 
The surgery 
I was awake for 
Mostly awake 
The surgeon saying calm down calm down the opiates should help you 
Even though I was beheaded 
And looking at my own heart 
As he pumped some metal ball bearing through its chambers to test its inner workings

Dreams are coming back 
I drew down the moon
Sat cross legged on the cold damp concrete of the chess board 
I drew the holes in the wholeness of the moon in coal 
From her dizzying height, she is trying to send me answers 
as little rabbits
I am here
To hunt for them
All I ever needed was 
clean, 
running water, 
for us all - 
a gun, 
for food 
for the rabbits
