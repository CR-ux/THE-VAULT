DAY ELEVEN
Then, the song of a lark and a gentler, safer (?) knock 
Who is it? I whisper 
Nima could you open the door please honey? Are you alright? 
I dismantle the contraption, tears unavoidable, streaming, fledgling chest heaving, speaking through my weeping
I am now. I am now. 

Still. The pain in my neck. 
The phrase a pain in the neck really does not do justice to the tumult and turmoiling boiling and toiling sensation of a spinal syrinx in ones cervical spine, though it does encapsulate its phenomenology. 


“what now” the nurse says. Same response. Different Nurse. Same Nurse that seemed safe an hour ago. Different Day. But really. Same Day. Same unending Day of Night. Different Knight Under the Same Sun. 
In my mind, the response, screamed through a raw, raw throat:
“what now? God. God is now. The only thing that is real is now. But in the context of my reason for talking to you, the question should really be ‘what 24 hours ago?’” 
I breathe, actively attempting a lack of reaction to this latest habit of clear annoyance at my basic human request for care. In a hospital. 
I spool a smile on the outbreath, saying (gently, gently, Be The Sun, Not The North Wind): 
“Hey there, just wanted to acknowledge that I’m sure it’s hard to delineate between genuine expressions of pain and manipulative attempts to gain access to psychoactive medication, particularly opiate painkillers. But I have here my complete medical records-“
The look on her face is hotter than any conversation with my mother, any feeling in my neck, perhaps highlighted further by the freezing cold dryness of the air-conditioned clinical suite. 
I zoom into the medical notes from 2021 on my phone
MRI result: Enlarged spinal syrinx in C1/2
The nurse asks what pain relief I have been given over the weekend 
I breathe again 
Ibuprofen 
This kind of pain won’t be touched by Ibuprofen 
I know, I try to say calmly, stars flickering in my peripheral vision 

In the cafeteria, I am stopped by The Man from the Pagoda 
He tries to kiss my hand 
I pull my hand away without a word 
He, in a very cleverly chosen tone of pseudo-irony 
Calls me a Bitch. 

Back in Room XVII 
I see an almost translucent spider move across the brown, burgundy-stained carpet 
She is herself a gossamer 
A reminder, a warning against hubris 
I ask her if she’d like to be outside 
Using my copy of Plath’s Ariel 
I post her, thorax, abdomen, eight legs epistolary through the small gap I have been afforded in my bolted window, taking a moment to thank Plath for not making the work more verbose (even 20 more pages and this technique of arachnoid-escape would have been rendered impossible) 
Be free now 
I say 
Not caring about the shuddering thunderous cliché of a scene I’ve just been woven into. 
I open my body 
Sorry 
Copy of Borges’ body of work 
Labyrinths 
Dog-earred and bushy-tailed 
So well-loved 
And believe for a second, I’m in his arms while the Master himself reads it to me, 
In what I assume must have been a smoky, hushed baritone 
Fiction within fiction, story within story 
 A fractal brain just like mine 
I miss him, though I’ve never met him 
Through his words though, I meet him every night 
By this art you may contemplate the variation of the 23 letters 
I am stunned at the synchronicity 
(A Jungian term, another of my surrogate Fathers, I must have a veritable metaphysical polycule of creative Fathers) 
The 23 letters, my 23 pitches 
This microtonal scale that just keeps winding inward with no sign of stopping 
Was it ever going to go anywhere? Or simply turn deeper, deeper, like the tightening of a screw 
Becoming more and more itself 
And less and less everyone else  
Back to the nurse’s office 
I place my hand gently, flat against the glass panel in dedication to Thisbe.
The Pyramurse swats my visage away like a fly 
The resonance with Kafka is palpable, buzzing around the fecal matter of this place 
Another female patient stops me to ask if this is where I get my coffee 
I say, no, they don’t allow caffeine on the ward. But I’m about to go to the café at reception, where the precious nectar is hidden. I ask her if she’d like me to get her one
In the mode of the feminine scale, she sings a song that goes 
Oh no, 
don’t worry, 
I’ll just  --
I interrupt her (in spite of myself) saying
Tell me what it is you’d like and I will get it for you
The other patients in the lounge, fuzzy ewes waiting for the shearing, bleat their awes and oohs at this, really quite insignificant offer of kindness, as the woman says 
I know, he’s lovely isn’t h—
Catching herself, apologizing to me 
I have stopped caring 
I have resolved to stop caring 
And in the resolve, bolstered by the strength of the newfound mothers last night 
I truly have stopped, at least in this moment, giving power over to the perception of others 
Perhaps it is this work I am pouring everything into 
Completely my Own 
Which is making me Whole in its Own Becoming
I touch the woman’s thin, frail and malnourished arm, wordlessly, endless words in a single touch 
It’s not alright, but I know you’re not alright 
Nothing is alright 
Not here, Not out of here,
And none of it your fault.
And so really, it doesn’t matter. 
I turn around, head further above everyone else’s in my heels 
And ignore the twinge in my neck as I duck underneath the doorway, too restrictive for a woman of my stature 
Most of the world is, actually 
Waiting for a bus to go or a plane to go or a train to come or the rain to go – 
I collect the beige sacrament and bring it back 
Again, the gay male patient comments on my appearance 
I tell him, sarcastically (as I hear cats meowing through the opposite side of the TV screen):
It’s probably because I’m wearing makeup. You know you should really try wearing makeup. I bet you’d look lovely with makeup on. 
I don’t even think he understands that this is a reference to him. 
Quite strange, considering his respective heliocentric placement in his own universe. 
But perhaps this is the very reason why.
Perspective is everything 
Revolution happens about a centre of great Mass 
Communion. 
I walk back to the fish tank crackless breezeless unblown meltdown sand glass transparency sound barrier impermeable membrane – 
And ask 
“Any news on the painkiller?” 

I have read perhaps 7 different papers exploring facial recognition and perception in patients with EUPD; each utilizing fMRI methodology (quite insufficient and fallacious for a multitude of reasons, but I shan’t labour the matter here) 
And while somebody with my unsticking label of a diagnosis may very well perceive neutral expressions as negative (and I can definitely attest to this being the case many times in the past) 
I can say with absolute certainty 
The look on this woman’s face as she regarded my (I had entirely lost count at this point) request for very-much-so-desperately-at-this-point-necessary analgesia…
Was simply one of hatred. 
No amount of amethyst could keep out this onslaught, this psychic bombardment of artillery fired my way 
I surrender. 
I surrender. 
I quite literally hold up my hands, one now freed of the frail woman’s cappuccino 
And I walk back to my room to continue this work in pain. 


Outside, beneath a shimmering spiderweb (which I try my best not to catch in the tendrils of my hair) I am called by a nurse
Believing it to be a sign my pain relief has been granted, I breathe a sigh of relief 
“Nima, it’s your one-to-one therapy now”
Ah. 
“Thank you so much Ruth. Just wondering, any sign of that painkiller?”
She tells me that yes, it’s been prescribed 
I fight back tears 
Shall we get it after therapy, she asks 
I think, sure, what’s another hour after this countless string of blood red pearls 
But then, crossing the threshold to the therapist’s office, I nearly faint from the pain, almost knocking over the opaque ceramic head, covered in the Ordinance Survey contours of Phrenology – A Freudian Map To Nowhere
Ruth sees me stumble.
“I’ll bring it up to the office for you” 
Where you go, I’ll go. Where you stay, I’ll stay. Your people will be my people, and your God will be my God. 
(This isn’t just a solitary silent thought. I say it aloud -)
The high frequency background of the effervescence provides such a soothing white noise as the therapist asks me what has led me here 
For perhaps the first time, I feel able to speak about it without immediately crumbling
And I think about the concept of a take up reel 
A donation, an acceptance 
A give, a take 
An in, an out
An energetic exchange. 
That must be what’s happening, I thought 
My pharmacological salvation is dissolving in the cup beside me 
Allowing me to build some Form of Sense 
Of what happened to me 
And all it took was somebody Hearing The Fact That I Am In Agony 
And, finally, responding 
Appropriately. 
To the right of me are a multitude of coloured pens, paper, painbrushes – 
She knows my language. She’s speaking it. 
I’m hearing her hearing me. 
I tell the therapist (gently, gently, Be The Sun) 
About the Injustice that has occurred during my time here
Managing to remain composed enough 
My dynamic symphony ringing out truer that the rings of a tree felled in a forest far away enough for nobody to hear it 
Because It’s The Truth 
 Even if it didn’t make a sound 
 I tell her, (gently, gently, Be The Sun)
That more than one hundred vulnerable individuals were left without clean running water for two hours 
That I managed to remain assertive (not melodramatic) enough to get across this dizzying bridge that seems to have formed between my heart and the hearts of those around me - the very real miscarriage of human rights. 
That I had been quite literally (gently, gently, Sun Setting, Golden Hour, Dusk -) 
Begging 
For my physical pain to be recognized and treated 
I tell her 
That of course, 
Of course I have been placed secondary my whole life 
Because that is what I have been leading with 
Leading with Lack 
Believing so strongly that I hold no worth in comparison to others 
Living as a facsimile. 
Leaving the session, we pass another sculpture of a disembodied head (but this one transparent glass) 
I look at my phone and realise I have received a message from Lucy 
“We’re in the general lounge!”
The only other patient I have trusted with my number – a fellow artist, who has promised to teach me the ways of the masters, a self-directed oil painting class that I have (gently, gently, maybe not so gently) nudged her to hold, which couldn’t happen the day prior due to the immobility in my neck. 
Her face lights up as I call her Maestra 
There are two other patients in the room 
I may them no mind 
My goal is clear. My goal is flurescent yellow. My goal is this lemon that Lucy has lovingly placed on a table under harsh, equally fluorescent (but much less organic) light 
The tenderness of its positioning shows me just how much she cares about this practice. And by extension, how much she cares about me. 
For a moment, as I tie the apron around my waist (the thinness of its Form the first topic of conversation upon my entering the room, thanks to The Man From The Pagoda) everything shuts up, everything is still, as if the fastening of the apron is the fastening of my heartstrings 
Alas, I am pulled out of this Womb of a Sanctuary, Breached – 
Nima, the Doctor wants to see you 
Lucy protests, saying how long I have been waiting just to express myself in Layers of Burnt Umber and Titanium White 
The staff member points at my blank page and begins to say “I know, he –“
I (gently, gently, with a little heat) correct her
“She”
She quickly, (forcefully, coldly, with a gust from the North) tells me that she was not about to misgender me 
I say (no change in tone, timbre, dynamics or octave) 
Now. 
Everybody makes mistakes. 
But do not lie to me. 
She says, (colder, colder, faster, as I tighten my cloak) 
YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT I WAS ABOUT TO SAY 
I respond, warmly:
Do you?
She falls silent, shaking her head, and moves in to give me a hug
I hug her back and say 
It is not the very human mistake. 
It is the very inhumane attempt to lie to me. 
Please, do not do that again. 
Remaining washed with calm as my canvas stays unpainted, I turn around 
In my turning round the corner of this jarring White pseudo oasis, I realise, somehow, today I have turned a corner  
I even tell the psychiatrist my hurt at his use of the word ‘melodrama’.
I paint the first layer of my lemon, as Golden Hour shimmers through the tiniest space in the window (which has the concertina tubing of an air conditioning unit shoved through it)
Outside, Ciz sits with a bruise on her forehead. 
I am very worried about her. 
The Man From the Pagoda has followed me out here, and attempts with every pause in my speech to claw his way into the conversation. 
I pay him no mind as two magpies fly into the tree next to us 
I tell them both, as I salute these magnificent creatures twice, that the practice of reading signs from the birds was known as augury or more specifically Ornithomancy
That the etymological root of the word auspicious is grounded in this practice
I ask Ciz if she will join us in the lounge, that she doesn’t need to paint, just her presence is enough. 
She comes with us
The Man says she will ‘Light up the room’ 
I turn around, neck now mobile enough to do so without turning my whole body, 
And say actually, I think you’ll bring quite a necessary rich darkness that the clinical glare of the room has been missing 
And The Man spews some unsettling question about the location of the Womens’ Rooms.
I strategically place myself on the walk back to my easel, between him and Ciz. 
This doesn’t feel like a burden anymore
I have saved enough of the magnetic tape to reel some off to this girl, who so clearly needs to hear some sound reflected back to her 
To wind her away from This Man 
Who the both of us, 
The All of us 
Are clearly 
So 
Uncertain about. 
And perhaps (although I daredn’t even think it) 
Are right to be so.
