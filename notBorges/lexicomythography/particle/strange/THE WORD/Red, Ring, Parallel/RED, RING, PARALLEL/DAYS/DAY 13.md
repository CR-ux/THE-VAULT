DAY THIRTEEN 
A medical student stops me in the hallway 
Wearing scrubs embroidered with the logo 
Logos – The Word 
Of the medical school I didn’t quite get into 
I’ve been asked to take your History, he says, would you like to go to your room? 
I divert him instead to the Female Lounge
Where atop the table, the Trivial pursuit game still sits, unfinished 
History
Yellow 
Wallpaper 
I reel off response and observe him recoil as he observes me 
I tell him everything 
Pretty much everything
Do you hear voices, he asks 
Do you see things that aren’t there, he asks 
Instead of answering, I ask him in return if he had ever taken psychedelics 
He denies this 
And I wonder if he would have told me if he had, anyway 
Anyway 
I tell him, eventually, that my perception contains multiple layers 
I experience hallucinations, but I am aware of their so-called ‘un’reality 
I tell him about the Djinn 
As he floats in the corner, Lilith-looking 
Shy, this time 
Like he’s been found out 
I smile at HIM 
He smiles back 
He asks me about physical problems 
I tell him about the ways in which my body can’t hold itself together 
Laxity 
Laxity 
Giving way 
Petal after petal falling, renewing 
About my Clarinetting Minuet of a Central Nervous System 
Growing to light
At some point, after I have told this man the deepest turmoil and darkest secrets of my past 
I ask (and get an answer) his name: 
Mohammad 
I have these 
Thorns as teachers 
The garden forks, cuts, grows 
It grows, lush, tangled, impossible 
I 
M 
Possible 
Leaving the room, the HCA asks “are you okay” 
To the student 
(not to me) 
Eggshell existence 

Later, leaving the ward to soak a little Sun 
(Be the Sun) 
I aim to write freely 
With my ink 
To gain an inkling 
Of what sinking led me here 
What rising might be coming 
I see Mohammad and a fellow medical student 
Clearly discussing other ‘cases’ 
(Basket)
Reeds 
Reed 
Syrinx
Read
Old Norse Nema – From Proto-Germanic nemana – From Proto-Indo-European *nem-, *neme – To touch, seize  
Faroese Nema (thirdperson singular past indicative nam, third person plural past indicative numu, supine nomoi – to touch – to seize – to touch on – refer to – to make an impression, influence – to steal. To learn 
Icelandic strong verb – third-person singular past indicative nam, third-person plural past indicative námu, supine numio
To take – to capture – to mine (ore, coal, etc) – to amount to – to detect – to perceive – to study –
Augao er þaõ skynfæri er nemur ljós
	The eye is the (that) organ which detects light.
-to touch
I overhear whispers about the Man From The Pagoda 
The one who left this Stain on me 
This Stain on this place 
The female medical student says:
“But how do you know his fits are real?”
And Mohammad, the prophet 
Says:
“we don’t.”
Turning to open the drape just a little further 
A little more light 
A ladybird 
Crawling on my window 
Trying to get in 
Trying 

Claire asks:
Do you know where a table tennis ball might be? 
I say I have an idea who might have stolen it 
We find a cleaved plastic hemisphere underneath the artificial oversized toadstool mushroom made of concrete 
She then tells me the nurse is refusing to let her out the front 
(where the Sun is) 
Even though her daughter is visiting her 
I feel the exasperation in her usually-very-curated breath 
You know when you have a visitor and you just want to –
She begins,
I dissolve into dissociation like the effervescent painkiller I chased my medication with this morning –
Because while I understand, and empathise entirely, I do not know 
Not a single visitor 
My own mother, on the third day I was here, confirming her absence in totality 
Not even my own mother 
I walk to the nurse’s office 
Resolved to Resolve this 
Vicariously hoping to bring a Mother and Daughter into the Sunshine 
(If you Cannot Be The Warmed, Then Be The Sun)
The nurse, 
Called Harmony 
Of all things 
Stutters and stalls 
When I ask her if Claire and her daughter can go outside 
I walk away 
This is not my fight 
I’m not sure what is, at this point, 
Except surrender 
I did what I could 
I do what I can 
We do what We Can 
There Must Be Some Mistake 
I walk back to my room and see Claire’s daughter hovering at the doorway, like the dragonfly that came to see me under the tree an hour or so ago 
I smile and say Hi 
Closing the door on this lady, this winged thing 
Just 
Trying 
To get 
Out 

They manage 
Something about boundaries 
Something about a message 
Sent 
Saying 
Not my primates, but unfortunately our Circus 
They manage to get out 
And I follow 
A river 
South 
I think of the North 
I think of Athens 
I think of the Vending Machine 
Gathered in the last stitch of sunlight 
I find this hodgepodge family 
Plus 
The Boy Who Said He Wasn’t Gay But 
And his Mother 
I say 
Oh hello, nice to meet you, I’m Nima 
Silence 
She stares directly at me 
I lower my sunglasses and again, 
Repeat
Oh hello, nice to meet you, I’m Nima 
Seemingly stunned, she says 
Hello 
I lower my sunglasses and she continues to stare at me 
Unhuman 
Inhuman 
In pairs they all sit on these cardinal benches
But I have this wonderful legroom 
On this bench on my own 
Eventually, The Mother leaves 
It was nice to meet you, I repeat, A third Time 
The final syllable ringing out, red 
Silent 
Seemingly, hours pass 
She says Goodbye, nice seeing you all 
“Sure” 
I say 
Sure. 

Out in the Forking Walled Garden
I throw the disembodied head of the King into the lavender
