DAY 1 
First day in hospital. I don’t have it in me to journal what led me here. All I know is I am being called to make this sequel to KATABASIS.
Before making the incredibly arduous and Sisyphean journey down to London from Glasgow (apparently the hospital in my home city were simply not equipped to treat the complexity of what mess lies inside my skull) I made sure to record as many samples of live instrumentation as possible, knowing I wouldn’t be able to make much noise here on the ward.
I decided to utilise cassette tape as the medium primarily, both for its aesthetic beauty encompassing so much sporadic artefact, but also because of the incessant and exponentially inundating synchronicities following me, roaring out of me and flying back to me roaring like floodwaters –
Telling me, screaming to me, the importance of this medium -
Loops
Cycles.
I enter yet another cycle.
Dried roses
I suppose
It must be the dissonance again
Which holds the key to silence beyond harmony
I am screaming to a silent world bent on harming me
On the tenth night of the tenth month
Two days short of Shakespearean Farce
Prometheus’ fire
Cassandra’s prophecy
Of this cruel and barreling year I have faced
Of this cruel and barreling train of a life
On such unforgiving fractal tracks headed terminally fore
This distant house set ablaze under three decades of rain
Stained earth the only knower of such tears
Pain remains
Unchanged
Planting roots
Metastasising
Pain grows limbs
As eye
Disappear
Can’t we all just have a little more compassion for one another?
A IS FOR APPRECIATION PRIOR TO DEPARTURE
I AM
not
sick
no
I am
sick of fighting to exist
The psychiatrist comes into my room and sits at the desk, facing my shaking cross-legged shadow on the still-white bedsheet
Kind eyes, framed in bile-orange spectacles (really, quite gorgeous things to look through)
I tell him about my opinion on my diagnosis, how it feels like the modern day ‘_hysteria’_
He tells me I really must stop the melodramatics.
In my self-dismissing passive allowing allowing allowing cowtowing allowing;
I say yes, yes of course, how could anyone ever help me while I’m expressing this much emotion
And after he leaves
After the booming gravity of a male has evacuated the entrails of this room
Leaving the vacuum of what I am not too afraid to say to my Self
I think, silently -
About the walls.
_(Their yellowish hue)_
I think silently about the agony
Pervading every fleeting moment of this sickly twisted existence attempted in presence
Invalidation round every turn
Not only pain, but denial of the pain
As if the pain itself begets more pain
As if the ask for help precludes the gain
Of any sort of healing
Helping
Pleading as a padlock.
I must remember my role as curator
Curator of this endless ache
_Do you dare to stay out?_
_Do you dare to go in?_
_How much can you lose?_
_How much can you win?_
