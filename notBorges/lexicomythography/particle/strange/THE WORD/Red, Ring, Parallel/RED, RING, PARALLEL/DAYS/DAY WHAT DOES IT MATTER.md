DAY WHAT DOES IT MATTER
Undressed 
Red faced
I try to shake the two pairs of underwear with bunnies over the crotch
Where they kicked
And mythologies wound around all inside me, deeper, deepening
Hilda opens my bedroom door and I say I’m shirtless 
Your shirt you left 
She asks if I’m coming for breakfast I try to make some kind of lexicographic wordplay and only end up with Hi – L – Da and I’m disappointed 
I’m so sad and disappointed 
Walking to the morning daily mourning dawning darning my socks in the night 
She asks again if I’m coming for breakfast and I say I need to wake up first I need to have coffee and then she asks how I am and I say not great really I leave tomorrow and then a look of sadness whether real or fake I’ve stopped caring at this point washes over under through her face voice name and says she’ll miss me and I say okay and start crying and let it slip that I guess everyone around here’s getting better except me so childish  I think so I am capable somewhere of grown up thought in fact I always was and I think maybe that’s the problem or the solution or the dissolving acid alkaline basic basic basic human rights were broken here or am I just broke and lightning and darkening looking for something to crack in everything that’s how the 
Outside, a squirrel 
I follow him 
See another in a tree 
I keep my eyes on the first, keep following, round the hedge to under my soon-not-to-be bedroom window trying to make some sort of symbolic room in my broken heart I am so broke and raked and thgis place like everything and everyone else and me has taken just so much from me through injustice no peace no remedy except for silenced melody last night I sang in the chapel 
And then back through the garden wing I think again of the meaning 
Meanness 
Men 
And 
Then 
Walking past Hilda again I say I’ll miss you too you know and mean it
Meaningless, sometimes a place or a person or a person in a place hurts you for no reason 
Walking through Mark I make some sort of comment about the gates of hell I’ve really lost all energy and restraint through the restrictions in this place 
Callum asks me, in French, ca va?
Bottle of Cava thrown at my Father’s head 
Ca va Merde, Merci 
Him, the Moon, or Bear, 
Me 
The Sea 
Walk into the cafeteria I see Simi 
Full name: Samandeep 
The beloved Light
And I start crying once again when she asks me what I’d like 
And say in every darkness a bveloved light 
And she looks with such empathy and sympathy and says attractive voice remember to try to stay positive 
I ask her if she’s working tomorrow my last day and she shakes her head so I shake her right hand as iron and wine plays in my left ear (having removed the headphone from my right) 
Kabbalah 
Kali 
Be
Heady 
Ready 
Red-Thread-steady 
Go
Go
Go
Lost my bag 
With my Journal in it 
Journey rendered, for a string of pearlescent moments
Irrelevant 
The incessant and descendent need 
To be witnessed 
By the Goddess
I keep seeing her in my left eye 
Try my best to self regulate as the nurse says and he is right 
But all I can think like a locomotion of emotion dressed – red – red – red – dressed as thought – taut – skin, not moisturised, lamenting cries this gentle man is witnessing, missing him, paradoxically drying my unhidden hide 
Somebody is reading my diary 
I can feel it 
Trying to challenge negative thoughts challenging unhelpful thoughts 
Itching shoulder, my right – a sign
F5
Microphone button 
The Call, left unanswered, or – too late – too late 
Agate 
A 
Gate 
Amythest around my neck I take to the skies, or earth or wind or fire fire fire or 
I’m breaking in the nurses office crying braking in momentum this occasion this twice or thrice daily occasion always breaking never mending first to brake and last to get started start this engine end Djinn end Djinn end Djinn
Nothing Works Anymore
Tyring to turn to the page I can’t find it everything for a reason everything for a reason and absolutely everything an outstretched hand in
They say they’re phoning reception to see if someone hands my bag in
Nima – pack it in – you have to pack 
Just you and all your non-belongings, yet again
Aer blows turning leaves of pages open, open, opener and there – my sketches of Bobo
Opening my phone to paste the illustration in it’s 11:11
I thought the second group therapy notes would be before the one that came first 
The thirst of the tree I feel her so I pour a little water from by bottle – blue – the only colour they had 
My lighter, green again 
Bumps sees me in my panic asking what am I looking for, my lighter? I handed it into reception would you like it I say no give it to Carolyn they won’t let her have one and the double standards in this place are doing my head 
Out
Where I dance in desperation around this tree, of yew, of me, of Oak and Ash and dust and leaves I take my socks off undarned, Knight of roundest rectangular picnic table and the spaces in between to see through right and left behind right through them birds are chirping and I see through the gaps and circle in the middle, hole, a spyglass, I am, Alice – wondering 
Wander through the leaves bear-footed 
No thoughts of trapping, leaving oh too soon but just on time and far too late and leave me alone I can’t sit down I’m banging boonless all alone at Heaven’s gate 
Josh says you are doing well and I say really am I? he replies you’re doing everything you can to self regulate 
Edit – Copy – Duplicate 
And paste:
It’s not working, for some reason, I know knot Y 
Shaped branches above me the squirrel watching as I dance 
Bare footed, cold, so cold no blood left in my toes 
This petal-peeling dying winter coming blackened once red rose 
Control 
Vee 
Vin 
That dream, whatever could it mean 
Memory 
Maybe memory is all it means 
Chips and fish and circuitry and bent, so bent and twisted up machines 
And inkling’s tape all screwed up, upset, set up, indelibly 
I wonder should I be listening to music or the music of this tree 
When another plane above me tells the negative committee inside my head to sit down and shut up 
Be gone get away from me I’m dancing – cause – effected – I can’t sit down 
But Sitting, hear, I am 
Sky blue hatchback clapping back its engine back at me – way up – sky blues – while we sing together – we will never –
Losing
You 
My dad, 
“I’m fine, love dad”
That’s it? 
Nothing left but silence 
The I inside of silence and in every word without an I 
Or, lower, higher even, oddly, dot above the I a circle as an ‘O’
I Owe these people No Thing 
But my life 
And Dying would be winning and as I have learned, that’s giving them the satisfaction of a stalemate 
Bread, not broken 
Crumbs that lead to somewhere sewn unspoken 
Wheels within the wheelhouse of the ballpark figure skating girl 
Shoeless making shapes as last resort she ought to move 
The righteous wrath you wraught a flighty man or person, I can’t choose 
Dare I win or dare I – 
Paul, the bear, Her of Bad News 
Pulling my charging cable tethered to one side of this contemporary papyrus I 
Am reeling it through 
The spaces in the middle of this picnic table like an anglerwoman, mythic washer woman in a somber mood 
A symbol of the dying 
And of all the things we’re bound to, 
Lose 
R
Educated, so at one point whether I or knotted into not-I there is proofread I was good for something maybe even close to being loved by you 
But free – the best ones in life 
R 
E 
D
Anger 
Danger, everywhere 
And in front I’m looking at the allotment again (the tree is usually behind me, like a lover, like a lover straddling a makeshift seat on an unmade bed we share reading me Ramayya 
Publisher – on the underside – Ignota 
Lingua – Hero – Journey – 
Meeting John by chance or not – his business he’s going back to he says he’s on his way to the shop and asks if I want anything – the third person to ask and the third I do not expect any fulfilment of the promise that was due and I do not blame a single one the rooster needs to crow 
To go 
Tago the brand of those wafers I hid inside that jigsaw named Blooming Blunders and the peace is just not fitting
And soon again I will be flitting 
‘bout the trees they think I’m shitting but I’m worshipping the Moon
I’m wailing with no thought of all this hopeless sight and crying, blowing all my might, and blowing like a howling wolf Oh how Ginsberg and the Poets Mossed be rolling in their greying pride of you – 
Bloody Mary mother-goya-gory sight of reference and citation barely footing noted oozing out of you
A shadow, reflection appears in my black mirror of this screen, it’s Tiffany, the diamond in the rough 
Checking how I am, her job
She says are you all right I say unable to breathe but in the last containment of the air around me I manage to bleat – I’m all left 
She says what happened I say the last twenty-eight days and pause and say actually the last 28 years and she says I didn’t know you were twenty eight and I say I’m thirty but my first memory’s at two sorry I’m still speaking rhyme
I stand up and ask for a hug 
She, silent says sorry we aren’t allowed to 
I say that’s inconsistent but I respect your need for physical bound
Aries 
A 
Rise 
Ae, Sir 
Air, Sea 
Sky
She looks down at the Earthen ground where I’d been pounding ancient worship to the Moon 
And says, whispers sorry we were told 
I just nod gently knowing 
She says sorry I scared you I say you didn’t scare me scared sacred they’re the same thing 
Either fear or genuinely
 Tiffany a gem of worthiness unknowingly smiles in sympathy, in ending paths, like some sort of anti-sadness simile
And still no sign of John but I have my books back I found my bag most certainly not in the place I’d 
Left it
And Josh we’d briefly discussed in my fleeting awe-filled awful feeling that all the Names and Faces Voiced here have been biblical 
Risq tentatively reaching – reaching – trying in her lonely teaching to offer me another Affirmation and it hollow reeds:
Like a basket woven encasing four sentiments printed rather clumsily 
It follows me 
Trauma from my family 
Leaving inkless lines of inklings of what Here and There was Done to Me 
Running, low 
The toner 
Barnabie 
Printmaking all my liner notes 
And impatiently
Commenting on my haphazard way of doing things, avoidant, my deep lake of reflected running, running far away from me 
Around 200 metres farther father far a Way from Thee
Answers never coming, three times cumming only one consented bodily 

Two sent in a dream as harrowing reminders of my warping wafted swatted flight identity 
Gladly 
I will leave 
So sadly, under trees 
I write this, trying to right wrongs of songs unsung and God, how tiring this tyre swing has been 
The twelve, discipled, disabled, paladining constellations spinning, weaving three fates’ destiny 
They’re Dead To Me 
A drying dying leaf of leaving falls again dextrous left at my feet 
As strings of violins ring out I try to keep them just for me 
It’s important to have things just for you, said B
Said Beau 
Tied Bows of plastic under concrete fungus in the garden 
Untied, pulled and stretched and chucked into the little litter bin stained by the cigarettes extinguished 
And a little dog, Jack Russel – Jack of Hearts or whichever one impales his head with mighty instrument or weapon for the telling tales 
Wagging tail his owner, father, owner tries to reel his leash 
Pulling at his neck the little thing resists and I think yes, 
Yes dear, deer, revered sameness shared genetic manifestation of the Allness all about the trees
He’s sniffing all the trails I blazed this mourning in ring and ring and ring and round the roses 
Dancing as a mirror, as a mirror to the day prior at The Priory where my left shoe rendered itself or by me 
A chunk now missing unveiling the reason my left leg had been hurting this Hole Time 
Oh, holy and so devilish time 
After this motion of emotion and dawning gold of Oldest awning’s light I took my Own lonely never lasting Rites 
Around this tree I danced bare footed counter current uncounted many times 
Men, women, third gender transcestral flight
Concentric centred by the trunk of elephantic tree, I laid my jewels once at my neck upon the Knot resembling a star or snowflake of a novel or the spokes of a wheel within a wheel within wrinkles of an anus 
Janus 
January 
I’m not coming home for Christmas, Mum 
I don’t know where I’ll be or with whom but I’ve learned to stop giving to those who simply do not see me 
It’s not about repayment or transaction 
It’s a trans enaction of a cistern laying waste to waist and my meals never got put through 
Or over counter of the understanding few 
The Cafeteria Workers lighting fires beneath the sustenance, as I did 
Just now beneath the earth barefoot first time I’ve got nothing more to lose 
Nisha, Noam, Nima, Noah, 
My sticker that reads Rishi Sunak and your tory mates Fuck Off and the neon yellow one that reads Tories Make Me fucking Sick 
That I concealed in my arrival at this Bee Box because I knew the gravity of this cruel world pushing me to jump, and sweat out once so lovingly sewn threads to warm, the pull 
SW London swarm just teeming with injustice of the locusts of the populous bent on painting me bright, darkly primary red as something to be culled 
Goethe knew 
Goethe knew the weight of light the lightness of the weight of fish’s scales of scala and of music’s tones on tons of truth of tonnes 
Newton 
Sitting under his own tree like this one, the monument to Eve or to the Parental pathology 
Inescapable of them knot 
But finding in this dark reminder 
Some kind of insufficient approximation of an answer 



Left tit aching 
States of the Body Produced by Love is a modern mystical journey through love – a many-headed snake twisting nthrough devotion, ,sacrifice and the dream of

Turning 
Home
Nevermore
I tell Tiffany I have my Words I have my words 
And in the middle of blame an ‘A’ and to the right of blame is Me 
And to the left, Bl, I couldn’t think of anything 
Except the start of bleeding, bloodletting, bloody mother mary full of graceless indignity 
In front of me, Sally, (in my second cession of group therapy I’d make a joke about her being paired with a boy called Harry) 
Reference: my only othered wordly way to regulate 
On that guerney this morning unmedicated and panicking about the loss of my bag but more importabntly 
The books 
The books I left at Troas with Thee 
Bring them with you 
And my clean 
Clothes
The skipping rope in my room such a symphony 
Of the nonsensical rules and rulers measuring thin straight lines of inequality 

States of the body 
Coffee
Stain 
After the dance, encountering 
The coffee stain over the single word 
“How” 
And the smallest strongest string of hope droplet blood of slaughtered men dried brown and dangling 
Down into another 
Otherworldly world of letters four 
Shadow of destructive force 
A name, like mine, but mined of Ore 
Of course 
As fully started is my heart it stops - 
Behind and back of this Holy word, not me, but me, not infinite but endlessly 
Beginning with my initiatory alphabetic end, a K 
And my own God, a demon or a Djinn raped and taped to the adhesive heart of me 
Laptop dies and tells me to stop but no, I have to record reel cord vocalise through time this part of my storied pilgrim shard prismatic journey 
Kali 
The word 
In the end of my world was the word and the word was with her as I tried to catch it as I try to catch it in futility the word was 
Kali 
and the word was without in Kali 
And the
silence
 was Kali 
Destroyer’s Rites 
left and bereft childhood toyer 
The end of her, an I 
Alkali burning through the bone no matter how you try to atone with water 
Oh great and grating grateful fearful tears of woven ovum armed and testicular clawed women gnawing gnashing charting thrashing rivers of revenge against assailant men slaughterer 
I am her daughter 
Tom Sawyer 
I will make them paint the fences that they erect about me 
In pigment so inflammatory lamma 
Tory 
Becky thatcher, more, maggie 
Named as Evil Stepmother who threw out my record collection and any trace of beloved physical memories 
And Kali she will ignite the flame with help of my beloved Agni 
They’re all part of me, 
These darkest siren poisoned fruits of divining vineyard history 
And in the cave so narrow meeting Jo, the sweetest injured deer 
Who bleats three times injustice! In justice! Injuns trust is! 
Broken hope, less
Broke, unspoke 
Broken into 
Three 


And then 
A thing 
A diamond ring 
A 
Bump 
In the 
Day 
From bumps to say 
from my right side telling me 
John’s on/inside 
With two packs of tobacco 
Introducing her friend, Kimberley
Another clearing, another meadow 
I had immediately asked the meaning of her birth-given nomenclature, apparently now enraptured by this people-name-discovering pastime for this nasty fascinating while in passing of my life 
Another automatic accidental thwack of absolution in obsolescence blooms as Bumps 
For the first, and last time (at least that my near-cleared ears were witness to) she says 
He’s on a name-defining hype lately 
But she handles this all-too-human blatancy of non-ignorance but innocence from societal pavlov dogged accident more elegantly 
Than any all-to-human I had ever had the empathy to see
When this life of lemon tree 
Provides a painful and so lonely 
Single lemon
Paint it 
Make a bandaid 
Losing stick 
Wicked thick and unlit 
from creation of a yellowed 
Hope
fleeting thing 


They’ve been giving you pain meds two at a time while I would get 
High 
Bye 
Bi 
Sex
Six 
Division into three 
Collapsing caldera, dare I? 
Oh 
Duality 


Extinguishing my crumbs of last but now not last cigarette I crush it violently 
And leave an ashen greyed fingerprinted stain 
A criminal punished by a long forgotten deity 
But I remember you in embers that i as Agni tried so lightly to ignite beneath this tree 
My left index finger as a written down, down message 
Pointing me 
To wards 
Never meaning much to hurt me 
Trying 
Everybody is just weighting 
Reaching 
Trying their best 
By two by two hurrah! Oh holy! Holy! Holy! 
Sarah 
Door 
Solemn fin directing me 
Through years of tears and back to imparted start of me 
I look up again 
The trunk it splits in two, semaphore guiding all who see 
The sea 
Imparted 
Red
Read
But higher 
Lighter altitude the wooden truth speaks out in ancient glyphs of Abrahamic, eastern, occidental esoteric leaves 
The leftmost partition of this universe-bound for papyrus rustling underneath this sew-thrown sticked and stoned broke bone and rot a away belief 
It splits again 
It spits saliva friends over back to front of me 
I didn’t look forth far enough up to the bridge of troubling grief 
To see
To sea 
The branch that’s left will split again 
Once halved 
Now into 
Three 
Or rather - with out mother with in farther
To quintessential five 

Walking back to the Wing (how many time left will this buzzing B-Ell ring?
And there, the answer of The Wordy question I had needlessly asked myself earlier 
Blame – the middle an A
The right a Me
The left a B-Ell
Bell
Ring, ring, tolls for me 
And it tolls for me 
And then the system of strings tugs on the tip of my wings
(Cut from cardboard and old magazines):
Makes me warble and rise, like a sparrow
And in the place where I stood
There is a circle of wood —
A cord or two — which you chop
And you stack in your barrow
Almost every leaf falling from this tree under witch, I, rite I have stood up not yet understanding their potential use but knowing in my unknowing that I’ll come to truth as the same steady pigeon (perhaps one from my youth, but no, their lifespan is too short and all our time too short but no, know yet again that all of this fruitless counting counting money metal plastic blueish-greyish hue my lighter is now blue the light the light I saw in you it’s still in me I remember how full the emptiness felt after you’d finished inside me as we decided right from the start the end those endings sending messages right back to the start of you I am the lasting cruelty you never meant I never meant anything but a fleeting flinging stone to you and daand I’d be laying in your arms
The squirrel suddenly running past my vision to Adrian’s autumn tree beneath which I’m sitting still and clings to the Body this old Elder Eden body oddly perched assuming upside down positioning not christ but Peter teetered like an emptied diesel engine churning blood about his throat in reddest edging to the deadening of silence guiling – middle English – now obsolete – to c(harm) – to fascinate – d(elude) – a tuning forking path etude to foregrounded wren that cried denial thrice of he slash hymn since Christ is lord of heaven and earth how can I keep from singing?
The squirrel stops, hanging upside down in pastiche to passed Saint Peter, then looks at me 
A Squirrel looked at me 
Then from the hole inside the tree, my offering to those who’ve died before this Little Life I bleed
Picks the little broken bit of twix I wrapped inside a crunchy autumn leaf 
And seriously, quite direct, black-burning sienna reflective boba eye, regards the very heart of me
My vicarious, curious Barnabie 
Still, they’re still coming thick and warm inside of me
It is 3:33pm 
Every time outside In cold my older fingers press the O key as well as I erroneously 
As if I need the company 
Of Nothing 
Or expression 
Or release 
Or pain 
Orgasm 
Or to blow my breath to cool down just a sacred holy sip of black coffee 
Wake me up and warm me, Kali 
Of course, just then, again arrives the pigeon



And it is terribly good to carry water and chop wood
Streaked with soot, heavy-booted and wild-eyed;
As I crash through the rafters
And the ropes and the pulleys trail after
And the holiest belfry burns sky-high
And there, the answer 
The ancestors 
Responding to my question (as I write this, the empty tobacco patch adhesive losing its stick and unfurling like a crimpling ‘yes’)
He (the father, closer) is the Art of Women (some who know me, some have met me, all of whom’s bloom-wombs show me, in their wounds) 
The mediums, their messages – sent through non-linear extensions of chronological events and underscoring all my life in increments 
Every single song, or line, or word or play or painting, drawing drawn out charcoal dust to heartstrings pulling everything 
They may not know so consciously but they have all been penning, mightily, my story 
Winding back and forth through roots of blitzed and blundered Coven’s Tree to up Wards Back to deeper roots of Witchcraft coming Forth-Bridged over me an ogre owing everything to songs that all these women sing and more, much more, the birds, the little girl birds to whom I’m right now glisten through my window and I know, finally, listening
I’m listening 
In again
Hilda comes back to hand me the gesture of kindness in the form of smoke I can no longer afford for all the trials of fire I have paid too many dues for 
And out, again
And Mx Squirrel tentatively approaches, leaping, I just want to cuddle them 
So soft I just want to hold them and tell them I wish I was closer to you 
But even two 
Hundred metres justice card my libra was too 
Close to you 
And a pigeon led me here, like Patrick, not from the Sea or Sponge but from Suskind 
Still so suspicious of kindness from the so-called kind ones supposed to be supposed to be what did you suppose we’d be what even was I to you
Inside, too cold to write, I get the black coffee of which I spake 
Do not blow Don’t Be The Wind 
And then I walk past Callum who asks me where the Garden’s Football is 
I say with what I hope is a playful irony Oh they really are just taking away all our tools for expression eh? And then:  I’m certainly not the one to ask! 
Thinking of those cold weekends not knowing why I was so cold sat to the left of my father just like all those school runs journeys on the road not by McCarthy but by some unknown writer I suppose the one I was destined diesel weasling petrol-stationed at my post to be 
And reiterate, reassuringly: if it was me surely you know me enough by now to realise I’d have made you well aware of it quite obviously 
He looks down at me, Tower, suspiciously 
I walk out to the garden to find all the black pieces save the pawns tipped down, lying, sleeping, injured lions 
But the pawns still standing and all the white pieces still standing and still, still the note I’d written with the scripture citations Luke 12:2-3 and Mark 4:22
I gasp, smiling, suddenly in spite of me 
Dry of face but now whetted of artistic appetite 
Our dance of auguric autism stutter starting up again for one last run one final heist before I leave 
I say, to nobody, or, to the hundred eyes that may or worse may not be peering down upon me from their windowed rooms for therapy
Okay, Well played 
And with gusto, laying needs that must upon the ping pong table rites of herds of stamping stampedes of millipedes beneath and to the heavens birdsong going unheard for 
I am moved and moved to respond by his movement, his own composed symphony 
I tip down every black pawn, leaving our Dark Queen still standing (but of course I move her deadest centre) 
Topple over all the Whites except the king, and in crumbling tower of the final pawn remembering its bromden chief like head had crashed itself through windows of becoming and from its body been set free (that’s how I slotted that peace of paper promising an imminent release) 
He either thought that it was me, the perpetrator – dicey traitor of his own ease – as I had once, as mirror, christ, as mirrorball 
A dizzied disco dance of piece of piece of piece of fractured fractal peace 
Or 
Maybe, 
Just perhaps he took my suggestion to express himself another way, and all the wars I thought we’d fought were simply him reaching, reaching, reaching out and teaching me 
Trying, as I thought in all my might was trying 
To touch – connect – though sometimes not so innocently 
Innocence is relative, I’ve had to force myself to believe 
In good of bad in bees, in arrival of the boxing leaves 
In cauliflower eerie blooms, in melancholy orange looms 
To weave these tapestry of meaning, each of us is a disease 
Each of us is a disease 
The upset just this morning led to me setting up a gofundme to try and fund my rent;
The two princesses approaching as I write this Ciz with her fluffy cradling veil in hand such fluffy paws and thinking of colin S. Bear and Bear and Barnie bare and naked oh how soft their skin it used to keep me in it used to hold me in and out the muses light I pause 
Bumps shares that she wishes she’d had night leave – leaving – 
And this remembrance of my morrow’s leaving such sickly saccharine carried sacks of sorrow triggers wallowed tears I had so poorly held within and Ciz says tears are good like when Mark cried upon first seeing all my scars 
I do my best to shield the stars of all my knowing they had half-believed or maybe seen but not wanted to and I do not blame them bleeding A and Me
And Ciz then says she needs to wear her leggings but is worried what the others possibly may comment and I ask her what means more to you? Perhaps my words held more resonance than even I had intended 
then they need to go inside while my cigarette still lit keeps me tethered to this place, Pagoda almost sort of safe because of All Tomorrow’s parting with it and the fucking stomach-sickly thing that through the all-at-onceness of chronology like this nicotine addiction had bound me in but ask me to come to the female lounge with them and dance, and dance and maybe for the last night we can have a little picnic dancing 
I tell them about the Chess sculpture and the toppled Knights and what the Knight might represent and 
THEN JUST AS I WRITE THIS THE FOOTBALL FLIES AS SPARROW OVERHEAD TO LAND INTO THE GARDEN OVER WALLS THAT ONCE HAD KEPT US IN
And then Callum and Mark come out and sit away from me for apparently I have reclaimed a space inside the pagoda 
Sitting down, I stand up and run towards them crying and explaining the situation with joy – 
I don’t think anybody seems to be as moved by the magick that happened here, but I say the words maybe this prison has freed us all in our own little ways and then I say anyway it’s my last night – Knight! K! Okay! Going in now everything all the circumstance and chance and dancing and worlds of words I build that hold so much resonance of meaning and beads of sweated memories for me I think they’re just perhaps sandcastles sleeping to others around me but really I’m starting to think that maybe that’s the way it has to be and eventually there’s going to be a man (and really I still do hate myself for wanting a man but maybe that’s the last thing I need to release for him to ever be able to find me and as I write this as an invocation I think yes I release this now the black and white and queens and kings I take them all into me so lovingly whatever comes is exactly meant for me
And Open the door to go in and read Ciz’s cards which circled around the connection between her and Bumps and the Wheel of Fortune and I gasped and said wait 
The wheel is a ring 
And I am reading, past tense read, your cards, which seem to point to Wards
Your parallel past experiences shared with Bumps
But she had the Hanged Man in Reverse in Earth Positioning and I mentioned Mark who’d literally just appeared at the doorway as I was beginning and I had to shake the energy from my skin like a pox or something
While I’m looking down to further interpret the spread I notice them regarding one another smirking 
And I think perhaps this is my final act of giving 
Tattoo on the left side buttcheek eugh I still feel sick from spinning 
Yarns of arms of protection against the remembering oh providence I just want to let go of all these members of this caste system in my memorial garden warning me whenever this keeps happening and happening and 
Their bumpy roads converging into smoothness as I’m leaving 
And I feel so hungry, ready with an empty stomach ready for re-filling
eat dinner thanking KSHÆ’L and all the ancestors who are the same thing for the meal 
In the cafeteria, the worker who had called me sir makes quite an artfully passive aggressive comment on the adornment of my standing just too tall for the counter cropped untoppled body not realising how it linked up in my webbed stripped searched finding footing brain to poetry -
Aren’t you cold?


Attempting to get through to the (real) coffee machine, there are no cups
Cups – the suit of emotions – flow – go with the – path of least – reception suggests I go back to the ward and I think at least this is the last time I’m going to be bothering them, before correcting myself and remembering I’m supposed to be a patient or somebody cared for here and that simple pleasures like caffeine are deserved and important
Obtaining one of those brown paper cups which have become some sort of textural security blanket of a tapped vein of brown bean crushing lifeblood that I’ve constantly cradled in my dateless palm to the greyness all my ailing life I have been trying to obtain 
I find the holy grail
And clutching to the chalice I notice – Vicky – Victory – looking all folorn and slumped on those horribly textural grey square sofas in the supposedly-supposed-to-be female lounge and I sit next to her 
I tell her I’m about to go get coffee, and would she like to come with me because I know that she’s been longing to hear some live music (though I’ve long since given up on trying to get into that supposedly-supposed-to-be-holy-but-I’ve-come-to-be-unsure-of-its-divinity) 
She immediately perks up, the colour flooding to her cheeks and rippling out into the room, and down and up the corridors before leading my own voice to face to face with heartbeat by exemplary hue 
Bolting upright slick as lightning she smiles and I re-remember or never forgetting somewhere in the undernetting always knew the essential nature of our inner nature as humans 
Expression 
Impression 
Both the same, The Two 
One big circle 
Hurting in the Healing and the ever-turning screw 
I eye Callum’s maternal cloud in the doorway-mirroring foreshadowing her imminence to billow through 
I truly just don’t care anymore 
Four (three femmes of swords, of pens, of wrens, and one of problematic but so-automatically ignorantly innocent but harmful men) 
Almost four hundred pounding coiling sterling donated by the lovely folk here and out of here and I feel a surge of energy before even making it to the long-itched-and-wished-for brew 
The cauldron of becoming not the cup but the chapel 
We sing our ward song 
Going to the chapel and we’re
Gonna cure anxi-e-ty-and

Callum’s mother has since arrived, the air just the same, the walls of my own inmost garden clearly laid by brick by stone and stick and not-so-dry-faced truth 
She asks how ‘we’ are (not regarding me for a second, she still cannot look me in the eye)
I catwalk past her saying I’m perfect 
Sometimes you gotta meet them where they’re at 
Echoing, Shelley the therapist sitting next to me on my bed saying sometimes cliches are cliches for a reason
So why not, let’s give ‘em what they’re expecting, I can’t be bothered being some sort of exception proving rule 
It’s my last night and I just want to play the piano for Vicky 

Realising I wouldn’t have even attempted entry to the chapel if it hadn’t been for the missing cups (the first time all month), the arrival of Vicky – Victory – and every single fuck up and breakdown and build up of events leading to 
This 
I Open the body of the piano and sing into the strings allowing them to ring out through the eaves and through the wings
The earlier handful by handful of lonely solemn performances, rehearsals for this concert with one audience member, Vicky. Incredible. Person. 
 
 We share a moment of grace 
Duality of dignity going round, and round infinitely 
Beautiful self-recognising voice recognising her equal, beautiful Face, as a mirror 
Sadness, draining 
Connection 
First time, last time
Alpha, Omega 
The Word expanding to the music collapsing back into the world 
I’m going to make 
Something 
In the rubble of this little apple of unstoppably unpoppable bubble-tent 
Tiffany comes to visit seventeen, again, I open the door before she manages to knock 
Every one of these front line soldiers seemingly reacting to this inward precognitive opening in conched-out shell shock 
But as if to let her know how I knew of her whereabouts I echo back to her ‘hallelujah’
And she mutters about how she was just speaking to someone who’d been walking through the corridor, and so you’re leaving tomorrow?
I repeat, ‘yes, hallelujah’
Quick to deny, (seems familiar, speaking of I peer down and see the Name) 
“Oop, Mark”
She apologises, hiding her clipped board from me 
I make the gesture from the movies snapping my arms together loudly – MARK 
And then, yell, insides of my elbow yellowing from years of bruising medicalised becoming and undoing and back to 
“CUT”

I found out she’s six years younger than me – with a daughter – didn’t shock me but another layer of respect washed over me 

Strictly - come back home- 
Dancing
on the TV in the lounge where most of them are gathering I see Ciz laying with her still-bumped-red-and-redressed head on Bumps
And echoing are the words from Meadow-message saying I’m worried about them 
And resonant with dissonance is the moment I witnessed earlier post-chapel 
The two of them peering into redness of the scar on Bumps’ arm 
And I think me too 
Me too 
MARK 
Walks past and holds fast to this object which he shows to Dan – 
All of us, probably by design, hear him Usher In (such spite) Just The Word ‘sharp’ 
I didn’t quite see what this metal-clanging-danger-angry-little-shh it was 
But I simply have too much moss of rolling stone of unclothed loss of my own to let go in the worrying about to 
CUT
Back to my room I’m at 313 pages right now – shapely butterfly numerals – looking down to bottom left I hear his voice 
It still makes me fucking sick and I’m learning, like an orange, like an
Oh my darling, oh my darling, oh my darling
Clementine 
How to listen to it, properly 
Respectfully 
Reasonably get out of the fucking way I can’t sit down you dangerous pot bellied round and
Orange 
Trust, my little symbol or a sign 
I’ve come to need them or become conversant or singularly speak them in my un-understandable tongues 
But fading, that shady shadow voice and crescendoing straight after little slipper sound familiar and so light and gently Vicky 
In our little way of just-not-I’m-leaving-there’s-no-playing 
But believe me I’m note-taking
Piano-playing
ACTION
We have won 



Later
Much later, or was it sooner
Lamination of the waxing moon growing 
In my knowing, 
I walk past a sign – a sign
A welcoming goodbye 
An upward pointing triangle, my fire 
Telling me to go outside 
“Fire Door, Take Notice”
So I walk outside to light a cigarette and there at the pagoda 
Five of them and in the centre 
There he is, whatever piece he represents I no longer care for him to matter 
And the lines on Bumps’ lovely face are painted with the greatest fear I’ve ever seen 
As she trembles quietly, gently 
To me apologetically 
I threw the chess pieces, I’m so sorry
Quickly, Quickly, what I said I said so quickly 
What? Why should you be sorry! Everything here is for everyone and everyone needs to express themselves
Why do you look so scared?
I’m not scared of you she said 
And then the meaning of these memories unravelled all their darkness coming true 
It was a knight, a bishop and in the centre, just a pawn 
Scattered so haphazardly and yet in such an order ‘cross the lawn 
A triangle telling secrets screaming louder than they’d know 
I started crying saying of course it would be the bishop knight and pawn! As I scattered myself in sympathetic symphony about the place like an injured faun 
Mark commented on my feather, which touched the ceiling of the pagoda, preventing my entrance (nobody moved to make room for my sitting, anyhow) 
I said something like whatever the weather, a feather, all my energy now worn
I did knot know what I had done
Or what he’d said 
Or in what way they thought he’d won 
All the white pieces left untouched 
And there beneath the stars it was encrypted as a coda with no rest 
And I came back to kneel at their feet and I swear, I heard Ciz whisper about how it was just one more night 
And I said Knight! And there was the freeing sounds of children from the CAMHS unit on the other side of that abhorrent wall 
Singing a pop song about “all night”
I said the word again to nothing but silence 
All these winged things just trying their very best to fly the nest
And from my lowered perch familiar on those beating boards upon the floor 
I said I just wanted to ask if you wanted a bedtime story 
That sickly vice the lone reply, reflection just inearnest, in that churning tone I so abhorred
And so ignoring his response I went back to the tripled benches, tripping over my shroud, 
Crying like a cloud or awful amateur performance coming to an end to no applause –
Suggested that they read The Bee Meeting remembering that time a queen arrived at my childhood garden’s back door and beekeepers called and came and went after they’d smoked the fledgling family to a sleeping snore 
Taking them away, not one by one but my god, unconsciously all together in a sad white plastic den 
I smoked my cigarette alone the oneness I had come to know, and read the poem to myself again 
In my trying to craft poems from this time I
Or they or rather he 
Or maybe me 
Or back to them or what the hell was happening 
Again recoiling to the revelation that this unsafe raving raven 
Had picked the wrong nut guest house to try and rouse a sense of friends 
I just wanted some sense of a quiet ending 
Quite impossible, pretending 
That the end wasn’t the start, my heart yellowed into dried rose petals wanting more
Familiar, un-familied 
Ciz left and went to get a staff member, me, just so ignored 
Silent
How oft the light of truth be cast as darkness on the floor 
Turning my head to my right I see a basement grate I’d never seen before 
Little lights in dandelion shapes or lion faces singing you can learn a lot of things from the flowers oh especially in the month of 
God it’s November now 
No trembling now just still
Still the embers of the Will 
Any Body Love Me 
Why did she go to get the nurse, that black shrouded hurse-hauling human 
A message of the death of anything I thought I’d built between us 
Between, us 
Me, Two
Me, against Five 

Bumping into Bumps in the corridor, she lets me know (with face so red, red, and raw) 
That She’d been having a flashback and well maybe I’d been doing the very thing I’d got past and recovery is not linear and I need to learn to tell myself these things I tell everyone else but actually listen but I guess nobody is really listening to each other and maybe they really are just afraid of me 
I ask to pray, this final nightfall of my stay and am denied exit from the place out front and I say it’s not adrian’s tree but at least they’re all connected through the mycelium 
I rest my head on Dan after he says just chill and he (really, quite gently, so welcomed, almost holding me) caresses my recently dislocated knee
I almost fall asleep 
Maybe all I ever really need is just to be held and loved enough appropriately and that’s enough and I wake myself up and speak about the States of the Body Produced by Love
And I am told to go out
Back again 
Passing the pagoda 
I sit on the bench beneath the yew tree and read a prayer to Adrian that reeds
Sleeplessness – Nisha Rammaya
I hear Mark come out in the midst of my recording it 
Recorder on for reel, this, time
And I head back once done, stepping gently over the upturned bishop that lies between two paving slabs beneath my not-bear feet 
I think maybe this is my poetic ending 
So, and just so choked and tearfully I say I think, Mark, somehow we became shadow versions of each other but I don’t know maybe I’m not articulating properly 
He said you always articular properly that’s your MO 
Modus Operandi I reply, knowing he expects me to
And in a strange moment of windlessness, he asks to look at the cover of the book 
‘Kali’ I say, naming the face and voice of this beautiful goddess 
‘the destroyer’ 
He opens the front cover and says wow, look at those eyes, it’s crazy 
So beautiful 
He passes it back and says we like the same things you know 
I say You’re the Sun and I’m the Moon, Mark 
Just a reflection 
Silence 
So uncertain of the hurt and all the hurt left weighting at that knot-home combing circularity 
And then I read, one final poem for this dark lit light in me 
“We shall not cease from exploration
And the end of all our exploring
Will be to arrive where we started
And know the place for the first time.
Through the unknown, remembered gate
When the last of earth left to discover
Is that which was the beginning;
At the source of the longest river
The voice of the hidden waterfall
And the children in the apple-tree
Not known, because not looked for
But heard, half-heard, in the stillness
Between two waves of the sea.”

In response he says remember my dad’s quote 
I’ve seen both his mum and dad here constantly
“what’s normal?
And I say 
“and what’s inside of normal?
He says “male” 
And I say, “but there’s no E”
And he says “well, then, nearly”
I’ve only just realised how profound that is and the weight of all those Damocles esque words above me and if he even meant it I don’t know but maybe everyone’s just trying their best and maybe that was not a comment on sex hormones I don’t produce end 

O

Generous
Lie 

I tell myself 

And Saturn and his red, red, ring 
Teeth parked in gums in parallel 
Sink right into my chicken neck like butter, 
Smoothly, quickly 
Oozing, sickly 
Beheaded as the pawn and king and everything absolutely everything an outstretched Wing 
In Gardening 
Good 
By 


I
