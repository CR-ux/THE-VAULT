DAY FIFTEEN

The Dream was of this place as a Boarding School 
And a shared bath, not quite big enough for five of us 
As Children, innocent 
Platonic Non-sexuality 
Safety in Our Own Bodies. 
Safety in the Difference of Our Own Bodies Never Felt By Any of Us. 
I was told to go home 
I’d forgotten my laptop 
I was working as a stripper 
In a queer club 
Or maybe I was a punter 
Or maybe I was both 
It must have been 
There was a pole to get to the upper level
Mezzanine 
And a disabled man was trying to carry his drink and pull the flagpole-pulley system that inexplicably allowed the ascent of the rider 
I remember thinking, or Unthinking, in this thoughtless timeless space 
Floor sticky with sugar from cheap mixers and even-cheaper vodka 
The upstairs, an exclusive space for trans people 
There was a film playing 

It was time to get on the bus 
(The whole thing was very infantile) 
I realized, thanks to Lynne, that I had forgotten my laptop 
My lifeline 
Left 
Behind 
It was time to go 
Time to take flight from this pit of mulch and Earth 
And like a prisoner in Stockholm I found myself mourning 
Then, Morning 
As my phone groans itself into power 
In an instant, a flash 
Lightning
A call from my mother 
I tell her, 
About my justifiable sadness 
And anger 
At the unending cycles of neglect 
I feel no guilt, no shame 
As I say those three words, echoing from the beginning of My Book to the last syllable of recorded time:
Where were you?
As I tell her how I was harassed
Harrass – Middle French – harer –  to set a dog on 
This body is not your own
To such
Deaf
Deafening
Deaf ears 
She continues to talk about the holiday she has booked 
Well, good, I say, you need to see the sea 
I wax and wane poetic about the forking paths of least resistance 
Water trickling through the wrinkle-rivers of my dried, flaking cheeks 
I do not police my tone, my voice’s timbre 
Resounding as the last judgement’s Trumpet 
I tell her about my book 
And hear the whistle of a bird blowing, in a tree outside the pinhole-slit in Room 17’s window. 
Again I wonder who else stole their own slice of fresh breath in this space 
My eyes rising to the top right corner, now deadened, once full of a fearful presence 
I don’t know if HE is even there anymore 
I think about the pain in my heart last night 
And Last Night 
The Silence of Last Night 
The Screaming Silence of the Bleating Women Gathered around as I read their cards
Four of Swords, for each of the Four Women 
Lord of Rest from Strife 
Rest, I tell them, you all need, 
And deserve, 
So much Rest – never afforded to you
To Us
I’m not a child because I am 
My makeshift altar cloth, fashioned from flip chart paper 
Crinkling and wrinkling on the Obtrusive, Obstructive Oval table in the patient Lounge 
The General Patient Lounge 
No longer relegated to a dedicated space, 
We have moved with out flagella, no longer self-flagellating, but in motion 
Motion – 
The Chariot. The Hanged Man. No longer in reverse. Upright. Spine Straight. Standing Tall as I sit on the floor across from these beautiful souls, one by one drawing down their Highness
The High Priestesses, communing with a mystery not known but felt by the reaching, teaching each of us
Nietzche – Our God Never Died, Yours Is Turning In His Grave
And Thus Spake The Divine Feminine 
Flowing through us in the dark, Night Blooming Flowers 
The Great Ones Of The Night Of Time
And where were all the Men But One? 
The One who, thinking he was unwatched, 
Placed a microcosmic Arachne at the windowsill, whispering “I Will Protect You” 
His perceived lack of witness the ultimate sign of virtue 
The Sun That Asks Not To Be Seen 
Is an ally of the Moon 
The Moon who accepts no less than Fullness 
And Newness 
And all the stages in between 
Shimmering, reflecting, taking her rightful place as a Mirror 
Not in Submission, 
But in Defiant Surrender 
Those Unheard Melodies 
But, called by a Heard Melody 
A Herd of us, including the White Bishop 
Or White Knight 
(I haven’t quite decided his allocated symbol just yet) 


The Herd of us enter the Chapel singing a song about 
Going to the Chapel and we’re
Gonna Cure Anxi-e-ty
Empty 
Empty 
Every time I try to enter a group session
Empty 
As if they see me coming and clear like pigeons with the clunking joyful feet of a child 
I’m not a child because I am

I play, I play, I do not just play I POUR 
While commenting, gently 
Gently, gently
On the tinny ripples contained within the piano, and open the Body so the others can bear witness to what He has done
And suddenly, 
He is gone 
The White Bishop Or Knight Or Whatever He Thinks He Is 
Disappeared 
Who knows where 
And of course the four of us women have to go searching for him 
Mine and Claire’s naïve and fruitful duet cut short 
So they might pay him some attention
I however 
Dance 
I stand at the camera while the gate bell rings 
Waiting to be allowed to escape for my cigarette 
Striking pose after pose 
(The Nurse had lovingly said this morning that she enjoys my security camera dances so much, that she sometimes waits even longer to buzz for my release) 
This didn’t annoy me, it empowered me 
And so, 
I dance
The call, unanswered 
Definitely by design
“The Cheek!” I taunt, with just as much warmth and love as Ruth has shown me 
Your People Will Be My People 
Then, or This Mourning, Later or Earlier-
Two figures 
Unshrouded 
White-clad 
Are whispering, below the sounds of grinding gravel halts 
Sophia, wise as she is, says to the Man In Baritone 
Don’t be Rude
I look up from my writing and repeat her words, to his shocked, waxed, bearded face 
How did you hear? He asks 
I hear. I reply. 

i.
Here. 
Sophia asks me if I am coming to groups 
Understanding Depression, Understanding Anxiety 
I say sure, I’m doing this thing where I take the path of least resistance 
And follow them to the group, 
Held in the chapel 
Ten metres ahead of me, they enter the building, 
Extinguishing my cigarette I attempt to follow, ringing the bell 
Answered this time, but with the rustling sounds of the nurse’s office playing in harmonious overtones 
To the high, low, high, low buzzing of the security system 
It’s not letting me let you in I hear the nurse complain 
It’s a metaphor – I joke, half-joke, I don’t joke at all 
And then the gravelled path of least resistance calls to me, in realization 
These people are not leading me where I need to go 
This locked door is a message 
Every. Locked. Door. Is. A. Message. 
I walk back to the forking path of Gravel 
My size Elevens Gavels 
Upon the judgement of this place 
And come across, like the Pigeon from a lifetime ago, in the exact same spot 
A struggling little Bumbling Bee 
At first, seeming like a balled up piece of cotton – 
So gentle
Gently
Whatever you are about to do, do quickly 
So swiftly I tear an edge from the end of my automatic writing notebook 
Bottle Green Fake Leather bound in Elastic 
And lift up this little chalice of alchemy 
Slowly carrying her to the resting place of that Great Bird of Rebirthed Boundaries 
I sit on the bench with her for a while, perhaps believing too strongly that my breath may breathe into her, that the emerald reflected in her eyes is telling me the answer to the question of Her Suffering
I cross the Threshold, Holding Her 
Her antennae saluting me, as I saluted the magpie landing at our feet 
Mine, of two, hers, of three 
Missing half her appendages, I shed a tear or three and say 
Sweet Angel You Can Make It 
Her Smallness (relative to that grey Dove) offers her an advantage 
Her Hollowness, her respiratory system of a pipe organ, Air Direct To Organelles
Teaching me the Lessons again – 
Lessons that took me far beyond Biology 
Into the Truth of vulnerability 
I set up Four Swords of mulching leaves about the Resting Place
I laid her, resting, in the middle Earth 
With a single dewy yellow leaf 
Not wallpaper, no, 
Not Ceiling, no
A sky – 
I placed above her a sky that I prayed would rain, small drops of dew upon her 
Which I had sprinkled, on the underside, with White Sugar from a sachet, pocketed this morning while fetching Ciz’s cappuccino 
Forgetting how many evil calories she must have seen within the paper
So this act of kindness spread, went trans-species 
From the Arachnoid Thing to the Human Girl to The Insect Woman Lying in the Dirt 
I breathed upon her wings, her front appendages coming together in devotion to the life we both shared 
And walked back through the opening of the Branches. 
Dancing
It is time to return to the Chapel 
And play the piano, however 
Loudly 
I 
Wish


The AA meeting walks in as I play 
I smile, grateful for the collaboration 
Grateful for the different receptionist, who gave me the accurate timings of the chapel, letting me know
Gently, gently
The timings the room may be free, 
While Also alerting me to the fact that there may be Others coming and going 
This forewarning makes the chair-stacking, chip-laying, chitter-chatting intrusion feel less like an interruption and more like a symphony, 
Alien families of some recovery Orchestra 
Bent on helping others through isolation 
Through togetherness
So what sounds could be better laid atop this metallic, poor string-snapped piano 
Twelve minutes, 6 in solitude, 6 in unison with these wonderful strangers 
And at the end 
They thank me for the playing
I thank them for the accompaniment 
I point to the golden chalice they have brought with them 
Crucible 
The vessel of transformation 
The crack in the stained-glass window has disappeared, unnoticed 
And I don’t feel a breeze anymore 

In the Pagoda 
The girls are now 
Occupying 
The White King 
Relegated
(Good )
To the benches in the distance 
The White Pawn 
Who Thinks
 He’s a Bishop 
Comes out
Starts kicking a ball around 
So loudly 
Reminding us of the time he aimed directly 
At Ciz’s Head 
I think about Red 
I look left 
And see the space left by the absence 
The Cacophony of absence left by the Black queen
Who sits so afraid in my wardrobe 
And I think of the Three wonderful women around me 
In the Very Scene of The Crime 
And How 
I’m not fucking taking puynishment anymore 
For something
I 
Didn’t 
Do
I stand up 
Take the remaining ball 
(basket) 
(Read)
And I kick it as hard as I can in my Black Heels 
Into all the black pieces
Screaming:
OH ISN’T IT SO FUN TO EXPRESS YOURSELF WITH VIOLENCE AND SCARE ALL THESE TRAUMATISED WOMEN DON’T YOU FEEL SO BIG LITTLE BOY
Grabbing my stuff, I walk out with my head held at the 188cm Height it was made to be 
Maybe 6cm short of his, but so 
So much taller 
He stood there in a silence that, for once, didn’t scare me 
I’m not afraid of you
And then, in the chapel, at the piano that he tried to silence 
You Cannot Silence Me 
I pour, pour, 
I pore 
I seep and pore 
And cry and pore
I pour this Chalice into that same River of Lethe-Lacrimosa 
While pouring, for perhaps the first time, Another Chalice entirely of my own 
Onto the riverbank
And shaking, fingers shaking so terribly, the familiar shame tries to creep back, 
And I pick up my phone to see four sharp messages 
From these Swords of Women 
Saying they are proud of me 
No Shame 
No Sorry 
Only thanks 
For reminding the boundary between compassion and I’m Not Taking Any More Of This Shit You Can Only Show So Much Compassion And When Your Pain Encroaches On My Safety Then You Can Wave Goodbye To My Compassion This Is The Definition of Boundaries
I Do Not Care How Tall You Tower 
How Short You May Be With Me - 
No Longer 
Will I paint myself as the seed of destruction, as the Shadow of everyone 
I am the light of Resilience 
And when meeting such deep, deep, violent darkness 
That light
That Lightning 
 is often perceived as shadow 
The God In What This Sick, Sick World Views As Demonic 
Of Course! 
Of Course I would immediately revert to making it my own fault, thinking myself the source of all this chaos 
I’m just a fucking mirror 
And mirrors, like copulation 
Are Considered Abominable 
Because
They Increase 
The 
Number
Of 
Women 

So after gathering snacks for the girls 
 we gather back in the girls lounge to report this Mess On The Inside to Ruth 
One
Sixteen
Seventeen 
The Star 
Shine 
And then 
Burning 
Burn 
They call in the Man From The Pagoda 
To Back them up 
To be believed 
And so, 
I have to leave 
The Love is in the Leaves 
I come back to Room 17 
My South Star 
The Room At The End Of The Hall 
With No Kind Of View 
But a Floodlight 
Flooding the stream with this artifice 
Nima, we’ve gone outside together 
They say 
Desperate to grab this opportunity for safety 
I roll a cigarette and in sending the same number of messages as the number on my bedroom door 
I try to find them, 
And outside, in blackest blackest bile of the loneliness I receive no reply 
I cry 
And press the hospital call button 
Wiping my tears for the camera 
Not Ready For Any Kind of Close Up 
Further
Farther
Father 
Forgotten 
Gone, rotten 
No 
Body 
To Call My Home 
The call is answered in silence, door unlocked again 
I ask the HCA to escort me to my bedroom, and upon finding the other women in the female lounge I breathe a sigh of relief 
Saying I’m not feeling Now’s pain I must be feeling my past 
They say it wouldn’t be too hard to make Upper Court Male and Garden Wing Female 
I agree 
And then make a dumb self-deprecating joke about the amount of genders there are nowadays
I make a joke about JK Rowling 
About me  being ‘a man in a dress trying to get into women’s spaces’ 
They ask me, in such searing sincerity 
My opinion on JK Rowling 
I realise this inquiry is genuine 
I say she is misguided and wrongfully directing her trauma from men, her very justified anger that should be pointed towards men, towards other women 
And then 
Two of the swords pull themselves from the Stone 
Of my heart 
Leaving the room 
I sink 
I am not as One of Them as I’d allowed my Stinging Heart to Hope 
With all its never-quite-getting-there 
Arrows 
Pointing 
Somewhere 
Nowhere 
Here, this Nowhere 
This Eye 
This Right Eye of Mine 
And only Mine 
Again, the saline zephyr pours itself 
Upon the banks of my broken face
Made to be Miss 
Under 
Stood 
They ask if I’m okay and tearfully I say I’m going to write the next Harry Potter
I shuffle myself back to my room Alone 
I am not a child because I am
Unmothered 
Othered by These Mothers 
Eat Crisps for dinner 
Back to My Marginalia 
Margin – Latin – Margo 
– Edge. 
No- ending. 
No. 
I sink into my nightly bath 
Try to connect to the water 
Try to feel held by Something 
Anything
Try to relieve myself of this 
Wait
Almost inhaling water 
Adrenaline drained but pulse sustained 
I wake, choking from the moisture in my lungs 
Remembering my Reason. 
Latin – Ratio – Reckoning. 
Somehow I muster the strength 
Fortitude Upturned 
To leave the bath 
To dry This Body I decide to reclaim 
Reclaim as my own and only my own and yet – 
This 
Body 
This Body of Women 
I vowed to protect 
I vow and ever-vow and ever-promise always to protect 
No matter our difference no matter what difference is shrouded upon my slightly-too-wide-shoulders
I place my hand upon the black queen, now garlanded by the elasticated red strings intricately organized into a plaited bracelet too small for my wrist but which I knew witch I knew would eventually make its purpose known to me 
Red
Ring
Parallel＝
I place my hand upon the head of this majestic structure 
Smooth 
Dark 
Reflecting all the light cast down upon her 
I whisper the words 
“Protect all women, keep all women safe, world over, world over women may these words sustain and pedal themselves around and around and around like a crown of flowers above each of your sacred heads so mote it be”
I leave Room Seventeen
Latin – Septa - Hedge – Boundary 
Seven embodies both completion and division 
Seven is divine 
Septum – the boundaries of the body
This
Body
Division as completion 
Holding space for opposites 
Seven as a threshold 
Teen, Ten
Deca – Greek – Deka - 
Completion 
Return to Unity 
Symbol of Divine order 
Union of Heaven and Earth 
Cycle Ends, Cycle Begins 
Alpha, and Omega 
Pure Completion, yet Pure Potential 
Ten Fingers, Ten Toes, Ten Sephirot 
Sephirot 
Sephira
Koinē Greek - σφαῖρα -  "sphere".
Safar – Numerate, 
Number, Category, 
Sphere.
Light. 
Sapphire 
Safir – or Lapis Lazuli 
Celestial Blue 
This Yellowing Blue Wallpaper
The Throne of God 
Clarity, Purity, Divine Wisdom 
Insight, Awakening
The Quest For Truth. 
The Resonance of sound transcends definition
Phonetic closeness is no coincidence 
The Collective Psyche holds remnants of shared Mystical wisdom 
Logos – The Word Was With God and The Word IS God - Sound and Meaning converge 
A Glimpse into Divine Unity.
An Echo of Divine Light. 
Each Symbol, a key 
Each phonetic echo a resonant marker of connection 
And Disconnection –
Language is alive 
Verbal Alchemy 
Language is an entity we are all collaborating in creation 
And of course, 
Destruction 
Putting something into language is a spell 
Yet in the same breath, limit the infinite potential of a concept 
A revelation and containment 
A revelation, an invitation
Casting a net over the ineffable 
A convergence 
A bridge, a Burning Veil 
A force that illuminates one path, 
An Ode to Autumn 
A paradox 
Para – Greek – distinct from – beyond 
Doxa – Opinion – belief 
Something that Lies Beyond Belief 
A truth that is Ungraspable within our assumed frameworks – 
The spaces between the bars of a cage. 
Every
Single 
Word
Is a paradox 
In recursion.
