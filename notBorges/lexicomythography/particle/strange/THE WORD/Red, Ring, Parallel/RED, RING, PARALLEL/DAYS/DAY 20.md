DAY TWENTY 
The Moon


I don’t want to see poppy pins 
Sticking needles in my I 
Oh, please
Opium 
Peeling layers of what you think I am from the heart of all the art of me 
Trees felling, telling, freedom - this is not the place for me 
But neither’s anywhere, this plane 
unreeling unreal reality 
Spoil. A spool a spoof a tool 
I have been used so uselessly 
Inverted hurt, I send it, worse 
I send it out from under me 
A spell that works, a wretched thirst 
Ten plus one 
Eleven
Even 
One left 
Standing at the threshold 
Observing the divine 
A branch 
An olive branch 
Oh 
Live 

The etymology of “eleven” is quite interesting! It comes from the Old English word endleofan, which means “one left” (over ten). This is derived from the Proto-Germanic ainlif-, which literally translates to “one left.” It reflects the concept of being “one more than ten.”

In numerology and various spiritual traditions, eleven is often seen as a master number, symbolizing intuition, insight, and spiritual awareness. It carries a sense of standing at the threshold between the physical and spiritual worlds, much like your interpretation of the number as observing the divine. Eleven can be seen as a bridge, representing a point of connection and potential between worlds or states of being. This aligns beautifully with your reflections on finding balance and meaning in life.

But hear – 
The Heart 
Back to 
The Start of Me. 
Walking past the opus of this fakery 
The hustle, hustling bustle of the nursery 
Nurse’s Office, Fishbowl, Finding Nemeses in every corner
Turning, seasons 
I hear in stories, in passing, that Man, Mark, has been shouting violently –
The Veil is thinning – approaching ground of Halloween 

Outside I send a quote from the book I am reading to the Girls Group Chat:
Toss the bones into the water behind you 
And don’t look back 
As I realise I’ve left my headphones, once a shield, no, cage bars falling, leaving 
Leave - 
And then, 
Bobo! 
The Sweet Golden Retriever 
Waiting in the distance 
I call his name three times, with Joy 
Tentatively he watches me, until I remove my sunglasses 
Then, bounding clumsily – 
Here he comes, pure Light, pure joy – 
The gardener, his Mother 
Follows after saying “in your own time!”
Time, 
As a symptom
Of this incurable disease 
‘It remains that we palliate what we cannot cure 
Tongues, like governments-’
Like administrations
‘-have a tendency to degeneration’
Generation
The gardener (Capricorn, my rising sign – rise – rope – ladder – Jacob – cracker – bread -  breaking – making – friends – make -  mark – foe – foliage)
Asks if I’m in room Twelve 
Twelve
I say no, Seventeen 
She says she’s been told some plants have started growing into the room
We both calculate which room number it must be 
Finally finding the answer in Sixteen
One : Sixteen 
Where you go, I’ll go, where you stay, I’ll stay,
Your people
My people
Your God
Will – Fire – Pit of Stomach – Ashen Tree - 
My God 
My Goddess 
Appears Over Me 
Under, Grounding Everything 
And three 
Then Four 
Swords, Sticking 
Not a single Poppy in sight 
I remember, perfectly 
Exactly what I need. 

I stand up to leave 
Throwing a wilted dandelion over my left shoulder 
Deciding I should pull a Card 
And who should I find but Temperance, the Daughter of The Reconcilers 
Top Right corner, floating, over her left shoulder 
A
 Bee.

Out to the Warring Warren Garden 
Opening the Door, out, out briefly 
Can indelibly ink-stained hair of dog finds me 
It’s BoBo again, 
Guarding – 
The truest Warden 
My heart, rising 
Kissing, cuddling 
Touch so consensual 
Welcome slobber 
Sobering 
But seeing the bloodstain vine be ripped from the walls of this place 
Out from bedroom windows 
Once belonging to Louise 
The Careful Crab, my Maestra 
Now departed, now flighted, 
Gratefully 
Great hail falling, I see veins of vines remaining 
And here, 
Remaindered 
I take a picture, try to capture the Falling
Falling 
Hope 
Falling 
And then, there he comes 
The Thalia to my Melpomene 
His Comedy my Tragedy. 
Literally standing astride this beautiful dog, holding him captive 
He asks for me to take a picture, 
Of the dog between his legs 
And in doing so places his middle fingers down, down, down at me 
I see what you are doing, Mark, 
Stain
I say 
No, I don’t want that on my phone
The ‘that’ referring to his number 
Which I know is his truest reason

The End of my never-ending story 
The labyrinthine Library 
Of Borges 
Not infinite, but circular, 
Unending 
I think of that most important healing dream 
Where Millie, the Mill 
The Grain of Will 
I miss her 
That dream 
Where she, running down an impossibly steep 
Bicycle trail upon which I was skating 
Vertically 
Upward, 
In the middle place we meet 
Speechless, I stop 
She places her soft chocolate brown head 
Brown eyes 
Deep, 
Unconditional loving, seeing every part of me 
Upon my legs (now seated on the sideways ground, no prevailing thought of gravity) 
And sniffing like so oft I did 
The unmissable, delicious scent of my favourite living being ever to have walked this earth 
Oh God, Oh Goddess, this little chunky fluffy thing 
I miss you, sweetest one 
She rests her head upon my lap and I kiss her and in that moment in between the infinitely divisible eternity, a moment, infinite, 
We are saying farewell, 
Or, at least, 
Until next time – 
And then, in an instant, or eventually, 
This lab – latin – laboratorium – laborare – to work – 
She Worked her paws off in my therapy 
And in that Pause 
That moment, on the celestial street 
The bike lane split into duality; left for her, right for me – 
The Gears of this unworkable piece of key of locked alchemy 
Descending, ascending 
Her transition, my continuing 
The line a bound
Airy 
And now I realise, the surrounding plain 
A facsimile 
Of edinburgh’s The Meadows 
Meadow 
Opening 
A clearing 
A jarring 
Tapping 
At my chamber door 
The patient advocate 
Three weeks too late 
Or right on time 
I tell her most of what has happened 
And met by mostly compassionate reflection 
With twinges 
Of unhinging doubt, without her knowing, maybe 
I pull a card for her, The Knight of Pentacles 
Two shields, one at the heart, one at the knee – 
She speaks of the idea of a forest, unprompted;
We speak of a forest of unheard, felling trees – 
Telling me
The bad news, Good news, 
The Rocking in the Corner of this Hardest of Places

I left Three tapes scattered in the trees, 
Outside the façade of this ward 
I read her Heart, not wanting or expecting 
Anything in return anymore 
Not as a human, but in the exchange of patient to advocate 
Advocacy 
Vocalising silent melodies 
But
Bitterly 
She didn’t write 
A single thing
Down.
And then 
A sighing groan 
With the immediate and intrusive entry 
Of Sara
The fucking fake ass HCA 
asking to take my food order 
Which yesterday, was apparently baked beans 
Addressing the issue, she laughs mockingly 
And the room fills with the most wretched stench of inauthenticity 
I sit atop my windowsill, as far away from her and towards closeness of the closest to fresh air as possible in this metastasising small sized cell 
She stands back, right foot clad in podiatric soulless sole landing upon my carefully rolled artworks 
Leaving a stain 
a
Mark 
I tell her to leave, the room is filled with bad energy 
She says I’m sorry I didn’t mean to embarrass you, I’m sure 
No embarrassment here, at least not for me, I reply. 
I truly do not know who here is here to help me. Or if they even can. Maybe this place is literally just a melting pot of ash and mold and sepsis, meant as a ruthless crucible, 
In which those of us on the bound
Aries
Must Find our own integration 
Never coming back again 
Never coming back again
Maybe those of us put through this are the ones who truly never have to.

Walking back,

Please – I just want to be alone tonight – 
How could I ask anyone to love me when all I do is beg to be Left –

Claire in my periphery, trying to sweep up the mess of all the little snacks these lovely hurting little animals wrongfully in their respective bear traps 
I need to do my own laundry I don’t have enough detergent for the Others who keep Othering me and it’s not 
Trans
Actional or based upon their beliefs of me existing authentically or not at all I just simply need to do my own laundry else I’ll start to reek 
Auld Reekie 
Edinburgh Calling
Remembering my father, driving me up there for the initiation of my PhD 
Seven Years A
Go 
in Two Thousand and Seventeen 
20 – The Last Judgement 
17 – The Star. 
Christ, Lord, these Seven years have just been fucking insane 
He hasn’t even seen my face 
I don’t think he’ll ever call me by my name 
The last time I saw him 
The last time we spoke properly 
(in fact we’ve attempted resonance through voice since but both have been a butt dial on his part; 
I suppose I must still be the first number in his phone)  
The last time I saw his face
In/Out of memory 
Meaning – Missing - What did you ever mean to me? 
The Real Me 
Did you ever really see her?


Claire asks about the tape I gave her, I tell her I need to buy a tape player and get it sent here anyway to continue my loop experiments 
The one I brought with me can only playback at unpredictable and sporadic speeds, due to the mods made by The Person I cannot stop thinking about, It cannot record anything new 
It cannot record anything new but it remains a portal to the Passed – 
I carry Water 
Chop
Wood 
I carry Water 
Chopping Wood 
I Carry, War 
TERFs
Chopping 
Wooden Nesting Dolls 
Stillness, recursive, iterative 
The bath running, 
Hands up thighs 
Hot – 
The water 
I say, aloud, still shaken, tense of neck and barely 
Bear 
Lee
Breathing 
Looking down at what shouldn’t be 
Between these Saplings Scarred Ash Sacred Trees 
Grounding me to the Earth onto which I was Plaiced 
Replaced 
The Golden Idol with a bag of sand 
Look, look over there 
Do not look down here, don’t look don’t look, don’t feel 
I say aloud:
I can’t handle another surgery 
And crumble into cold hard not-quite porcelain 
Beige unwavering beigeness of the bathroom tiling, and a curved glass Marked with toothpaste or pus or blood spat out or burgundy ink not quite dried from my previously burgeoning bathed fingertips that burns the boundary (It’s probably unshatterable, knowing this place) 
And then 
A message 
A silly little message 
David 
It’s a screenshot of a tweet by Mount Eerie 
Oh
My heart 
What I find 
Will be found easily 
And only when I’m
Not looking for it 
Wihout looking 
For 
The Mourning 
In the Sun 
Set – 
Lights
Camera
Transaction 
And it’s like this that my Will 
To Live
Evil
Hides
Skin 
Implied, Impaled in my heart 
Art
Beating 
Without looking for Fulfilment, but just – 
Justice 
Balance 
Heart on Scales of Maat
Malika Maht
The Queen is Helpless 
Am I making her so?
Accepting it 
And oh, what’s this, is this my heart and is it thumping oh my heart oh there you are I stopped Hunting
Bearly 
I thought 
You would be as big as a Wail
My nets
Were knit 
Knotted 
My harpoons armed – I had my ship sailed 
Sunken 
Sunken Drunken Assault 
Oh, my heart, there you are, stow away stolen I stopped looking 
I stopped looking and there you came upon me 
Lightning strike had found the thing to crack against 
The space between my legs oh sleepy heart what do you say I’m trying as I try to hear as I try to hear you as I try to be Her I failed I failed to be her I should not have tried Why did I lie in that wide, wide bed crying when, both naked, you told me you loved me and maybe my tears were a lesson, a prophecy – 
Probably. 
Telling me this could have never been oh god, Oh god when will it stop hurting 
It hurts more than the countless after times in that Sapphire 
Velvet 
Soft Vastness 
Of your crinkled pyjamas and the headboard 
Head 
Bored 
Did you just 
Get bored? 
Did you just think I needed something urgent, something intense 
Were you trying to light my matching fire 
To get me out, out brief candle?
What’s left, I scream 
To no
Body 
But this empty Room, Seventeen 
Bound
Bound
Aries 
Abound, faeries – what gives – what gives and there’s no answering sound and there’s no Body a Round Red Ring and there my Answer, in the Question that leads to every Other 
This Othering 
Was
Found. 

And Sarah tells me, to such burning tears in my loving eyes regarding Guarding her Always 
That she Fought her Fight 
Fought Burns with Fire 
Stood her Ground
And Escaped her Wrongful Sectioning 
Section

Truth
How oft the light of truth be cast as –
Darkness
