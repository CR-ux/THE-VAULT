DAY SIXTEEN
DAY OF THE TOWER
Feeling of The universe. 
The Great One Of The Night Of Time.
XX
I
Am
Man Has Forgotten His Symbols 
Thinking God Is Dead 
But Women 
They Don’t Need To Remember 
Symbols Which Flow i/o of Them 
And Here, 
Hear – 
In the Waiting Place.
Every
Body
Is Just 
Weighting - 
Full circle 
Ring
Parallel 
No longer paralysed, 
Outside 
A man whistles at me as I write 
I do not look up 
I do not look up 
I have much, much 
Better things 
On my mind


Looking up, seven trails left by mechanical hundred tonne birds 
Intersecting into the Seven of Swords 
Lord 
LADY 
Of valour 
The Man
Baritone 
Sits next to me 
The distance between us shortening 
Sophia must have got through to him 
Even in her absence, 
The queen leaves, in this autumning world 
Such gravity of presence 
Circling the Earth with Grace 
Not quite circular, 
Much more nuanced than that 
Much less imposing
But in the so-called imperfection
much, much more powerful
A much more feminine curve 
Oval 
Latin – Ovum 
– Egg

I provide some comforting words to the Man In Baritone as he sits, sort of next to me, but two steps lower. 
I close my book, having written the words “blinding light”
And he speaks about his Glaucoma 
I offer him guidance on his imminent getting out of here 
On his budding connection to Sophia (both human and Spirit) 
He mentions the secular God of Nature 
And it brings a tear to my eye 
The shadow of a single sparrow passes by 

Back into Garden Wing
Forking -
Fucking Garden Wing
In the Walled, Walled Titular Garden 
Of this Broken and So Severely Severed Wing 
I See The Man From The Pagoda 
Not A King 
Not a Knight 
Not a Bishop or a Rook 
But just a lowly pawn 
Trying his best to rally his army 
He comments, as usual, on my body
This Body Which He Cannot Claim 
And Then His Gaze Decides to Fall Upon my Feet 
And dissect the aesthetic of my shoes
I reply, in stillness, something about standing my ground 
Standing Firm on the Earth 
And as the insipid conversation reels on 
Him Trying to Grasp, unravel, thread by thread, my Own Woven Tapestry 
Interrupting, Unheard for Once 
I see His own feet tapping, 
Tapping 
A beat that speaks: 
Speaks, booms and shouts
But Quieted
Quietly 
A verse on nerves
His nervousness 
Around the Strength of my Conviction. 

--
I turn over the Old Leaf of paper adorning my door, once depicting a well-intentioned though eggshell-steppingly naïve sentiment 
Encapsulated in Aesop’s fable of The North Wind and The Sun:
[IMG]
But the opposite of The Sun is not the North Wind 
It’s much more nuanced and filled with the flow of feminine than that 
I turn this flimsy fallen leaf of whiteness over 
The glue-dots collecting ripped out strands of my long black hair 
And I write
[IMG]
Shoving a torn out empty poor-intentioned sentiment from the welcome leaflet of the Hospital, something about giving patients the voice to express themselves, and can barely contain my exasperated sigh 
Middle English – sighen – to Heave -  a Deep Breath – To Groan – Old High German – sīhhan – Old Norse – síkja – Lament 
I Will Continue To Carry This Wait 

And in the Ovum of the Exit 
The Disembodied Birds Eye View of The Pumping Beading Budding Heart 
A Creaking Gate 
The Opened Pulse, The Dying Blooms
The Fall of Man -
The birds
They are singing 
In time with my song
As I sit here in the shade of a tree
Protected from the Sun 
But Warmed, no less, by His Overwhelming Flame 

And I think about that poor, little boy 
The White King 
Now realising, yes, The White King. 
He 
Was My White King All Along 
The Poor, poor Little Rich Boy 
Only able to move within the One Square of This Place 
Bound by the Walls of That Fucking Garden 
With only one path of splintered stone 
Step, Step, Steppenwolf 
Stepping as best he can within the restrictions of His Own Fear 
Oh Poor, Poor Boy 
You Must Be So Scared 
[WAV]
Without a Sisterhood 
Without even a Mother 
Parallel
Though unlike mine, she may have visited 
She didn’t see you once, did she? 
She put you here, like your Father
Farther
Closer 
Too Close – the answer. The problem. The solution. 
To the Question that No Body Here Seems To Be Asking 
May these words protect you, White King 
May My Words Shimmer Shine Through The Window to Your Palace of White 
May This Song I sing amidst the Larks 
And the Dove you Likely Slayed 
Collide upon the spirals of your inner, inner ears, 
Reach your scared and shaking beating heart 
That beats in rhythm under mine 
Under Mines
Mining Ore 
Or 
Stone
The Stone of What You Reminded Me 
I think of Giles Corey 
Waiting 
Under Weight 
More Weight 
Asking for More Weight 
Wait – 
Answers are coming
The heavy Light of Answers are already here 
In the Pages, in the Words of the Pages 
In the Letters that I’m Sending in These Words of All My Pages 
I no Longer leave my book Open to You, 
But I will not Close it, Poor sweet little Boy 
I refuse to Close it, rather 
Leave the lock unlatched 
Take down the makeshift paper security blanket 
Adhered to edges of my doorway 
And I think, Janus
January 
The newness of the Year of this Universe 
Looking forward to the Past 
And to the Future, looking back 
Eurydice dissolving 
As Orpheus Ore 
Digs Himself into Holes of His Own Making 
Oh, Men, 
Oh the Men that Put Me Here 
How I Sing Not For You But For The Rhythm You Cannot feel 
Deep, Deepening, Deeper
A blustering violence of a diesel engine, roaring Lion to the Lioness of Leaves 
Surrounding me in this Arboretum 
Fetal Sounds so Innocent 
So ready to accept vicarious guilt 
Guilt transferred 
Transgender Girl 
You Don’t Need A Mother 
You Are The Mother of All 
So hold it all, my Love 
Hold it all within and in the holding 
Let the Autumn Fall it All, so Boldly 
Gently, Gently 
And Quickly! Sister! 
What You Are About to Do! 
You Must Do Quickly! 
The Time has passed too viscously 
And You Are Not The Rock Worn By The River
You Are Not The Banks That Watch it Pass 
You Are The Water 
Flowing Fast 
So Quickly, Quickly, Out the brief candle 
Of the Reddened Ringing Oval 
Of Your So Necessary Hurting Past 
Hurtling 
Past 
Everything That Refuses to Move 
Move 
Move 
Move 
Move 
Move 
Move 

In the Café
I bump into Sophia 
And ask her if she wants that Tarot Reading
I open my wooden box of cards, now filled with dewy fresh Rose Petals from a wilting flower found on the Melodic path of my earlier Movement
I finish the reading, 
The Moon in reverse in the East 
The Water in Fire 
A good sign for her budding Romance 
Bud
But
Halfway through the reading 
I feel a sweeping cloud of fog come over me, 
And realise a presence is to my right 
A leering, gravitational presence which sucks every waft of breath from the weft of my lungs 
A warping, warped presence 
I hear, somewhere distant, this person ask to speak to Lindsay, who is sat to my sinistral side 
To the West, 
To the Water of my Heart 
To this beautiful feminine Mother of All 
This fellow spooling Pool of empathy I have been so grateful to get to know 

And Lindsay says:
(I’m so proud of her)
“No.” 
Oftentimes, the hardest Word for a woman to say 
(I think of, and push down - 
All the memories of times I wished I’d said no)
The presence leaves 
And I reflexively flick my arms in a swatting gesture
As if punctuating the exit of a plague of locusts 
Filled with rot and disease and looking for more decaying flesh to feast upon 
Then, once the reading is done 
Lindsay tells me the Form this fog  took
It was the Little White Rich King’s Mother 
The 
White 
Queen 
The Source of What Little Power He Believed He Held 
And Lindsay relays the messages pouring through the High Priestesses Group Chat 
Our digital space of Holy Communion 
Our Covenant in Code 
That apparently, this Woman 
This… Supposedly Devout Christian person 
Had been encouraging This Little Boy 
To Kill Animals 
“He should start with Deer” she had said 
Doe
A 
Dear

A Female 
Dear 
Ray – 
A 
Dropping of my pulse 
My heart, breaking for him – 
The Sun 
Behind such a thick, putrid 
Cloud
Lindsay expresses her vehement repulsion at the idea of talking to this person 
Her obvious disdain at my Spiritual practice 
Her supposed Holiness, a Hollow, A Horrible 
Hole. 
Just such an ironic reflection of the Demons she Resists 
The lack of integration 
The disconnection to Divinity 
And then Richard, 
Sophia’s newfound love 
Comes in
Asking for his own reading 
And I say 
(I’m so proud of myself)
“No.”
But then. 
I laugh at myself, my own sense of resistance 
And call him back, finding the grey 
Oval
In this checkerboard of so-called ‘Women’ and ‘Men’
Of Flesh-checkered Humans Filled with pipes and organs pumping Blood of the Covenant and Holding so much Water of this Womb of Earth and Air, the Breath of God in us all just going In/Out, In/Out, Out
Into the Opener Air 
The grey I find in his reading – 
A single Card 
A compromise. 
And what card should arrive, 
But
The Lovers. 



As I write this
Richard himself 
Arrives in the reflection of my screen
Telling me I’ve left my sunglasses 
In the Café. 
The shadow left behind 
And I look towards the light 
And see a Fox 
Creep so Cleverly 
Quietly 
underneath the hole in the Fence in front of me 
The Fence 
Which sits next to the Ten 
Deka
Miles Per Hour 
Surrounded
By a Red 
Ring 
Above
The Parallel 
Parking Spaces 
Of this Unspeakably
Harmful 
And Ineffably
Healing 
Place
 



The women ask for my help 
It’s all gone tits up 
They say 
I don’t know when the tits have ever been down 
I think
Rushing to get dressed from my bath, where I was conceptualizing the plot of this novel, I find the other women
They tell me they’ve been gaslit all day 
(I have been squirreled away, in the grounds, avoiding The White King for my Own safety)
Building energy
Boundaries 
We enter into a necessary 
Heartbreakingly necessary 
Buddy system 
For the night 
I remember my horoscope 
Stay up and Fight 
And I think I’ll listen to 
the Stars
Seventeen 
 this evening 
And I resolve to skip my quetiapine, 
Stay awake 
With my razor 
Bought at the store at the midpoint of that terrifying walk in the Dark 
Where I felt as alone as I’d always felt 
The blade, this time, company 
Of a different kind. 

No longer embodying the martyr 
I assume the strength of the central position 
Control of the Board 
In this Ward 
A Ward 
A Warden 
Of this Fucking 
Walled
Garden 

Razor in Pocket 
 I walk to the dining hall with Ciz 
And we ask what’s for dinner 
I take a moment to appreciate her comfort in eating next to me 
And realise, again, 
God – how many times must I realise before I concretise 
The fact that I have the control over how others perceive me 
And if I don’t; 
Then the truest truth at the seed of the heart of the fruit:
The only perception that matters 
Is that of my Own 
Of My Self 
I ask The Cafeteria worker how she is this evening 
She says 
Fine thank you, Sir
I say:
Not sir, but we all make mistakes 
And we move on. 
I’m proud of you
Ciz says 
I gently
Gently 
Touch her arm 
Knowing the scars, still fresh as the Rose Petals inside my box of Cards 
Lie in weight underneath her thin cardigan 
And I reciprocate the sentiment 
I’m proud of us. 
And I really, 
Fucking 
Am. 
In the background, we see the transphobic HCA cower, 
Peel back like the skin of a rotten fruit – 
And I say, loud enough for everyone to hear 
Isn’t it interesting 
How when you stand up for what’s right 
You notice those who defend the darkness of this world 
Those complicit in its darkness 
Fall away 
When you are your most authentic self 
The most inauthentic 
Miraculously
Dissolve from view 
Into the periphery of your glimmer. 


And now is the time 
To distribute that energy, fairly 
\Where it is needed most
Utiliising the only ‘privilege’ I have here 
(ha)
Their Ignorant, directly harmful misperception 
Of me as the gender of my assailants
Their perception of me as a man 
Can finally be put to use
She sits down, this sycophantic, fake person 
Immediately addressing me, by name
And only me
Asking to take my breakfast order 
This is her attempt at confrontation 
I say 
Well
It never gets put through anyway 
(Only exactly four times, 
Four knives
Wooden – 
We aren’t allowed metal cutlery - 
has the kitchen received my food order since I have been here)
She sighs, loudly, 
And tries to divert the conversation away from the very real neglect that is putting these women in danger.
She asks
Haven’t seen much of you today, Nima 
I say
Well that’s because I don’t feel safe on the ward, as I said to you this morning
She has the overt audacity 
To say you know you can tell me anything 
I say 
We’ve tried, 
Sarah. 
All the women keep trying to tell you how unsafe we feel, 
And yet, 
You have taken this dangerous man
Boy
Off 1:1 observation 
Leaving us unguarded for the whole evening. 


And she says;

No need to be facetious 
I think, I’m not being facetious at all
But, sure, I’ll meet you where I’m at 
The Time For The Sun Has Passed 
Now, 
Long
Live 
The Moon. 
And so, I reflect this glare, this ironic lack-of-safety back at her 
Saying, 
Quickly, quickly, What I’m About To Do I Do Quickly - 
Did you know that facetious is one of the words of the English language that has all the vowels in the right order?
She sits, hands shaking, 
Silent. 
And she leaves, 
Not taking any of the other women’s food orders. 

Stay Up. 
Stay up and Fight. 

Susan, another Nurse Ratched Facsimile 
Calls me to the medication room 
At first, I ask what time it is 
Paranoid that they might be trying to send me to sleep early 
Before realising, it’s just my IBS medication she’s reminding me to take 
Funny, I never get reminders for my estrogen 
Are you alright, I ask, half-heartedly 
Be The Moon
I’m at a zero, she replies 
I stifle a laugh 
And ask, what’s the matter?
Nothing we’re going to talk about
She says 
Well, 
I reply
If you feel the urge, you know where to find me 
And I even have a recording device! 
I see her try to hide her frozen face 
Not by the cold, unforgiving dryness 
Of the Refrigerator Room that is the Clinic
To keep the medicines, the tranquilisers 
The tape over our mouths safe
As if to say:
Save Our Holes
Keep these tools of censorship in date 
Safe
Locked 
By a combination too long to memorise 
Or contemplate 
Safer than the women, the humans 
these mouths belong to 
will ever be 

And so I yield this field recorder 
Like a shield 
An accountability machine, 
And its resemblance to a taser does not go unnoticed 
What 
A lucky 
Little 
Coincidence 




Walking past 
The Man From The Pagoda 
Who keeps making a joke about ‘being a gay man who likes women’
So I joke
Be The Moon
Meet Them Where They’re At
Is that Grindr, Mark?
No, it’s tinder, he tries to retort 
I thought you were a ‘gay man’ I say 
I thought you were a nice guy
I hear him mutter 
So I trace back my steps left behind 
Get as close as he thinks he can get to us 
And say
What was that?
My field recorder in range 
He mutters it again, followed, 
Quickly 
by a cowardly “It was a joke”
It was a transphobic joke, I say 
Oh, please
He blutters in his disgusting usual tone of misogyny, now poisoned with another, deeper layer of violence 
Yes Mark, Please. Stop. 
He then says 
Trust me, I’m not the kind of person you want to mess with 
And so I say
Was that a threat, Mark?
And walk into the clinical suite, microphone visibly in hand 
I write down everything. Everything. 
In manic scrawl to the trusted
I thought trusted
HCA 
As she dispenses part of my medication
I refuse the sleeping pill, when asked my reason, I say, to be in control of my own body tonight, to stay up, to know, to be awake in case anything happens 
On leaving the Tundra of that room 
I see all the women huddled round him like a little baby just been born 
And he’s jittering like a pathetic little predatory animal malnourished and at the same time overweight 
He feigns a public ‘apology’, his excuse ‘I’m just slurry’
What the fuck does that mean
I say 
I accept your apology Mark, but I won’t be sleeping tonight 
Because you, and the men in here have made the women feel very unsafe 
And the staff have done nothing but entrench that sense of danger
But let me tell you 
Microphone waving like a teacher of the Victorian era might wave a cane or a pointing stick 
I’m not some 
Body
You want to mess with, either 
And I
DO
Mean it. 
Exiting this toxic space I walk back to my room 
And the group chat falls to a more chilling, terrifying silence than I’d ever felt 
To counter, I try to heat my body
With hotter, hotter bath water 
Hold me, please hold me
Hot and steaming body of water 
Please
Just hold me 
Some 
Body  
Hold
Me

--

Outside, 
To The Garden 
Gethsemane 
I see the White King, toppled 
By Some Known Hand 

Is this Surrender 
Or is this a shroud of surrender 
To Hide The Realest Threat of All 
Is This The Endgame 
Or is this 
The Beginning of the Real Fight 
The Medium Sensing Wreckage 
The Endgame’s ticking chess clock?
Is this a message, screaming silently
Through Walls and Walls and Walls and Walls and Walls through to my Room Seventeen 
Through the flimsy Lock I build nightly 
Through the artificial pine, the pining barrier 
To the Fading Grace of the Dark Queen 
The box I closed her in 
The Red Ring I Paralysed her with
Is this a Sign, a Sentinel
Is this a Semaphore? A metaphor? 
A Crashing Symbol unto Me:
The Playing Games of Skill and 
Foxes Boxing Degloved Cleverness 
The Time for flight to follow legs
 left amputated in their Hollow
The Time for children’s dressing grown 
Up roads of Bacteria and Ash
The Time for lavish lack and lies
Righteous Anger left unanswered - 
And slander Under Dice’s Chance 
 is Over, through,
and Sky – 
and Sparrow – 
And Holy Bee-Stung Arrow 
and Now - 
It’s Time To Die.
