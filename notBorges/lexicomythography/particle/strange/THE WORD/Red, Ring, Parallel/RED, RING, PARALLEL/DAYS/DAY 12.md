DAY TWELVE

I awake from the dream 
Taking the apple stalk I’d left from last night’s ritual between my teeth 
I ask the nurse who knocks on my door and asks me if I’m feeling better this morning if “Red, Ring, or Parallel mean anything to [her]”
No, she says 
Telling me to google dream interpretations 
I put on my cloak 
A traveler 
I wrap it tightly about my burgeoning body 
I follow the two nurses in the corridor, complimenting one of their pinafores 
“you have a good eye for fashion” she says 
Fashion. 
The dream trickles through as I walk 
A new tarot deck
Wrapped in a fishnet stocking 
Wirth a ring with fluid in it 
Like one my mother used to have 
And keep breaking 
Three
I asked was it from leamington 
No
She said 
Whoever it was I was talking to 
It’s from a shop called parallel 
I looked up 
And it was right there in front of me 
Hiding in plain sight 
A group of us sat on the floor 
ON the cobblestones 
Clear day 
Fishing rod fashioned from a stick 
With a crab as bait 
On the end of it 

On a street that looked like it was Edinburgh’s west bow 
The glass ring was clear, filled with fluid
But had a red circle inside of the circular disk
It had a smaller ring inside of it 
I had to bend the arms of the ring to fit my finger 
I remember saying my mother used to have a bunch of these 
And they’d break all the time 
She bought them in Leamington
Was it from Leamington? I asked 
No, they said 


I was at a summer camp
Like camp they do in America
I had to throw my razor out the window 
Because they were about ti find it 
And kick me out permanently
It was contraband. 
And I didn’t want to be thrown out 
They were cleaning my room 
As I lay, depressed, unable to move in a bed inside a wardrobe 

There was a musical number
With Tammie brown 
They were singing songs about 
Not letting them see your sadness
White sheet 
White cloak 
Like a ghost
A Halloween costume 
New tarot deck 
Wrapped in a Fishnet stocking 
Red

I walk outside 
Quickly 
I place the apple stalk atop the shrouded body 
Of the pigeon I laid to rest two days prior
I sit down on the bench, open to whatever comes 
Take a sip of my coffee 
In the tilting of my still-sore neck 
I see the moon
Above me
Clear – 
Halved 
Hiding in plain sight
Semicircle 
I’M NOT A CHILD BECAUSE I AM NOT WHOLE BUT BECOMING IN KNOWING THAT
I see a 10mph sign – surrounded by a red ring 
I walk towards it 
A portal 
Keep walking 
A single red petal on the ground before me 
I pick it up 
Wet
Cold 
I place it in my book
Keep walking 
I see the sign for the hospital 
Realising the “O” forms a red circle in the centre 
Of
The Word
Red
Ring 
I see an opening in the trees 
I walk into it 
Mulch and leaves giving way underfoot 
And at my foot 
An inexplicable red string 
I pick it up and place it inside my book 
Another step
Another string
I pick it up and place it inside my book 
Another step 
One last red string 
I pick it up and place it inside my book
I hear a rustling above me 
A squirrel 
Gathering leaved branches, quickly, quickly, 
Scurrying 
Leaping from branch to branch 
Another red sign, next to the parallel parking spaces 
Parallel
I walk towards it 
VEHICLES AND CONTENTS ARE LEFT AT THE OWNERS OWN RISK 
Risk
Red
Red
Red
Parallel
I keep walking 
A holly bush 
Red berries 
Pyramus, Thisbe 
I pick a red (sphere) 
Berry 
I place it in my palm 
I pick another red berry 
I placed it in my palm 
I pick one last red berry 
I place it in my palm 
I keep walking 
To the next 
Parallel
Parking space 
A red car drives past 
Red
I follow it 
Back to the hospital reception 
Holding the door open for a lady running towards me
“It’s too early to be running!” I joke 
She laughs, thanking me 
And in the reception, 
This gatekept liminal homing pigeon ground 
A flock
A murmuration 
A murder of people 
Scurrying, hurrying at the end of their shift 
Ready to go home 
I hug one of the nurses imploring her to get some sleep 
There are more busying bodies in this place than I’ve seen since arriving 
Back to my room 
I place the three red berries on three of the six pentacles I drew during my tarot reading last night 
Two of the red strings I place, in parallel, above and below the set of three cards 
The third, I place perpendicular, connecting the two 
Through the middle of the three berries 
And I place the red petal atop the reversed Five of Swords 
Rising 
Rising 
Red
Ring
Parallel
Rising. 


Today is the day it all changes.

My first group (which had more than me in it) 
Understanding emotions
Triangle is the strongest shape 
Even with one stable parent, it’s not enough 
Understanding how much has not been enough 
Understanding how much has been misunderstood 
Because the body 
\this Body 
Was made to be broken 
Made to be misunderstood
A body, made inearnest 
The so-called coincidence 
The intersection point of the caduceus of Memory and Meaning 
Pointing to the Truth 
The Shakespearean Farce, apparently pervading every name of every character here, no different in the case:
Luna. 

In the Female Lounge, we gather 
Lindsay and I bring our lamps from our respective bedrooms, carrying them down the corridors like mirrored copies of copies of the Hermit Card 
I see two tech staff coming from my room 
Holding a toaster 
I make a silly suicide joke 
They laugh 
I come back, the TV I use to extend my screen has been turned off 
And a flash of worry – 
The HCA had asked me, before dinner, where I write my book
And I told her
On my laptop 
Is this paranoia? 
Is this real?
Is any of this real?
Last night felt more dreamlike than a dream
More real than non-fiction

Most of us gathered inside the Lounge 
Like a dysfunctional family at Christmas 
Playing card games and cracking 
Lightning
Glass
Ring
Red
Parallel
Jokes,
Rosanna (nana) 
Saying we should play strip poker, but with a twist, 
All of us putting more and more clothes on 
She couldn’t hold her laughter 
I couldn’t hold my tears
It felt like this thing 
What’s it called 
Family
Before
 the handover to the night staff rolled over 
like the crumbling of a cold, saline, shivering wave 
Into an unforgiving ocean  
The sea of reality 
Reminding me 
With his rolling eyes 
(over, under, we can’t get over, we’ve got to go) 
At my simple request to be let to the vending machine  
To gather sugary supplies for our makeshift thrifted state shifting Christmas dinner 
And with his loud sigh in reply I said 
Y’know what, nevermind 
Turning round to head back into the low-lit living room 
Where I thought about living 
Where I’d thought, maybe living 
Where I’d thought maybe living didn’t have to be so fucking lonely 
But no
The salt mill turned again
(And oh, how I wished I’d been able to hide my tears) 
Becauyse of course 
This little newfound fledgling tribe of mine
Rushed around and about my thinning shaking shoulders 
The night dissolving into the chaos that to the each of us was so much more familiar 
Than the soreness of belly 
And stretching of cheeks 
And forbidden appling of cheeks in smiling at one another’s difference 
Difference converging, convalescence of Becoming Family 
And one by one we left the room 
And I couldn’t help but feel responsible
But back alone in Room 17 
Where once again I piled the hard suitcase, my tape recorder’s flight case and my shoes 
Into a sort of lock 
(I’d really become quite good at this, you see) 
To prevent entry of any nocturnal visitor 
Daughtered by this awful fortress 
Fathered, rather 
Farther 
Farther 
The haze of medication, sinking 
Sinking 
The blushing hue I’d forgot to wash from my bathroom sink still pinking 
Sheer, 
In sight 
The only light, from the bathroom 
My lamp still in that room 
That memory that never happened 
Which was the truest thing I’d ever felt 
Dancing with Rosanna to Lady in Red 
Her telling me I belonged on the cover of vogue 
The Man from The Pagoda cracking jokes 
Like Lightning 
Nourishing 
Because I let it be 
Opening 
Amethyst crystal falling the moment I was dealt my cards 
I suppose I should have felt its weight 
Falling into my lap 
And seen it as a sign 
A retrocausal reminder 
Of why 
We all 
Were here
