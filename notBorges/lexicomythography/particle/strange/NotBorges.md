4. **LayerNB:** Noet Borges writes a series of incredibly flowery and heartfelt love letters to a Pantheonic Polymathecule; a polymathephemeral group of figures spanning different time periods; all of whom are thinking of breaking up with him/excommunicating him from the Polymathecule. Their “Dear Jorges” letters are probably the narrative complement in the overarching palindrome of the meta-narrative structure. With every letter sent to the Nine of the Ennead Polymathephemerulcra, more is revealed about this Realm of What For’s, as a metaphysical analog of Borges’ library of Babel condensed into every hexagonal nucleotide sub-molecular structure of DNA itself, each member of the Polycule a librarian of a Branch, the overall zoomed out appearance being of a Wunderhorn passing through and playing itself in 3D space- A Klein Bottle (or deine kleine Klein Wunderhorn). One of the librarians is “shelving” a school of thought, (school conceptualised as schools of fish searching for different “books” or scrambled amalgams of memories “Semantograms” to make their respective “Points”) and this school is known as Aesthetic Hermeticism, coined by: [[Æ-Æcademy of Æschertology]]
