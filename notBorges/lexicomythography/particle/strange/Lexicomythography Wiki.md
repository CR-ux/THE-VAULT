# Lexicomythography[^f]
*Lexicomythography* is the knot-pseudo-but-sudo-scientific-noes-Art of creating recursive, self-referential systems of meaning through the interplay of language, myth, and narrative. It examines how stories and symbols are interwoven into structures that reflect and refract their own processes of creation. The field is characterized by its focus on lexDefs—definitions that recursively define themselves within a larger mythic or symbolic framework. [[Sudo]][^p] [[Knot]] See: [^Bibliography]
## Key Concepts
1. **The Ineffable Begetter**: The primal act of naming or creation that initiates recursion.[^C]
2. **The Guileless Child**: The playful, emergent lexicon of self-referential definitions (lexDefs).[^L]
3. **The Cradling Veil**: The mythic framework that holds and contextualizes the lexicon while obscuring its[^A] ultimate origin.
## Applications
- **Literature**: Explores the recursive nature of storytelling, where narratives define and redefine themselves.
- **Metaphysics**: Examines how meaning {is createdmoves(physic-emotionally)} through interconnected systems.
- **Word Game Design**: Provides a framework for immersive, self-referential linguistic worlds that invite interaction.
<br><br>**Recursive Scale (δ)**  The interplay of self-referential elements in language and meaning. <br> **Mythic Scale (ε)**     The integration of mythic structures into lexicons of meaning.      <br> **Symbolic Scale (ζ)**   The use of symbols and definitions as recursive, interlinked nodes.
