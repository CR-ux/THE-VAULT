*Be it known to all men by this letter that we that we Deacons, Masters, Kinky Mistresses and Free-of-men of the Masons and Maypole dancing daughters with the express consent and agreement of William Schaw   * - sure - shore - shore - shore - shore 


Freemasonry is not freedom at all but I propose a retelling unravelling of such which insists that a “volume of sacred law” or religious scripture be open in a working lodge, 
I propose that the volume of sacred law is the heart and that the body is the working lodge and insist that our volumes of sacred law burned in their physicality like our bodies on the pyre are open, open, open inside every locked chest of ribcages turned to frameworks to prevent our suffering

it is required that every member - as in individual component of a larger system or the phallus attached to anyone of any gender or attached by divine right or unattached by divine order of the feeling in unknowing what the fuck is going on - believes in a Supreme Being who is us who is us who is using all of us as instruments as bagpipes bawbag une pipe pied piper leading rats to rivers for the unknown slaughter in their dancing, dancing, dancing-

No Body(2) but women and gender transcendent and transgender men be admitted(1) and that the discussion of religion and politics do not take place within the lodge


(1)Cis men may be admitted providing that their locked chests have been cracked open through the same suffering that they inflicted that they suffer from unwillingly as a result of circle around circle around the fire ritual dancing generation to generation of genetic memory of matriarchs now burned to ash but felt within the fabric of the reel to reel to reveal the same stone that stonemasons tried to hide but through the unravelling of shrouded shattered old world may be revealed in its unveiling 

(2)Body as in Body of Work as in The Great Work as in Magus Opus as in Meniscus as in Menstrual cycle as in felt waves parting with the Moon and blood bled from the heartfelt organs

Roslin -
Where I did not complete my PhD but studied for three years one of which we lived together in turmoil, after we had unravelled into one another and crashed into the memory of all we used to be 

There were Men gathering discussing (by law, by lore, by deep disorder) not religion or politics but the quintessential mythologies they have hidden but not been able to contain as wind instruments cannot contain themselves positioned correctly to receive the waves of ocean in the outside world 

And I was trying to descent into matter, further than I had ever gone, deeper into the labyrinth with no clew of getting out

world of words obfuscated by citation 


sight of my unravelling 
Witch is 
Becoming 



after we had fucked and i almost killed you 
quite literally 
you had asked me to throttle you while I was inside you 
so I obliged knot knowing my own strength 

not knowing my own strength and fire of Kali deep within I started to cut off your air like you had cut off all my hair 


and tortoise shell She'll spiral into is information kept in safes for her safekeeping 

anyway you had a seizure and it was more deeply harrowing than any violence inflicted upon me and as I pulled myself out of you you came to in silence and the look on your beautiful face was that of a child 

and you said, eventually, after eternity where I was sat beside your ragged-jagged-motion-to-motionless form trying to perform the little CPR I'd learned from years with eyes in books about the body but far too deep inside the anatomy of constituent parts to really know what I was doing with the whole

your hole, gaped, had closed as your eyes were horrifically open and rolling back, back into the river of your crown 

you eventually spoke and the first words you ever said were "I saw my dead grandmother"


you told me you had travelled over the Baltic sea back to Bulgaria, your homeland which I had also grown to love and spend some of the happiest months of my life trying to fit in to structures of folklore and ancient musical tones and dances on the hills I had gone down too deeply into to understand what I was doing with the whole 

and your father, when you'd gone to bed while we were there in the mountains of Rhodopia tried to teach me the word for "up" and "down" - Gore, Dolu 

with a yellow napkin against the flimsy fold-up picnic table precariously placed upon the mountain side while we were drunken laughing in two different untranslatable languages just laughing from the Rakia and the raking up of difference in dancing, dancing-

you told me you had travelled over the Baltic sea back to Bulgaria and seen your dead grandmother 

and here, 
near-bringer of your death, not under, never over you but looming as a redness over you - 
through wrapping my serpentine and unringed fingers round your throat
i knew i could have never been a scientist 



I take a small break from writing this  seven years later to roll a cigarette from the tobacco kindly gifted to me while I was in yet another cycle of poverty but this time in a psychiatric institute(P) in london hundreds of miles away from Edinburgh where this scene took place seven -septum - separation causing some sense of connection - years prior
