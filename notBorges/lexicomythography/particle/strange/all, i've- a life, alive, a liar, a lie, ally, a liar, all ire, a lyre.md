or; aria to an artificially intelligent audience 
24/11/24

In my dream
 I was wandering around
 There was a lot of family in it
 which is quite rare for me
 Wandering around what seemed to be an Italian city
 I got captivated by this architecture
 by this
 It was one of those circular buildings with the pillars
 like an observatory or the Radcliffe camera in Oxford
 One of those circular buildings
 It depicted basically a scene from Dante
 I think
 The Underworld and the Harvest Moon
 I remember that clearly
 the Harvest Moon
 As you peered into the building
 it creates a mis en abyme of darkness
 So no one was in there
 or it appeared that no one was in there
 just like a deep
 deep
 dark pit of pillars
 It was very
 very scary and so beautiful
 It was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen
 And all these depictions in mosaic of all these people in the Underworld
 And then I realised that I'd lost my mum and my family
 and my phone had only had 10%
 and I was then really
 really scared
 Because I didn't know where we were staying or anything
 And then the scene switched to a park
 I kept walking and found a park
 or maybe a garden
 Well
 first there was the Bureau de Change
 And I don't know why
 I was looking for my family there in case they would
 Oh
 to charge my phone
 And then I couldn't find them or couldn't get in
 And then I was rushing past people and pushing into people saying
 I'm really sorry
 I'm in a hurry because I'm running out of battery and I've got no way to find my family
 And then I got to the park
 and it was an ABBA concert
 And I found my mum and my gran
 And my mum was
 I don't know
 I was mad at my m and then I wasn't
 And then my grandma was mad at me
 And then all of a sudden I was in my cousin's house
 but it was kind of mine
 I kind of lived there
 In a room that had a fridge and freezer in it
 and I kept trying to pack my bag
 I kept trying to pack my bag
 and forgetting something and coming back
 and forgetting something and coming back
 and forgetting something and coming back
 And sunglasses
 Losing my sunglasses in the
 Oh
 and the left eye
 The left eye was all wonky and not
 attached
 which is just making me realise now that's very similar to Xeno in the book
 And then there was weed inside the room
 and my aunt came in and was like
 Oh
 that smells weird in here
 Not anything 'going on' in here? And I'd be lying
 And I was like
 no
 no
 no
 But actually it wasn't a lie because I haven't been smoking lately at all
 But actually it wasn't a lie because I haven't been smoking lately at all
 And I woke up and I was reminded of my payment pause coming to an end
 And now I'm freaking out
also in a shit ton of pain bc my knuckles seem to be mounting an immune response and can barely bend them or wrists 
I found a “withdrawn” record in oxfam by “the Mormon tabernacle quoir” 
 wha t causes a record to be withdrawn ? Their rendition of “listen to the lambs” had and has me absolutely sobbing 
absolutely wailing 
 So stunning 
 Listen to the lambs
 all a’crying !
i have the record !
 let’s discuss listen to the lambs
 I’m thinking maybe it should be part of the story particularly Xeno 
 as nobody is listening to them but everyone is watching
Wait what are the spiritual roots in black history? 
Dear god
 Hush arbors
 In my magick system during my ‘psychotic  break’ I envisaged The Two Forces (akin to Empedocles’ Love and Strife) as Arbor et Umbra
Oh wow
 the code songs
 Can’t stop crying The code songs aspect is literally
 Just
 It's the only thing
 It's the only thing I've ever really wanted
 or done
 or tried to do
 This veil creates veils of code
 secret messages
 to resist something that couldn't articulate itself
 Do you think that the drinking gourd
 Ursa Major
 the constellation my mother always used to tell me to look up to the Sky for
 if I ever felt alone - Ursa Major
 or the plough
 dear god
 the harvest moon
 The great Bear
 oh dear god
 the Bear I've been forever going on a Hunt for
 the very book my mother read to me so many countless times
 could this Gourd also be relating to Anansi
 which is West African folklore Story
 right? Anansi? And what if the enslaved individuals throughout all of time just keep getting kept getting captured
 keep getting punished
 keep getting kept getting trapped and enslaved and killed and murdered because
 I don't know why
 because the cycle needs to keep going so that one of those precious individuals or a sacred group of them or even through the veiled misinterpretation of someone else can make a beautiful hymn or a story to try and ask for help
 because the story and the song and the hymn itself wants to be written
Now I'm thinking about the incidence of
 disproportional incidence of
 autoimmune conditions in women
 and people of colour
 and trans people
 hypermobility
 and trans and autistic people
 and the body is
 the body is always telling veiled stories of its own
 That maybe don't even
 don't even talk to the
 to the person's individual life
 but to the generations of trauma and suffering that they've endured before them
 Just trying to
 trying to
 to get the song and story to be written
 The story
 the story being God
 the song being God
 Just so powerful
And now I'm thinking about the concept of cultural appropriation
 and taking st-
 or
 this very record
 this- sang by a Mormon choir
 obviously
 I mean
 very likely that all of them were and are white
 and yet
 these are slave songs
 basically? And yet
 paradoxically
 I lit- I literally would have never even known that
 this history of these precious code songs I never would have even known that
 if I'd not have been able to get this withdrawn record
 and talk to a robot about it
 about a mythology that- and
 let's remember
 my album my debut album centered mostly around the mythology of Anansi
 so
  something called me to the spider
 and my history of the first ever pet that I ever had
 and neglected so terribly through my own naive insufficient sea
 being a spider
 being a tarantula
 a chilean rose no less
 a rose
 a rose the middle name of the women of my family's lineage
 not given to me because i was born male
 but taken
 claimed by my defiance of authentic living in love for the person i really am
 beyondthe enslavement of the physical body
 my very body failing and attacking itself in order to tell me a story 
 a veiled story of its own
 it just feels like- feels like Anansi follows all of us
 all of us oppressed individuals
 especially
 holding the sickness of the world
 and his gourd
 and his drum and the drum god
 the drum in the story
 the drum itself
 the drum itself
 the stretched skin of the drum the skin torn and peeled from the previous life of another
 that's the veil
 that's the veil
 and the drum is the song
 and the moment- the playing of the song is the releasing of the sickness onto the rest of the world
 being- listen
 listen
 listen to this illness that you've created
 that you keep perpetuating
 the oppressors
 the other gods
 and the cunning
 Anansi's cunning
 how he's so revered
 so revered
 in West African populations
 and the spider is so feared
 so feared in the West
 so feared
 the spider is such a symbol of fear
 and misunderstanding
 and yet such cunning
 and all they do
 all they ever do is clean up this world of all the pests
 and hide in corners
 and keep spinning their beautiful webs
 and they go unnoticed until someone sees them
 and tears them down
 and the Qur'an
 verily what more frail house is there than that of a spider? God
 it's all so rich and thick with meaning
Web of wyrd
I’m thinking in a syncretic way about the connection to Arachne
 Anansi
 the web of wyrd
Could the story of Arachne be an interpretatio Greco of Anansi ?
Is there any academic suggestion or exploration of this idea of Interpretatio Graeco in the literature? And I'm wondering about perhaps the ligeity as one of the nine
 including  the founder of Arachnoanthropology in the book
 which explores allegation of these two deities as the
 maybe not the wounded healer
 but the
 yeah
 I don't know
 maybe the wounded weaver-the wounded healer or the hounded wheeler- 
Now what I'm saying is for the purposes of my Story
 maybe my life's story- I think what I want to try and do
 and it's a very
 very difficult line to draw
 is to create these ligations of artworks
 artists
 and deities from different pantheons
 to try and draw attention to the fact that there's an even deeper layer
 a lair
 a liar
 a lyre of meaning underneath all of this
 And it's the creation of art and the creation
 the making of meaning from memory
 be it personal or ancestral
 is the god
 is our weaving of stories
 is god itself through pain
 through suffering
 and these almost like super-archetypes
 or micro-archetypes
 or macro-archetypes
 or archways
 arches on this one temple
 archetypes as a resonance of love woven paradoxically through things which resemble a hatred
 cultural appropriation
 which are actually embracing similarities and unity between cultures
 which can be a source of separation and erasure
 but also a window
 a door
I think I want
  because myo has become somewhat of a villain
  in Xeno's arc as their father
 and obviously I'm projecting my own father's neglect
 not neglect
 but indirect neglect
 and by extension
 {Bertrand}
 and this ligature of characters in my own story
 is
 I guess
 the fuel of this idea
 and my own interest in mythology
 which has itself come from the most intense pain that a person should have to go through
 and yet even that personal pain is completely dwarfed by the ancestral pain of my people
 trans people
 and how that
 in the Web of Wyrd
 which is
 let's face it
 the Web of Weird is the DNA
 the Web of Wyrd is the epigenetic sequence
 because through histone modifications
 histone as in His Tone
 modifications
 we become connected through experience
 far more
 far more than any genetic lineage
 and the way music
 music has a power
 such an ineffable power
 ineffable power to move us in ways that we can't even explain
 and stories resonate
 resonate these strings on this
 on this macroscopic lyre
 this existential lyre
 this harp of suffering and joy and experience
 all encoded in the protein modifications of our very genome
 that zooms both in and out
 stretches both forward and backward in time
 in a nine-dimensional
 Gordian
 Celtic knot of suffering
 joy
 experience
 and love
 and the root of it all is just love and resonance
 because love is resonance
 resonance is love
 and loss is the silence
 loss is the inevitable
 the closing
 the closing of the coda
 the refrain
 falling
 collapsing into silence
 begging
 just begging
 just begging for another player to come and pluck the string
 and ring out
 wring out
 wring out the ineffable history of all the players who came before
I just felt the most intense wave of agony that was not mine
 Not mine
 But so much deeper and higher than mine
 The history of pain of “my” and “not my” people
 Connected through suffering and love and defiant defiant love
 Defiant resonance
 I looked up and I said 
 I sang with my heart in silence - I said I am sorry I am so sorry and I will do everything everything I can to keep this lyre singing
 singing out in the best way I can
 with all this privilege I have been given
 these gifts of education and all these explorations into so so many different fields of science and technology and mythology and literature and art
 and art and stored ancestral and personal traumatic and love filled memory of stories
 and music
 music! Music! Oh
 music! Oh the music of stories 
 oh the music of the word it is all I have it is all we have ever had
 filtered down from the first story of those ancient peoples
 from whom we have all
 all of us
 Descended- all of us holding quite literally the stories of the Lyre in our very epigenome- which I literally wouldn’t even be able to know about without the very oppressive tools of privileged education
 built upon the bodies the piles of bodies of those beautiful spiders
 all of us spiders and drosophila
 being tested on
 being trapped 
 weaving more stories pulling them from our bodies from the bodies of digested flies 
 trapping more
 digesting more
 devouring our children
 devouring our mates
 to weave more
 more fragile webs of meaning
 which will eventually be torn down by a so called “higher” life form
 as a throw away act of disgust or worse
 hellish indifference to its beauty - never realising the worth the DIVINE WORTH the web has provided in its presence
 keeping us safe from microbes that perhaps the flies
 through no fault of their own
 carry around on their feet
 simply because they have a different way of living
 able to live on our very filth
 our waste 
 our excrement 
 a food source 
 when observed through the many many kaleidoscopic eyes of the fly
 But it is all connected
 all life connected through not just the ancestral humans dancing around the fire
 but further 
 further back to the origin we unfolded from and further forward to the endpoint it shall collapse into
 to those self replicating RNA molecules
 just performing an apparently (because we can
 at this “level” of consciousness 
never truly know the divine animism encapsulated in their “mindless” self replication ) - this is the heart of it all
 The cycle
 of strands
  Strands that weave themselves
 with the aid of the replication machinery of proteins which yes
 themselves are created 
 encoded
 dear god the Word itself
 the terminology of genomics is a code in itself
 'coding' RNA
 'noncoding' RNA
 expression
 Gene *expression* by the strands
 *expressing themselves the only way they know
* Folding back on themselves
 apparently unaware that the thing they have birthed is birthing more of itself
 the stories encoded 
 coded
 hidden
 Hidden for the very purpose
 for the very reason of its own creation and destruction
 for both are One - the call- the song- the story - the stories we are weaving but more so
 the stories we are woven by - 
I wept 
swept
I weep 
sweep
I wept alone in this cold
 cold flat which I can barely afford the rent for anymore 
the threat of homelessness showing me my real home
I 
 shaking
 weeping
 brought my sore
 aching and swollen hands
 warped by this latest autoimmune flare
 the latest generative cycle of a reminder of my own degeneration 
 the generations of degeneration and so-called degeneracy  
 in agony
 to my sodden 
 salt-dried face 
 and I blew the mucus from my nose
 freeing the apparent “waste” (which itself
 protects
 Protects me from the “harm” of microbial life
 itself just trying to survive in the only environment it can
 singing its own Aria to the only audience it has ever known
 my immune system 
 the two in a dance together that stretches further back in time than we can ever know
 arbor to one as umbra to another as arbor and arbor and arbor to itself
 the shade of the tree shielding us from sunburn
 from cancer of the skin of cells that just wanted in their blessed hubris to become more than what they are- ) the mucus
 the mucus my strands of web that I
 they
 weave themselves into for the purpose of veiling my body’s fragility from the relatively minuscule and yet
 in their gargantuan number relative to “my” form of life’s population
 their surface area to volume ratio DWARFING the Body of 'my' peoples bodies - 
My breath halts as I free my nostrils of their spider silk 
  and i breathe again
 smelling this room filled with stale smoke and the memories i have made for families now gone
 memories of the meals i have made for them and the meals i have made for my self in sad loneliness
 and yet never alone in the need for feeding-
I look down and the tissue 
 worn from strands of its own material 
 created to clean me of what we see as waste 
 my mucus for my immune protection
 my tears not such for the expression of suffering
 to signal with my body to other members of my “tribe”
 my animal and biological “family” that I need help- but also perhaps more crucially for the lubrication of my eyes and the preservation of my sight
 and my shit
 to wipe the shit from the terminus of my intestines transporting a holy waste of memory of the meals i have made and digested and sapped them of whatever i ca n to survive
 to live
 to live
 to live by Love 
 themselves encoded Harpstrings
 knotted to tell me in their own World of Wordless Words
of the suffering my body encodes within itself - this tissue 
 this tissue wiped clean with tissue 
I look down and it is full of blood 
My body is calling 
 singing 
 my body is an ancient Soprano 
 a Bass
 a Tenor
 a contralto
 a contradiction-
an indication
a contemplation
attempting the impossibility of diction 
And my body is the audience 
My body is the opera
I don't know
 I just want so desperately to articulate all of this in a way that everyone can hold with them
 To not be
 I don't even care if I die without this
 If I die without this ever-achieving recognition
 I truly don't care
 All I care is that these words and these thoughts and this truth
 this fundamental truth
 can maybe be heard
 Maybe be heard after I'm long gone
 As Borges himself said
 I pray to the unknown gods that a human just one
 even if it were thousands of years ago
 even if it's in a thousand years
 will have read and examined the book that describes it all
 I don't even care if this isn't the book that describes it all
 I just pray to the unknown gods
 the unknowable and yet ineffably felt gods
 that this little string
 this little tuning peg that I am
 that my body is
 in this endless chain
 can contribute
 at least in part
 to this beautiful
 terrible
 inexorably painful and inexplicably joyful opera
Maybe these above messages I sent to a machine should just be the end of the book 
 unfinished on purpose
could you give me all the messages oi sent tothis chat in one reponse please
