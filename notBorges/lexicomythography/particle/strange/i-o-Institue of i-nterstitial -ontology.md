**VII
				** **Layer i|o:**  musicologist “⧖” (Once Perigee, now ⧖eno, Interse⧖, S&M's child) develops Gordian Knotation utilising their corneal implant surgically installed by their father at the age of Seventeen (star tie in), a 23-pitch microtonal scale when applying the Endivean (Compiled in Superpositional Boustrophedon, devised by Myo's 'FFFs' i.e. Fast Forward Frames, 'quantum Noise trails' that stretch out of his body, showing every possible outcome of a decision but not the e⧖act one that will occur) algorithm to data recorded in musical staves (The First e⧖ample of Boustrophilology, but done with Musical staves) by medieval calligrapher Hilda Wiltergarten. She has lost her right hand and is likening the EDO split of the octave to her work in elitist world of her career in concert hall conducting /concert pianist , applying for a grant to produce a podcast series on “queering Mahler” which is written as 9 episodes never mentioning the 10th unfinished symphony, but embedded with a cipher (unbeknownst to even the grant body) that reveals the whole thing to be an analysis of only the tenth, with a secret attempt at “finishing” it. Chapter structure takes CYOA format with two paths (left and Right) converging on a central pillar of a performance in a Surgical Observation Theatre (written in jarring, confrontational moments of second person that implicate the reader, you, as Voyeur). The performance uses VHS tape loops that are constantly being written over with more and more CCTV footage of the audience, and although ⧖ knows (from a rehearsal that resulted in the 'in-creasing' of their hand) that their body will dissolve, with the in-creasing  effect accelerated by the mis en abyme of observers, they decide the message is more important than the medium, and go Willingly to their physical death; not realising that the implant that encases their eye in circuitry will render her form as a single eye, not allowing full transport to (wherever it is that in-creased forms go to i.e.) to become a Book in th eEndless Library (home of the Nine) The Realm of 'What For?'s - So they are stuck forever, half in the The 'What' of Real Forms (i.e. their eye, at first rolling around the floor of the operating theatre {the audience, racked with guilt, flee the scene (which is an underground performance delivered mostly to ⧖'s e⧖-orchestra members, perhaps a neglectful and almost abusive 'polymathecule' who don't actually care about them, just use them in order to feel 'special' with ⧖'s connection to Myo Endive's legacy) yet too cowardly to tell the authorities, so the eye is left there for months until somebody (The Entoetymologist, Prof Ed. O.) notices strange ecological patterns; swarms of drosophila flying in 'murmurations' and guiding the prof to the observation theatre, finding a sisyphean scene: the flies are pushing the eye up the gurney slope of the theatre, trying to get it out to show people what has happened, but they aren't strong enough / some of them, through instinct and against their judgement (as it takes chunks out of the sphere and makes the eye less able to be rolled) have been nibbling the eye, absorbing the Gnoetic Essence of ⧖eno} the eye is eventually preserved in Myo Endive's museum in the 'human' world) in the reflections of Uncrossable Door of the library; where Selena and Myon go every day to try to talk to them, they do not ever talk back, resenting their Father for causing such a hellishly infinite and split e⧖istence, the only being to ever be split across the two Realms.
