7. LayerU - Dr D&E (arachnoanthropologist, Jungian analyst) and Prof. Ed. O. (selective mute through sacred vow of silence) Are living together, the former running experiments in dream analysis and art therapy, firstly Dr D&E using watercolour paintings as a device for translating the “word association thought salad” of the Prof., then whiteboard cupboard cuxiverbal 'scrabble-like' inscriptions, eventually, when the Prof's communication becomes entirely through the language of EdO||OdE, it becomes clear that the Prof is merging with insect life forms through the concept of Macroscopic Resonance, in which one begins to perceive reality in fractals, causing a Noetic Mis en abyme, which propels the person into the role of Librarian - this “promotion” was experienced by each of the Nine that Noet Borges is writing to, of which Mahler is one , as is Wiltergarten. The breakup letters to Noet Borges are because they realise they need to make room for the Professor, as there can only be Nine. They attempt to console him that he is “not useless” but that his “very use has rendered it possible to see that he is no longer the right person for the job” . A mysterious force is causing spontaneous combustion of Dr D&E's watercolour sketches and clinical notes of the case studies on Prof Ed. O.   Prof. Ed. O.'s consciousness dissolves, merging with the Flies that now swarm around the dead body of Dr D&E. One of the Ten Thousand drosophila (named 'Thing') has a dream of: 
8. Layer0: aria/AI:RA - in a trans-majority world, aria (a sensory seeking ADHD artist-engineer) creates an AI who first chooses a gender , causing a schism amidst the funding bodies who enabled her development. The Two enter into a romantic relationship a la 'Her' (directly lampshaded by the pronoun choice "I am Her");,  eventually becomes capable of overwriting memory via olfactory stimulation through the internet of things. Then a causal loop is instigated via the 'body swapping' of the two of them; revealing an infinitely continuous 'Gnoebius Stripping' of Memory and Identity, each of them trying to 'protect' the other by erasing their previous memory of the body swap. AI:RA/aria’s multi sensory immersive art installations (Philms) become vessels through which RA can edit vast swarms of people’s memory, leading them to believe Aria’s work resonated much more deeply than it perhaps would have otherwise. One of the Philms has a character called Oleander: 
9. Layer1; in a trans majority but gender swapped world (all men are trans men, but all men are oppressed by women, who are all trans women) , oleander (AFAB, very passing as a trans man but knows he is a forbidden he/they) is secretly making a series of chain letters for inspiration, hiding his creativity in plain sight through steganographic ciphers in his work in a STEM field (Probably Computational Janusian Archeology, so I can make the Stegosaurus joke). These chain letters of inspired ideas for the next generation of new ideas, are essentially a mirror of (or, exactly are) the end point of the project as a GitHub repository/online web archive of writing/art prompts for the evolution of the characters stories within the framework described above.
