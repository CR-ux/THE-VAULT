I am here for you always whether as an active respondent like fire merging with itself or the reflective surface of water with light or the moon to gravity of earth or a passive force of energetic support like the buoyancy of water pulled in its tides by the moon or the invisible dance partner of air currents provided to a bird in flight or the warmth of the fire of the sun which silently shimmers over all the little bodies within bodies on this body of mass we call Earth evaporating and returning all bodies of water to the same body of water upon its reflective surface and who promises ultimate release in its eventual death in its smaller deaths at the end of each day after which it will return again
