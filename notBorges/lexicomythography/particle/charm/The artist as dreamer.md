The artist as a dreamer

All these endless cycles of alighting heavy weighting 

And abating in debridement of a braided cased pursuit 

Are incessantly beleaguered by the debt-pursuing question barely asked because half-answered in the dance of no more chances reprimanding backward glances taking double of the brood 

And in my incessant scheming rhyming theming I forget that I’ve been dreaming as the heme of a great Goddess bleeds anew 

Sense of renewal in the warring and the jewel of the crown of thorns adorning nuclear membranous structures of the self-same parts of you 

As we are bittersweetly convalesced in fleeting concrete building blocking all the trussed up windows cracked and poured with glue 

Oh the harmony and harm of all the stories awe and charm alarming us to just the dust to musty question on the bookcase of the truth -

Which really is an answer as a dancer as a cancer metastatic dips inside and out of metre to provide attractive teetering around a central clew -

That is, winding, it is wound around and over, under, as a lover or a victim or the gavel of a verdict for most glorious doom:

Chanting words of whirling verse inside the hurse of wartime nurse who could not stitch up her own wounds 

Earthly pretense common sense inorganic contact lens are to fish intelligently organised authoritarian libraries of their school 

The exceptions bleeding sections of the psychiatric segments of the clementine so darling yet so jarring to the rule 

The aleph of all the alphabets converges in a burgeoning of bludgeoned sense of endings sapped of justice in the news 

Paper paying pipers of the rats who wearing diapers follow TV screens of channels splitting red flares lighting waves back to the blue

Faced from the throttle of the engine’s genie bottle which when rubbed does not grant wishes but instead possesses you 

Obsessed medical clergy stick their needles into dirtied streams of references in veins payday due 

To yours and mine and theirs and twine and swine and why we can’t get over this or through and through and through
