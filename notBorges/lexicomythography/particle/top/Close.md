Hear, lay our Ædrian.

On The Twenty Third Day, 
Of The Twelfth Month, 
Of Twenty Twenty Three 

They {singular|plural} were inside a Bibliogorætian Bothy, a small shack of infinitely strong, anciently fragile wood, being licked by the Yellow Labrador {metaphorical|literal} of the winter cold. The Bothy was standard, as all the others, spaced out across the Tundra just beyond the Moat surrounding the Endless Library of Labels throughout dimensions unknowable to give the collective appearance, or Simulcra, of each individual Bothy, or Simulcrum, being entirely alone in the Forested dark.

Or at least, this is what they {plural|singular} had envisaged.

Beneath the Three of them {singular} promised the rich, dense mulch of years upon years across every recorded syllable of time recorded in rot, and the woodlouse scratchings of human bone; where even in the depths of silence, still crawled the perspicacious pitter-patter of infinitely intelligent, industrious insects, who themselves crawled lusciously, illustriously, with the Pater-pitta of microscopic microbes - themselves filled with the crumbling chickpeas of the {apparently, or so they thought} thoughtless, instinct-cycle bound, building blocks of all existence. They wound genetic material like wool around the spools of pools of proteins, Histones, making stories from four letters {just four letters, A, T, C, G} forming words now untranslatable in their meaning, but embedded impossibly and inextricably into the ever-eroding, yet entirely solid geoformation of collective meaning, like infinite swords in His Stone walled library. These memories, their self-attributed meanings, forming a peculiar song with a infinite microtones, misattributed by many as falling into the genre of "Noise music" {whatever that means}.These infinite microtones, themselves infinitely divisible and, inexplicably, without defining boundaries between them, when Heard from macro-, or identically {but oppositely}, microcosmic Ear, can be herded as a Single Tone. Histone. 


Above what was Beneath the Three of them {plural}, like a rolled out futon for a surprise guest; perhaps a dearly beloved friend who's infinitely smiling Light you often find yourself carried into daydreams about, whose grave you didn't manage to make the groups memorial visit to, on the anniversary of their death, due to your jaw being surgically bolted shut, and your face swollen Yellow into the facade of a desert; but still below them, lay the foundation of their story. Breeze blocks {which allowed that great Family dog of the Wind {to howl through and huff and puff without blowing the Bothy down|eventually, to crawl within, to die there, so as not to leave The Burden of its alighted Body's Weight in the Family Home- but rather, to face the Endless Night Alone, All One. One final tail-wag of affection, Elected Solitude as a Sign of Innocent and Selfless Love}} were tessellated neatly, much like the building blocks left unattended by Flow, Ædrian's little one. 

As was customary here, Each parent, upon choosing the name for their child, must first choose a Name of appropriate Resonance, and then flip the name backwards for its recording on all official documents in the Endless Library of Labels. This, as you of course know, and as half of you reading will have been directly affected by, which means the other half reading have been equally, though differently so, led to an interesting distribution of what we came to call or have always called 'sense' and 'antiSense' nomenclature amidst the inhabitants of the Bothies. It also meant that initialisation of Names {though this was never really necessary, as inhabitants very rarely left their own countably infinite back gardens}[^Fork] for the so-called *Sentia* generations was made from right-to-left {or 3'-> 5'} direction, with the final letter of their Name{s} acting as the complement to their *antiSentia* parental {and progenitor} eponyms. 

In typifying fashion, N, a fountain of expression, Meaning-deluged, wordy witchcrafting, had devised a name for their child that had two {perhaps, definitely} dimensional meaning, whether transcribed in the 3'->5', 5'->3', or other modality. Flow Oeb {surname redacted}, or {redacted surname} Beo Wolf, or simply 'Flo', or 'B', unfurled a veritable cast of characters from its unassumingly palindromic Seven letters, or characters. 

Just Under their Bodies {that is, gently pressed by the weight of these Three's formlessnesses, Works of Form, and Form of works} lay the splintering wood of the Bothy floor. Flo {they had seemed to lean more towards this directionality of their name as their system of meaning-making memory self-replicated} had taken to memorising which floorboards creaked and in what mode, devising 'scales' through the different forking paths of the shack, their humble, yet infinitely divisible, home. And so therein began a game between the two {or Three, but mostly just One, as Flow was the only one with enough of a grasp on Gordian Chant Theory} of them, whereby Flow would giggle-ously stop N at the door from the small mezzanine bed they had recently awoken from, and announce something along the lines of 'Phrygian!' or 'Lydian!', watching in glee, as Dante, Flo's Golden Light, a Labrador, watched Flo in turn, licking their joyful face, as N would attempt, at the scale they could, to 'play' the floorboards in the appropriate *Ambitus*[^range] - quite, for N at least, an ambitious task. 

In the enclosure of their little house of wood, in the Woods of what Would and could never be wood-be Trees, one of these mornings {where the now-filled Red pale of water mourned the nightly passing of the Moon, and all the pull She had upon its little offering of water}, Flo was yet unaware of the Grayness of the day that laid behind where they were lying, just past the membrane of the velvet blackout curtain they'd woven as One, the possibilities of their time together stretching out in spirals, as spires like hypodermic needles, scratching into the muscle of the clouds, before them. 

'Dorian!' was today's exclamation, delivered gleefully, from the usual mezzanine pulpit built from Tree Bark, to a different, yet just as sturdy, percussive bark from Dante -

Sometimes, having just returned from the Lean-to, where N perhaps had always been going {to|fro(m)}, where they chopped the wood for their {{Heart}h} daily, oftentimes not for the purposes of producing more kindling, but rather, as a contemplative practice, enthralled and rapt, swaddled by the sound of the axe; against the crack; against the absolutely cracking resonance; amidst all; the all-encompassing trees; as a wave of Sound travels through the air; like an adventurer-- delic{ate|ious}. 

Deliciously {wast|squander}ing all their years; 
searching for a single Book-- which might tran{slate|scribe} all the others.

Allowing them to crumble

promised into Being, by that first sound, 
of the axe's {or, equally, the {wood's|Woods'}} *crack*, 
the {k}not-yet-known, but felt, because, not looked for, sound-- 
of the self-same {though, now {divided|halved||halved} again} fractal

Always, due to both necessity and proximity {ever-near was the Well}, would they bring a Red pale of water back to the cabin, the bucket never losing its beautiful shine, Dante's source of water, but remaining the visage of a fire hydrant, sitting next to the contained, yet uncontainable element of Fire, within that wrought iron Hearth they gathered around, as if the unassuming, supposedly inanimate vessel's very appearance held dualistic and equally necessary meanings: impending {nourishment | restriction} from threat. 

N. had just finished writing a story for Flow, and besides the one, constant watchful eye they kept open while sleeping, which still, as ever, peered itself {metaphorically} upon the summoning stone-circle of those little bricks that brought Flow so much joy, whose joy in turn brought this small nest of a Family's Dog so much joy. Never wanting to restrict their creativity, N could never place the bricks back in the ever-empty box for bricks {which resembled {unintentionally but not accidentally} identically, the structure of the lean-to} for fear of rearranging some structure of a plan for a yet-to-be structure that Flow may have been, consciously or not, in the process of taking shape by their finger's spidery and shimmering murmurations. At the same time, being, ineffably, a Parent, they were ever-all-too-aware of the potential of a choking hazard, for both their child, and the beloved Familiar which Flo had so competently assumed their own parentage of. that is to say, this lovely fixture of innocence in the corner of their cabin had become a simultaneous reminder of dualistic and equally necessary meanings: impending cognitive {nourishment | restriction} from threat.

By the nature of their apparent difference in Form, the duty of chopping wood, and indeed carrying water {or rather, carrying the carrying of water which was the duty of the Red pale} fell to N. Because of their {plural, Flo and Ædrian's} respective sensory sensitivities {and|or} appetites {respectively} the latter's wood-chopping was never observed directly by the former. Never seen, only heard was that thunderous, splendiferous 'crack'. 

What N didn't know {or, perhaps, did}, but Flo did {or, rather, didn't} was that the uncanny resemblance of the lean-to and the brick box was not just resemblance of meaning in memory, but, meaningfully, in actuality {whatever that means}. They were one and the same, but only through the act of interaction. This meant with every chop of the axe, and only with the Will of the axe's chopping, were the branches of causality in our, 'real' world, or, within The 'What?' of 'Real' Forms. 

Unnoticed or noticed but taken for granted by the Two of them, or Three of them, was the multiplication of bricks in the box, corresponding exactly to the dwindling of the kindling in the lean-to. And, in complementarity, as logs were brought into the lean-to, bricks would disappear in equal numbers from the box.

With every axe-crack {and only then}, or every brick ligation {and only then}, would the bridge between these two seemingly unconnected objects in temporal space be revealed in phenomenological space. As N. often made their water-carrying, wood-chopping excursions in the death of night {pre- morning floorboard game}, or in the early dawn {pre- morning floorboard game}, the two would never be performing their respective actions simultaneously. Rather, the two {or, as I've said, Three}, would be locked in an inevitable dance of action {*wei*} and 'absence of action' {*wu*} by virtue of forces unknown, but deeply felt, to them {*wu wei*}. As the wind is not seen, but rather the effect it leaves, upon the leaves; as a lost lover is not seen, but rather their effect, in their leaving, is both seen and felt; and the wind, as the lover that it is, moves about, within, and perhaps even outside of the space it occupies, it makes new space of its own, between the leaves, in thE--

*-xcuse me, a pigeon just flew into my window, I had to run to check if she was okay, she left a stain upon the unforgiving glass, a trickery of transparency; I wonder if she was trying to get in, to tell me something; or if she was simply going about her business; I wonder if perhaps the message she was trying to carry is embedded in the cipher of the stain; It bears the illustration of a dandelion clock, waiting in anticipation for the Breath of a Parent who is a child-- 

As eye was saying, or rather, as I was writing, or indeed as you were reading and I wasn't writing, as a pigeon had flown through the veil of my story into the world we call 'Real', forcing my head to jolt to the right, and my eyes to read a symbol that was or was not written by the Pigeon's leaving body, whether leaving this world as a result of the impact or simply leaving from my field of view {as I suppose, in a solipsistic sense, these are one and the same}, what was it I was saying? In the silent sense of the word "saying", I mean to say, by writing, and I hope you reader read it as such, but either way, perhaps my writing that you are reading is being "said", in a way, by yourself, through the vessel of my "voice", again, in the silent, creative sense of the word "voice", an attempt to creatively convey the idea that the Word, or one's "voice" has both an immanent and transcendent quality, or character, to it, no matter the character of the character reading the characters written in the form of a letter to the reader. 

-N. was distractedly in the midst of t{he{i|s}r} latest attempt to reproduce the labyrinthine musical sequence {that had, so many times, so effortlessly flown from} Flo {Or, Board game} had assigned as the 'Dorian' path, from her picturesque, attic's eye view, young forever. With each 'incorrect' 'note' they 'played' with the padding of their careful footsteps, Flo would {rather sadistically, like a ray of Sun upon a wanderer in a desert} shriek a high pitched "No!" - it was only today, for some reason, N. had realised the homophonic nature of the words "No" and "Know"; and this realisation seemed to set something into motion, as if the act of negation gave birth to propagation. N. wondered, between steps, between tones even, in the microtonal space of timeless singularity, for an uncountable moment, if perhaps they should include this 'propagation-by-negation' theme in their story for Flo, before another 'No' from above, provided a facsimile of the Divine Voice, as if t{w}o say "No, N, no more revisions, no more additions, the balance comes from you reading what you have written, to your child, and together, the two of you creating meaning, in an iteration of interaction". 

This 'Divine Voice' or rather, was and is of course, their own voice, removed from the tethers that kept her seeing the bricks as a suffocation device, or indeed the Pale as a protective shield, or indeed the bricks as a creative tool, or indeed still the Pale as a crucible for nourishment of their bodies. 

So, the greyness of the day passed, as it always must, the Two, soon to be Three, going about their business {or non-business}, until the moment arrived, a single yawn from Flo signalling it was time for The Bedtime Story. 


"Before the trip to the Library" they began, Flo's hypersensitive hearing seeming to emit a sound of its own, an axe-crack of excitement or the sound of two plastic bricks clicking together. "I have another story for you"

Flo performed their usual stimming ritual, clapping but not clapping, rather knocking the bones of their hands together with their fingers outstretched and overextended, forming an X with each impact. Every time N. had the sheer joy {and it really was the sheerest joy they had ever, and would ever, feel} of observing their child's sheer joy in its all-embodied, primal state. Simply expressing, involuntarily, the sentiment "I have been moved to move", or, more movingly: "You have moved me to move".

This *mis en abyme* of movement, beginning with the very seed of Love that had birthed them, through all the burning blocks of wood and all the melted bricks of plastic, was the spark that wrote their {singular} stories {plural}. It was, and is, also the same spark that the very first humans {plural} danced around and hit their own bones {perhaps in the form of instruments constructed of animal bone, perhaps, like Flo, in a beautiful manifestation of the glimmering hope of neurodivergent Being}. It was, and is, and always will be, the spark that moves the fingers writing this story. Swollen-jointed and succumbing to a most-likely auto-immune flare, I think about this restriction, this pain, and this limitation, and about all the 'limitations' placed upon all thinkers of this Library of Libraries. I think about a quote by my favourite author, The Once One of Nine ex-Noet Borges, which goes something like:

"*Limitation to the art brings liberation to the artist*"

And, as always, His Divine Voice offers a semblance of silent soothing in the noise of pain running through my physical body. The difference between 'disability' and 'ability' is the difference between a Framework and a Cage. It is also three letters "Dis", which is the currently adopted name of the previously-worshipped, perhaps first, God of the Gauls, *Dis*. Later through a transcriptional, translational process called "*interpretatio romana*" Caesar asserted that "All Gauls claimed descent from Dis Pater" - which actually means that the Gauls all claimed to be descendents of a God which *he equated* {likely, in a resonant, though insufficient comparison} with the Roman Dis Pater. 

History is not only written by the victors, it is written by the Meaning that the victors ascribed to the Memories of their victories {the memories themselves unreliable, self-mutating machines of meaning-making}, and, more importantly, perhaps most importantly, history is written by the Meaning that the victors ascribe to the Memory of the those they have been "victorious" against. This likely explains, in his incessant thirst for dominance, why the 'Father' God of fertility, the Earth's natural abundance, which he saw as a request for its own dendritic epilation, ripping out trees {like hairs from a leg attached to a body | attached to oppressive standards | expecting romantic company | assumed {whether accurately or not} to themselves expect to uncover a smoothness of skin under the roughness of its veil}, and in the emptinesses left behind, paving with long, straight roads, laid with cement like moisturiser cream upon the absent echoes of hair follicles too soon; bound to cause a breakout eventually.

But moving forward, back to the Bothy, where N was being moved, by the movement Flo was moved into, by N's own metaphorical movement, to a promised point in time that held a new narrative movement still - 

Still, N. inhaled, and the projection of the document onto the ceiling just above the mezzanine bed faded into being, through the movement of not her form, but the movement of t{he{i}}r Will, which as we know is the only real movement there is. Flo shrieked again, this time at a lower register {only they would be able to accurately state which pitch or perhaps mode this note fell within, which is to say, they wouldn't be able to, because they had a depth of understanding far beyond what I could possibly tran{s|literate|scribe|late|pose} onto this Two dimensional box of word-bricks you are currently reading; but they likely would have answered something that suggested every pitch contains all the others}. 

They flopped backward, away from N., but very much so toward them {plural}, toward the story they {singular {plural {triplicate {singular}}}} had written, purely out of Love, and the Will, the crackling Hearth of Will, that was birthed from Love Observed, or rather Love Observing Itself, and the Love of the Will that was birthed from the Infinitely Reflected Observation of Love - 

And Flo was a mirror 
And N. was a mirror looking upon them {plural} as they {singular} ascended the ladder to the mezzanine snug-as-a-bug-in-a-house-made-of-wood-and-warmed-by-the-same-wood-burning-in-a-fire-in-a-box-not-for-restriction-or-protection-but-to-offer-a-little-warm-soft-light-and-sound-in-this-cold-dark-silence, as a mirror 
And, reaching the top of the ascent, an adventurer, ready to read the adventures they had mapped out for their wee bairn in their wee barn in this endless {though crucially, not infinite} expanse of Bothies just like {but crucially, not the same as} theirs, making adventurers of them {plural} both {singular}, they used one of {which one is not important, but it's important I mention its unimportance} their hands to 'swipe' the display of the document, which they had designed to appear as what The Librarians might call a 'book' to its initial page; enshrouding them both in that timeless, unutterable feeling, that seemed to whisper, silently, inquiring, gently out of genuine concern, as a Mother, of all Mothers, to the child, of the child of us: 
	*"are you sitting comfortably?" -*

And the roll-out futon was a mirror -
And the ceiling was a mirror -
And the two of them, lying next to One Another, were mirrors
And the mirrors were, far from abominable but rather, abysmal, not in its commonly-used, {and therefore} warped sense, but in its lesser-trodden, ever-downtrodden shadow sense; by which I mean its realest sense, in that, it points to where the Truth of Light can be found: abysmal, as in, boundless. Abysmal, as in, bottomlessness. Abysmal, as in, the ocean of all potential, which holds the privilege of an amnesty from Gravity as we know it, which it begets to us with each of our own submerging in its unknowable womb; where our Two {and very almost soon to be Three} characters were lying, not sitting, but still, ineffably content, and yes, very comfortably. 

N, I shall begin, 
had unveiled the title of their latest offering of Love, which the ceiling now reflected back and into the parent and child, who in their holding one another, somehow swapped places, and in the swapping, became a Third, smaller, yet infinitely greater thing. 

They became the memory of that moment, of the beginning of this Story. 
They became the infinitely expanding and breathing meanings that each of them ascribed to the memory of that moment of the beginning of this Story. 
And they became the Story, which, as N. was about to read to Flo, was titled:


*"We Are 
N{Ever}
Going On A Bear Hunt, 
Ever A-"*

-Gained momentum of waiting in anticipation brought to a halt; ripped as the futon out from under them, and replaced with a weightlessness; a pigeon, the pigeon, flies into their bothy window {as {if t{w}o say}|with the crash of} a symbol- interrupting the beginning of the Story, with an ending of its own.

But the many who never tried assumed {perhaps erroneously} that those who {definitely} crossed the boundary of their back garden were not permitted, allowed, or able to return {to where they'd started, as if for the first time}.
