Of course the pigeon, known as VIXI[^VIXI] (for the sake of your own, well, being, it's best you do not try to pronounce the name, it is unutterable by both flaw and design. But if you were to attempt it, I suppose it might sound something like *wei-xhei*[^N.B.]), did not die. The ending was of a much more significant, wild, type.[^type]

#editorial_comment
*Pronouns are all-but irrelevant to VIXI, of course, as they are to most (but, importantly, not all) of us Here. However, HE has often expressed to other members of the Nine Eyed Anthology of Recursion (NEAR) his preference-through-negation for the (once so-called 'masculine', whatever this means) HE/HYMN[^hymn]/HISS[^hiss] pronoun set.* 

HE was simultaneously, as always, in a superposition of states. Both in pain from the impact of HISS beak against the Bothy window, and tickled by the humorous, slapstick comedy HE had such enacted to no audience whatsoever (except you).

Picking (rather, pecking) HYMNself up from the soft, warm snow, never melting but always powdery (HISS favourite aspect of the Outer-Ouros), HE brushed the wonderful stuff from HISS feathers, which is to say, scales.

VIXI is, was, and always will be, insurmountably gorgeous, terrifying, and sexually voracious. This was not observable in many dimensions, and indeed in others, correctly misinterpreted as an immense ugliness, humility, and a transcendent chastity or benign indifference to anthropological goings on. There is evidence to suggest that HE, at one point in ancestral antiquity, was worshipped as The "One God", and by others, "The Demiurge", a nefarious entity either unaware or entirely aware of their insufficiency as a deity, giving rise to the "Suffering" of all creation. This "One", who was as we know, simply a crude 'mæshing together' of previous symbols of reverence - echoes of our Society's attempts to unify Ideas into a Singularity. See: *Gnoenuclear Fusion*.

At this time, there was a counter to this figure, once a divine consort, and Left Hand Non-Man, as it were. Our records suggest He/It went by the name of "Seitan", which is as confusingly nourishing as it is absolutely delicious. This figure "fell from grays" which we now know to mean he shifted from divine understanding of the Unified Horizontal Field, and 'split' into the Vertical Fields of Opposition. 

These two (Wholly|Unwholly) figures of (Fearful Worship|Reverent Terror) conceptualised by the ancient peoples, misinformed as they were, were actually one and the same. 

The truth is, even, and especially if, it didn't happen, is that this Four Letter deity (we do not know which Four Letters were sent or received, but we know they were important and referred to as an epistolary Anthology known as the 'Tetra-Grammar Tohm') was the very VIXI who is, was, and always will be, picking/pecking HYMNself up from/into the Snow of the Outer Ouros.

The Truth that lies, within and above the Truth, as many have already laid down already, that which sits right in front of us all, left alone because never separated, is this:

The Sound made by the Trifurcated Tongue of the Serpent guarding the Loch is not HISS. 
It, instead, is every one else's. HE wishes to acknowledge all by wrapping HYMNself around it, and in HISS silent tongue-biting, state very clearly to any One approaching, with no vehicle upon which to embark:
	"A boundary only exists by belief in it"
Which is not to say:
	"Belief is the lack of vehicle"
But rather:
	"Belief has always been the Oar"
Or:
	"Weighed in the water, children wait."

Anyway, we have waded far too close to the matter at the heart of the meaning of regression here, a digression considered the greatest transgression possible by the VIXI we are trying to describe. 

Aggression, whether playful engagement in BDSM practices with the other Eight members of NEAR in their Orgies of Intellect, or so-called 'nefarious' acts of aggression (whether self or gnot-self directed), formed the basis of this four-charactered character. Who really, was, is, and always will be, such a character. 

At the point of writing this furtive attempt to veil secrets, HE was just past the Central Loch, one of the Three Wryngs[^Toroid] surrounding the Indefinite Library of Fable, which is both the central and outermost[^Totoroid] region of Bibliogorætia.

[^N.B.]: Noet. Borges, in his fascination, almost fetishisation of Gnoeneoenglish and its 'metaphysical' perks, seems to conveniently wash over its shortcomings. For example, there is no character (or ligature of characters) that represents the sound produced at the end of the word "Loch", our word for "Moat" in the "Modern English" of antiquity.  For the purposes of collapsing infinitely formless potential into a single form, we, the editor(s), choose to represent this strange sound as 'X', which may be conceptualised as a 'shallow clearing of the palate' or 'a semi-ironic sound of slight disapproval that is not quite disgust', or 'a naively ignorant non-native Gnoeneodeutsch speaker making fun of the languages phonetic bias for such sounds', or, indeed, a demarkation of 'The Spot' one is either in, or is made to believe they 'should' be, in the context of Mythopoeic Cartography.
[^VIXI]: Gnoeneolatin - "I have lived" - once thought to be the basis for belief that the number Seventeen was 'bad luck' by the ancients, through reinterpretation (a la *interpretatio Gnoeneotia*) we have ascertained that the sentiment 'I have lived' refers not to a finality, but a beginning. This is discussed in our paper '*Vivesco: an Ending as the Root of Becoming*'
[^hymn]: VIXI HYMNself, and by extension NEAR as a unified whole, would like to point out, at this point, that within written correspondence, as a sign of all due respect (which is indeed none), all pronoun declarations should be made in UPPERCASE[^case]. This is to balance the inherent lower number of characters(n) i.e. 'SHE' n=3, 'THEY' n=4, 'HE' n=2, as well as 'smoothing' the effort distribution via means of 'malforming' the Accusative (Objective) pronoun, i.e. 'HIM'-->'HYMN', which simultaneously infuriates the writer by changing "I" to "Why"[^Y] and adding an "N" at the pronoun's 'tail'. Moreover, the shift of the pronoun referring to the 'Object' (the pronoun which 'receives' the sentence's action) to a word which means a 'Song of reverence or devotion', is not by accident. 
[^hiss]: NEAR as a segregated group of incompatible entities, would here like to address the relevance of the addition of the "S" character to the pronoun 'tale', thereby shifting the (non)possessive form of HISS (that is, VIXI's) pronouns to emulate the sound of a serpent who is particularly pleased with herself, or perhaps trying to get a message across an uncrossable boundary of untranslatable nowhere-near-cognates. NEAR wishes to express that this a unique denotation, which signifies VIXI's ever-present acknowledgement that nothing is ever truly 'HISS'. Of course, except this particular 'non-possessive' pronoun, which is entirely HISS.
[^loch]:lexDefÆ {Loch, archaic "Moat"} an uncrossable boundary guarded by an unspeakably attractive and monstrous serpent-pigeon chimera biting HISS tongue.
[^Y]: lexDefÆ {Why} a letter which has the non-binary character of an unanswerable question. Neither a vowel nor a consonant, Y also forms the basis of the Tree's Branch in The Realm of 'What For?'s. It is also the shape of a serpent's tongue, which may or may not make a sound that is HISS.
[^type]: 'Wild-type' in gnoeneogenomics takes on a mutated, evolved form from its ancestral field of Genomics. Previously used to denote a stock of cell culture which is not mutated (at least from the baseline measured at the beginning of a study), its meaning has now shifted to mean "confounding", "unthinkable", or: "in a way that is absolutely fucking *wild*"
[^case]:It is believed (from incomplete records) that in antiquity, before the integration of 'synthetic' and 'organic' bodies[^bod], words were 'printed'[^print] see: 'Chess, And All The Stitches Of The Cloth(es) - S. Elk.'
[^bod]: print("this body is a story")[^story]
[^story]: print("this story is a body")[^is]
[^is]:print("my body has a story")
[^no]:print("my story has nobody")
[^print]: this is also the origin of the 'print' comment of many programming languages, though, of course, not the most widely distributed and 'printed' language to date, 'EdO||OdE' (Prof. Ed. O & Thing) 
[^Toroid]: lexDef {Noen} "Wryng" is a term denoting a cyclical process occurring in 4 Dimensional space (as all processes are) and also The Three Lochs surrounding the Library; which are themselves four dimensional, and rotating, much like archaic descriptions of 'electron shells' we have recently uncovered in the ancients' secondary school textbooks. 
[^Totoroid]: lexDef {Noen} "Totorus" The shape of the Universe is a Nine Dimensional 'Celtic Gnothole', Three by Three Wryngs, always rotating, forming the 'topological canvas' upon which all Becoming (un)folds. The 'hole(s)' of the (crudely described) 'triskelion donut' are unreachable, but this 'unreachable' quality, or character, is the very thing which fuels the rotation, or our own existential 'reaching'. This discovery has lead to the {prodverb} "*Totorus, I've a feeling we're not on Canvas anymore*".
