*Episode 23 of the Literary Critique podcast discussing The Woman In The Wallpaper's seminal Work, "Phage 23" {do knot, cite yore} source: an unreleased journal, "Red, Ring, Parallel," referenced in an art installation. **The journal entry** itself focuses on the book's content, and its controversial withdrawal. This Podcast was the first time the Work has been discussed publicly, and (following the outcry resulting from its release) was subsequently (within three seconds {of a {single drosophila('s)} dream}) removed from streaming platforms *


"Author X, in their book 'Phage 23' explored a deeply intricate and complicated exploration of an alternate universe in which a virus pandemic consumed the world's population with an alarming death toll, leaving one member of the population with a superhuman ability of hearing, but the book was recalled from shelves due to the immediate outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, in an event of sheer coincidence or of the very parapsychological abilities (though, precognitive, rather than auditory) the author herself was exploring in the work"
