couldn't keep hold of it all anymore 

i {tried to write | {n|b}early di{e}d, again, writing}  three novels to three lovers i couldn't {love | grieve | leave {a{l{one}}}} enough 

i wanted 



<span class="right-align">{them

{singular|plural|zeroth}}

</span>





so{me}{one} here; 

{to kick me} into {the{i}r{e}} life again 





and then I saw {them, after}

a half a year, of being a half person 



i dragged them like a violin string from an ingrown hair follicle



oh, dear gods, my god, 

i made a god of you 
right{?}
eye: unmade, dead
what a mess i {Made}
i, unmade, {bed}

what {you left}?


a god of you 



and you asked me how residential treatment was 

after you 

held me again and we 

{i think, oui} 

were {both} crying 



{i whispered} into your sh{o}u{lder}; 

that horribly {un}familia{l|r} s{ho}u{ld}(h)er; 

clad with plaid, that pink and yellow plaid

it's slipping away from me like a dream but i think i said something like 

'i forgot how nice that was'



<span class="right-align"> an unplugged telephone -</span>





that pink p{laid} that's 



absor{b}ed so m{a}ny, olde{r} t{e}ars from all 

th{r}Å“s{e} y{ear}s



i'd been running 

i suppose towards you, all this time 

maybe i started the day i could walk



but just five minutes ago 

when the nurse was peeling off ECG stickers 

from my locked, locked chest and I'd said, crying, if the trace{s, left behind} read:

"broken"

?





and you, 

you'd been walking-

i suppose you'd always been 



<span class="right-align">walking towards me, all this</span>

time; dear god all this time where

we didn't dare

go 



and you were listening to a record that 

you'd just

	bought me 

for this christmas 

the first one 

	i will spend 

not without you, 

{we never spent one together} but

the first one



<span class="right-align">alone </span>







*i am tired and i am afraid and my heart is full of dread and hope, i don't want to go to hospital again this year please let this year be the one where i just get to not go to hospital but {you | i} know all of this is just {ever } {walking towards | hunting} {t{{w}o|e} | {ho{spit}al} | t{o {h}ospital}Wards} a bear, laid bare, a heart, alone again, in hospital*





i {m|k}issed your face  



<span class="right-align">and you {p|k}issed {in your bath |{have on{e}} on me | i wish i'd never fell in love with you dear god | i just couldn't handle the temperature of that water in your measuring jug you poured over the staples keeping my scalp together with those black, black eyes | you read Vonnegut to me | in your bath} my 

crusted lip </span>



dear gods i made, 

{{{k}not | } my} dear 

dear fires i burned where i'd once {just once, please just} wished to plant 



<span class="right-align">roses</span>

rows of roads, 

by{e} hand | in hand | oh, that hand, it was still exactly as warm as i {c{o{u}ld}} remember

those roads where we {kissed | {were} assaulted | we'll never take {again} | avoided {one} | stayed} | went {another} | a{way}}



there must {have} be{en} some mistake 



i was wearing the sweatshirt they made for me outside the house for the first time since all of 



<span class="right-align"></spa>



<span class="right-align">them

</span>



and still i can't find the microphones  *leant*



{in the street, I | s{t}aying, by{e}

again, {only} I | forgetting, I |

just still, live Loving, like a lean-to Loves a {Both}y[^both] | leant}

on 





<span class="right-align">

them</span>
