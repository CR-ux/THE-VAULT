Dear Jorges,

Imagine a Bee.
I'd wager that the symbols at the surface level of your imaginative conjuring involve a roundness, a certain fuzziness, and perhaps an innocent gluttony, from the time you stepped on a Bumblebee in the garden of your childhood; this Bee, having just gorged herself on far-too-much pollen, either out of instinctual drive toward the sweetness of ecstasy, or the equally-instinctual (but perhaps, more morally virtuous, or not) Will to provide for their colony, is both mentally paralysed and physically weighed down by the frantic collection of pollen within her hind legs. Stepping on her (maybe peripherally sighting her before the fateful 'squashing' of her form), her sting, equally reflexive and naively instinctual, drove itself, through a (perhaps less 'sentient', but indeed therefore more) drive of its own, to pierce the skin of an assailant, in order to protect the body it is appended to, into the Sole of your foot. I'm certain, or pondering on the potential, that perhaps this sensorily Pavlovian, formative form of 'negative reinforcement', cemented the archetype of 'The Bee' as an 'inadvertent martyr', left helpless by their own desire to Help their 'in-group', and yet this very desire to Help causing you, a 'human', in the 'out-group', harm, which subsequently, contrastingly and in a complementary manner, Helped you to realise that things are not always quite as simply 'black and yellow' they seem. I'm sure, before you even read the Sixth Word of this Paragraph of ento-archetypal musings, your mind had already drawn in the concept of The Bee's sting, its only form of protection, being the very thing that is its end: a perfect symbol of how a 'population', or indeed any group of (individual) components (within a system of hierarchy), by its very organisation at 'higher' dimensional levels of observation, causes disarray and Harm to the single-units of life at the 'lower' levels, in order to preserve the Colony. 
What's more, perhaps, in fact, the most, is that this Bee Sting, insufficiently and yet necessarily, acts as the 'last resort' of protection for the individual. 
This is because, any life form, even us, so-called 'higher' examples of sentient life {even those of us (and there are many more than you may even be able to acknowledge, in your Hexagonal Hive of Imagined Machinations) who long for physical annihilation}, at our very core, strive to *Live*. 
This *'Living'* has been, entirely erroneously, become synonymous with 'Physical Self-Preservation'; when in fact {in many, countably infinite cases, transcendent of, and immanent within, population statistics, throughout every Sentient Syllable of The Symphony of Recorded Ecological Time}, the dissolution of the physical form into the Ocean of formless consciousness is indeed the *only way* for that individual to keep Living. 


Now, 
Imagine a wasp. 
I would not need to wager that this symbol, masquerading as the above symbol, provides an interesting archetypal counterpoint. I'd imagine that in your imagining, you could think of no person who 'reveres' wasps with the same sort of fractalised, impossibly antiSentia, antiDual amnesty from Harm-Causing that is afforded 'The Bee'. I'd imagine you imagining an entire world of imagineers, all not needing to imagine, but knowing, that the wasp is simply nefarious and to be avoided at all costs.

Now, again, and now and again, 
Imagine a soldier bee. 
I'd wager that this, in-between symbol, masquerading as a wasp masquerader, masquerading as 'The Bee', provided somewhat of a Question in your youth, with its every appearance about the Lavender of the fragrant and mysterious Jungle of the garden of your youth.  

and this,

Dear Jorges, is the answer I will leave you with:
