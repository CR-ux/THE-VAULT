An Excerpt from Noet. Borges' *Letters-*
Essays in Lexicomythographic Ræligious Studies, 23000BCE)

As we all know by now, in the reddest Herring of all recorded history, the aforementioned painting by One Mikkælangelovs David, is actually of Mars, who is late for a dinner date with Minerva, because he is rapt by compulsive **bulimia**, and staring at his own reflection in the toilet- tears dropping into the reflection and forming Daffodils of bile, as Lotus blooms on the Faecal pond. These images, discovered by fellow Noets, Sgt. S. Elk (maiden name reclaimed) and St. Myo Endive (creator of the Fare Well Device) have echoed throughout every syllable of tine, and forked all of our curiosities, particularly yours. 

What may or may not be striking to the observer is that the painter inexplicably managed to achieve a very-near emulation of a liquid, reflective surface upon a static plane coated with dried pigment. We believe David himself to have been a creation of static matter, being birthed into almost 'holographic' motion into our reælilty. These shocking yet unsurprising findings result from the incidental artworks-turned-alchemical-experiments performed by one CARPVS MORTVVM, in the emerging field of quantum sculpture.[^CM]

As the painting is now locked away in an attic somewhere, behind a veritable paywall of its own protection and demise, we pray that you understand why we cannot attach images to this correspondence. In fact, we are reminded fondly of our contemporary, *Magus'* work in one of our so-called 'caves', forbidding its own photographic capture, by its very fragility[^magus]).

Sincerely, 
Noet. Borges.

[^magus]: *The cave painting known as “The Sorcerer” was once located in the Cave of the Trois-Frères (_Grotte des Trois-Frères_), situated in the Ariège region of southwestern France.* It has since been absorbed through the process of Ligature Teleportation[^LT] to the Magura Caves, Bulgaria, where it sits atop a hexagonal chessboard pattern. Endivean Analysis has unveilled the titular, previously anonymised 'Sorcerer' as 'Topplegood'; the Grand Master.
