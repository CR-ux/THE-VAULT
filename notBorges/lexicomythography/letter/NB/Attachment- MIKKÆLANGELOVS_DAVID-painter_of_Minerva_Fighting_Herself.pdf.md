permalink: MIKKÆLANGELOVS DAVID - painter of Minerva Fighting Herself

ABSTRACT

---

What follows is an intronic splice from Noet. Borges' *Letters-*
*Essays in Lexicomythographic Ræligious Studies and the Ancient Art of Heartbreak*, 23000BCE. 

METHODOLOGY

---


The paper reveals an awareness of itself; through an overly complex and self-same narrative Device embedded by Borges into the Works of Jacques Luis David, now abandoned and unfinished, and tragically, never to be published during his Life. 


RESULTS

---


As we all know by now, in the reddest Her{ring} of all recorded history, the aforementioned painting by One Mikkælangelovs David, is actually of Mars alone, who is late for a dinner date with Minerva, rapt by compulsive bulimia, staring at his own reflection in the toilet- tears dropping into the reflection and forming Daffodils of bile, as Lotus blooms on the Faecal pond. These images, discovered by fellow Noets, Sgt. S. Elk (maiden name reclaimed) and Noet Myo Endive (creator of the Fair Well Device) have echoed throughout every syllable of tine, and forked all of our curiosities, particularly yours. 

What {may|may not} strike the observer is that the painter inexplicably managed to achieve a very-near emulation of a liquid, reflective surface upon a static plane coated with dried pigment. We believe David himself to have been a creation of static matter, being birthed into almost 'holographic' motion into our reælilty. These shocking yet unsurprising findings result from the incidental artworks-turned-alchemical-experiments performed by one CARPVS MORTVVM (now '*notBorges*'), in the emerging field of quantum sculpture.[^CM]


DISCUSSION

---


As the painting is now locked away in an attic somewhere, behind a veritable paywall of its own {pr|d}emise, {we|I} hope you understand why we cannot attach images to this correspondence. {I|We} {am|are} reminded fondly of our contemporary, *Magus'* work in one of our so-called 'caves', forbidding its own photographic capture, by its very fragility[^magus]. Carrying within it the submissive paradox of a receptive BDSM partner. 


CONCLUSION

~~~
I hope the work on your Tenth Symphony is going well, all the way over there, in the Musicology Wing. I pray that this *Letter* will reach you; and that by that time, perhaps you may wish to play me one of your Pieces again, on that baby grand in the centre of your office that you use as a desk; God, those coffee Rings, the loveliness of the poor tuning that you would get so excited about; the way the light has browned the keys, chipped from your manic violence inflicted on them as you played. The manic violence with which you afflicted my skin while we played; the percussion of the paddle, the eventual softening of your demeanour, pulling my hair ever so gently, as an epilogue to our fucking. Even the softening of your love for me, even our diminuendo; I would even accept that in place of this. I would sink into that, like your teeth once did into me. God, I miss it all so much. 

And until then, I Will Be. Ever adoring you, Mahler, my star, my cross, star-crossed love, my uncrossable door- I carry the ending of your Symphonies, 
I carry your start 
(I carry it in my Art);
		
Yours, Yores, Urs--

[^CM]: lexDef (Xlibris): {lexAllele(s)::: Noen} Quantum Sculpture is the very risky practice of allowing artwork to become aware of itself.
[^magus]: The cave painting known as “The Sorcerer” was once located in the Cave of the Trois-Frères (_Grotte des Trois-Frères_), situated in Southwestern France. It has since been absorbed through the process of Ligature Teleportation[^LT] to the Magura Caves, Bulgaria, where it sits atop a hexagonal chessboard pattern. Endivean Analysis has unveilled the titular, previously anonymised 'Sorcerer' as 'VIXI'; the Grand {Master|Scape{goat|serpent|pigeon}}.
