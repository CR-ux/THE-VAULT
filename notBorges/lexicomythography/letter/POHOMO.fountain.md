# Opening Hook

>> The Yellow Telephone, Or: "You Don't Have To Do Anything, Just Hold Onto It *Until 9P.M* ., and Then, 
>> 	plug it in <"
>> 		By a Nine Year Old Jorge Luis Borges, as part of his Radio Show Episodic series, aired on the cusp of the watershed at 9PM, titled: 
>> 			*Roes, Rows, Rose, Her Dream, Violently by The Moat:* an unfiltered exploration of the decidedly anticlimactic Final Act, of the utterly, repulsively, pseudoAcademic, bitterly detestable and perhaps even, fundamentally, yet so crucially, psychotically verbose and pathologically hypergraphic; so-called '*Conceptual Performance'* of the apparent "Callie Rose Petal" in questions's entirely dizzying, tumultuously challenging, deeply unrooted and disturbed, crushingly lonely unanswered question of her, often, but never, ever alone, fucking batshit weirdo Life --

FADE TO:

EXT. ONE OF THEIR RIBCAGES (DOESN'T MATTER WHICH) - DAY

A {redacted} Officer accidentally treads into a puddle of urine in a dingy restroom. She winces, hiding a strangely deranged smile.

POHOMO
See this is the thing. 

CUT TO:

*(un)just twelve {minutes|years} ago | in DAUNT (BOOKS | t{he/(i)r} favourite bookshop | in London*

POHOMO
I'm just talking to myself Here, 

POHOMO
I know, Oh, *trust me* I know. Which I know you'll know. 

POHOMO
But unknowingly (or {k}not) I think it's the unknown that fuels the knowing into motion? I don't even need to ask if you know what I'm talking about, because I just absolutely know that you do. 

POHOMO 
Totally. Say, no--

POHOMO (IN UNISON)
More.

POHOMO
But anyway. I really love the idea of using the pipe and bracket ciper, or the siphon,

POHOMO 
Siphonemes, wasn't it, you thought you'd call them? 

POHOMO
The characters? Totally. 

POHOMO
as in the individual members of the Research Society that is a Word in a Sentence that is A Prison that is a Prism that is a Shard that is exceptionally hard to decode and therefore known by everyone? 

POHOMO
(Sighing in relief, like a  not-too-recently but just-recently enough traumatised puffer fish finally able to relax )
Exactly. You get it. 

POHOMO 
What is there to get?

POHOMO
Right! 

POHOMO
I'm sorry I left. It wasn't okay

POHOMO
It wasn't, and it wasn't Right either, 

POHOMO (IN UNISON)
(anonymelodically, atonally) 

*but I'm gonna make it anyway* 

CUT TO:

EXT. POHOMO IS IN A FLAT WHICH IS NOT ON A FLAT SO THE DOORS AND SWIVEL CHAIRS AND STUFF AFFECTED BY GRAVITY FOR BEING SLIGHTLY REMOVED FROM IT ARE ALL AFFECTED IN ANNYING WAYS LIKE NEEDING DOORSTOPS AND TO SHOVE THE SHELF THAT YOUR EX LOVINGLY AND REALLY QUITE LOVINGLY WOODWORKED INTO A GORGEOUS ROSE COLOURED REMINDER OF THEIR CARE FOR YOUR ABILITY TO PUT A CUP OF COFFEE NEXT TO YOUR WAKING SLEEPY HEAD THAT MAYBE THEY KISSED WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING BUT DIDN'T KNOW BECAUSE YOU WERE ON A BED OF ONE OF THOSE TIMES YOU COULD CALL THE PIT OF A STOMACH OF A GREAT MACHINE MADE OF YOUR DEAD LOVED ONES WITH ONE FOOT LIKE A SLUG OR A SNAIL WITH ONE SOLE WITH A DARKEST DOLE OF YOU-JUST-WEREN'T-THINKING-RIGHT-OR-AT -LEAST -THAT'S -ALL -THAT'S -LEFT -NOW- NIGHT. - DAY


POHOMO
(sarcastically, seriously.)

I mean, we *Are* the same person, right?

POHOMO
(has left at this point, but I'd imagine, as I Right this, in my writing, what they might have said if they were still here, both of them I mean, obviously--)

*I mean, Obviously*

POHOMO
So none of this really *means* anything, Right?

POHOMO
Left out in the dark of knot knowing what the Nothing is, yeah!

POHOMO
All Right, no {k}ne{æ}d to be {me}an, absolute bitch {ab{o{u}}|t} it{s}!!!

POHOMO
Oh you're probably going to write ALL of this out later at your computer thinkign these EXACT words which I didn't EVEN SAY and then put it in this really confusing and over-complicated  triple nested meta-narrative that's so egregiously self-aware of pseudo-intellectualised that it's ostensibly literally senseless in its form. 

POHOMO
And as ALWAYS we WON'T even get to the POINT that I originally wanted to MAKE which was WHAT AGAIN?

POHOMO
Wait, wait a second, I've got this one, I can rewind enough; 

POHOMO
Thank FUCK, that's been the REÆLEST loss of me breaking up with you, has been me not having a conversational *bookmark* person, so think just for a SECOND, about hard it's been for *me?* All Right? 

POHOMO
Of course, you're Right, I'm Left in checkmate there--

POHOMO
So anyway what I wanted to say which I would have probably been reminded of if you were still here and reminding me of the batshit insanity that, for better or worse, I lose track of when you aren't here, would have been something like:

POHOMO
INT. MY FLAT. MAYBE LIKE A YEAR AGO OR SOMETHING OR LITERALLY ALL ETERNITY FOREVER OUT OF REACH BECAUSE IT'S INSIDE THE 'U' INSIDE OF THE WORD, 'US', FOREVER
  
*Where once I might have said something to you to the affect of:*

POHOMO
It's in the book.

POHOMO
If you'd just take a fucking 

POHOMO
(enthusiastically, al{{l}|one;}| taking a letter from their hundreds of tens of thousands of a countable infinity of characters; to create a magickal alphabet together that tells a billion stories through the {d|r}e{-}structuring of the cage of grammatic rules it was originally Told in / thus attempting, in futility, to turn a framework into a Cage; which is the only way {with}{in|out} {of} it. )
  
*SECOND*  
  

POHOMO
(TO: READ IT) 
*a letter on the floor of EXT. flat affect vocal recording that needs to be layered onto the new album but I need to write that here because otherwise I'll forget that basically, what we're doing here is becoming the Art itself and it's so wanky and douchey and by being so horribly disgustingly self-aware and naively thinking so much of *self* maybe actually it's more about helping everyone see at their deepest core they are just a story telling itself and all the stories are bound in a single thread as many beautifully dazzlingly unique component threads, smaller in size but incredibly denser in energy and everything we see and feel in every given moment is simply a cross section of a different reælity, where we travel through the dimension that cradles us, as a child clutches to a security blanket??

(FAO:SELF)*
don't tell

 you're Self

That will be crucial for the book, 

But you've already read it by now.

Totally. 

Right. 

you've been wrong about so many things. 

You never Left me. In your writing-

I'm what's Left. 

I know you won't ever make it right, 

Maybe you might even make it worse trying to write it, maybe not even consciously attempting to right it through writing, but now as you're writing it you're perhaps rightly, for the first time, discovering that this whole thing is born of an incessant need to show how much I want to be the open space for you that your unendingly bright spirit has provided for me for furl into countless, tumultuous, unforgettably meaningful times in a meaninglessly painful period of both of our short and fleetingly, gorgeously temporary existences as mirrors facing one another|UPGRADE SLUGLINE TO WRITE >6 PAGES
