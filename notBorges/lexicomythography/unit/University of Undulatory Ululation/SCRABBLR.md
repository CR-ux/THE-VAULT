1. Basic Game Functionality and Logic

~~- Tile Component: Start by creating a `Tile` component. This will allow you to encapsulate the styling and behavior of individual tiles, including displaying the letter and its point value in the bottom right, as in the real-life game. Making each tile its own component early on will help with both functionality and styling as your game develops.~~

~~- Tile Placement Restriction Logic: Implement the logic that restricts tile placement to horizontal or vertical lines and ensures tiles are placed in a contiguous fashion. This is a core part of the game's mechanics and will influence how players interact with the game board.~~

- Board Special Squares: Update your board initialization logic to include "DL", "TL", "DW", "TW" markings on special squares. This is relatively straightforward but essential for gameplay, as it directly affects strategy and scoring.

 2. Scoring and Game Progression

- Scoring Logic: Implement the basic scoring logic, including calculating the score for single tiles. This forms the foundation for more complex scoring calculations involving multipliers and word bonuses.

- Submit Turn Button and Logic: Add a button for players to submit their turn. This will involve checking that the placed tiles form a valid word(s), calculating the score for the turn, including any multipliers, and updating the game state accordingly.

- Scoreboard: Develop a simple scoreboard to track and display scores. This adds competitive elements to the game and is essential for multiplayer functionality.

 3. Advanced Game Mechanics

- Word Validation: Integrate a dictionary API for word validation. This can be considered a stretch goal but is crucial for ensuring that only valid words are played. Starting on this once the basic gameplay and scoring are in place makes sense.

- Tile Bag and Remaining Letters Display: Implement functionality to mimic the tile bag, drawing tiles after each turn, and displaying the number of remaining letters. This adds a layer of strategy regarding tile management.

 4. Multiplayer Functionality

- Turns and Multiplayer Logic: Implement logic for managing turns between multiple players. This includes ensuring the first turn meets the requirement of spanning the central square and that subsequent turns intersect with existing words.

- Multiplayer Support: Extend the game to support multiple players, either on the same device or potentially over a network. This will involve managing player states, turns, and scores.

 5. UI/UX Enhancements

- Stylized Tiles, Rack and Board: With the core functionality in place, focus on enhancing the UI. This includes adding styles to your `Tile` component to display scores as subscripts and designing the board to visually indicate special squares.

- Responsive Design: Ensure your game is playable across different devices and screen sizes. This might involve responsive design techniques to adjust the layout and size of game elements dynamically.

 6. Additional Features and Polish

- Game Instructions: Add clear instructions or an interactive tutorial for new players.

- Undo Action: Implement an undo feature to allow players to take back their last move before submitting their turn.

- Sound Effects and Animations: Consider adding sound effects for tile placements, successful word creation, and other interactions to enhance the user experience.
