**tongue 0 asked:**



Is That 'circular writing of lexicomythography' in 'knot about a Boat[^Boat] is'- it?




**the 10 others replied:**



Never odd or even, 

√¶ (i)s (f)or saying √¶nything, but civic. 

Ten deified's Tenet, Ever Met: 

Ne (M)
	e.g. ANA+ [^ANA]

	Reve[^reve]
Tenets' Deified Net, 
	Civic Tub: Gniht.[^Gniht]
	"Y"?

never odd or even.



It's about "tonk" (a really loud thwack, in lexicomythographic writing circles, that is)

















there was once a metal on earth called tungsten

and it was used for many useful and harmful reasons 

and after everything happened, we tried to piece it all together in the aftermath, 

and so many of us, being as mythopoeically biased as many of us are, 

failed to recognise that the word 'tungsten'

did not in fact refer to a group of Ten 

{severed | spoken} {Tongues | languages} 

(X)



but its symbol wasn't 'X' it was W, [^Wa] for Tungsten[^W] which is from Wolfram which comes from Wolframite which means Wolf-{Mark|Dirt|Soot} or if a person's name, possibly Wolf-Raven.

Quoth the Wolf-Raven:

> *Never odd or even, Evermore*
