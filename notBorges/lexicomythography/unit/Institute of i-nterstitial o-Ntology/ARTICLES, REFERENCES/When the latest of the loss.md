When the latest of the loss
Floats down as a blanket, 
Or like a sighing sky: 
Over all that we can see -
Are we rapt by mourning yet another,
Or the same self that could never be?
We want a love that immolates 
Like cigarettes left unextinguished,
Through a worn out unsprung armchair
We ask for love that eats the air 
All we want is in the wanting 
(No)
What we crave is in the craving 
(An unscratched itch, cracked open pavement)
No wish to be saved, 
But we covet the saving 
in truth of the ruthlessness 
let us lay down there lying 
All of us here are, bar none, crying 
(Dying)
for absolutely No Thing 
(As all things will disappear)
And in the spoils of all our years 
Vying
for not a single Thing 
but the crying 
Of our quiet little tears

How do I 
Why am I 
How do I stop 
How do I 
Why do I 
Maybe I just forgot 
How do I 
Who am I 
I am that I am the rot 
Why do I 
Who am I 
I am that which you are not 


Why does the middle of my body
Draw in such dark emptinesses 
If I take up too much space 
I’ll disappear into recesses darker than the underside of every fleeting earthly feeling 
In the relief i have printed all the messages of loveliness and burnt you in an ephegy to flee the freedom of this mess then crept inside the yellow of the wallpaper’s distressing tests incessant in the cesspit that my heart lives within
Love 
Li
Ness 
Let love 
Be loneliness
