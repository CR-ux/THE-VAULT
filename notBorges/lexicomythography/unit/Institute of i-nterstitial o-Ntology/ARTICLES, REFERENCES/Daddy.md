Daddy 
needing to be needed 
Is never wanting to see me again

My shoes are all worn down 
Left elsewhere to be collected 
The heels are too short 
(Too high to begin with) 
And the glue has become unstuck 
Holding nothing in anymore 
Just displaying all the dirt 
And my toes, pushed and crushed 
Into a space too small 
Up to the front of my mind 
Walked all over 
They hurt 

The selfishness
Of a single step 
Stepping out into rain 
Mist congeals my makeup 
Made up of all the dewdrops 
Of my childhood days 

A greyness 
Greyer than the hair on the sides of your head 
Daddy only loved me 
In the Spring
