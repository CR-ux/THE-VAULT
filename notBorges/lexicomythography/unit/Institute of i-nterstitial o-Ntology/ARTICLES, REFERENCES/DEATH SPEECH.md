---
I’ve been round the light of the Sun almost 28 times 
But now, here, with all of you, I feel light all around me
If I could just show baby Callie a second of these last three years of my life, everything would have been so different 
I never imagined I could be so loved 
I never imagined I could love myself 
I never imagined any of the beauty I’ve felt at the end could be felt by someone like me 
I’ve experienced countless deaths, countless transformations, countless annihilations, again, over and over, over and over, incessantly pushing my boulder up a hill littered with bricks of towers I tried to build, with swollen, bleeding bodies, with the warped memories of my family members, my past selves, my lovers lost, everyone who ever touched my heart
And now, as it beats its final rhythm, as the diminuendo ensues and the symphony of my life comes to a close, I feel more gratitude than I’ve ever felt
To be. 
That is what you all have taught me 
And what greater gift is there than to be present in this final moment with you all 
And wherever I’m going, I know you’ll all be there with me 
So say goodbye to my body, say goodbye to your own, say goodbye to everything that takes corporeal form
Because contained within the transience is a permanence 
That far transcends the physical 
And none of us ever truly die 
A wave returns to the ocean 
As the Sun glistens on its surface 
—
You are pure light 
We are light 
We are dwelling in light 
We are the remembering of providence 
You have changed me 
And now I am change 
You have loved me 
And now I am love 
I only ever knew death  
But you have given me life 
—
I love you all,
and from this wearying world to the next 
I will be singing to you through the wind in the leaves of the trees 
Never forgetting what it felt like
For just a miniscule droplet 
In the deepest trench 
of the ocean of time  
To be
