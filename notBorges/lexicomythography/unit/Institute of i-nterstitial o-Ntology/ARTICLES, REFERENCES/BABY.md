Mythology of abandonment - Dido 

Dad 







ONE DAY SHE’LL LOVE HERSELF 
ENOUGH TO LEAVE YOU 
OR MAYBE YOU’LL HATE YOURSELF 
ENOUGH TO HIT HER TOO 
YOU MUST’VE HATED ME ENOUGH 
TO KICK ME SO HARD BETWEEN THE LEGS 
OR WAS IT JUST THE YOU I REPRESENT 
AND I HATED MYSELF ENOUGH TO FORGIVE 
(IT’S A GOOD THING YOU KICKED ME THERE I GUESS )
IN LIEU OF ALL THE TIME WE SPENT 
IT GIVES ME AN EXCUSE TO LIVE 
TO LOVE THE THOUGHT OF YOU A LITTLE LESS 
IT GIVES ME A BITTER ROTTING NOT 
TO TIE UP ALL THE HATEFUL MAYBES 
I GUESS IM GRATEFUL FOR THE WAY YOU KICKED ME 
IN THE SPACE YOUR FACE LEFT 
In BETWEEN MY LEGS 
IVE BEEN SO WRUNG OUT IN DOUBT OF NEW LIFE LATELY
GOOD THING I COULD NEVER HAVE YOUR BABIES

CAN ONE OF US 
JUST DIE NOW 
SO I CAN 
LIFT UP MY FOOT 
AND TAKE A STEP
AGAIN 



IT WOULD BE BETTER IF 
ONE OF US WAS DEAD 
IT WOULD BE SO MUCH BETTER 
IF ONE OF US WAS DEAD 

IT WOUULD BE SO MUCH BETTER 
IF ONE OF US COULD JUST BE DEAD 

OR BOTH OF US COULD JUST BE DEAD 

JUST KILL US BOTH AND FINISH THE JOB 
YOU ALREADY STARTED IT 

Just looking for a way to die 
Just looking for an excuse to do it 

I wasn’t looking for you to love me
Or looking for love at all 
I was looking for a way through 
For a quicker  way to fall
