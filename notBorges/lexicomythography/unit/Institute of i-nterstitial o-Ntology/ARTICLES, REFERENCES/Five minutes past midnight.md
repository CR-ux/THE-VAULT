Deciding: I can’t stop crying 
Lying next to you 
Can’t stand the thoughts
Of my fledgling body, bleating
(It gets like this when the day’s been long)
Or the week’s not left a breath in me 
Or the month has worn a hole in me 
Or the years gone wrong inside of me 
Or the life won’t stick to any side of me 
Front door button singing: 
Sound asleep already 
I’m sure 
As blissfully at peace as I’d hope you would be 
What else would I be hoping for 
Sick of self-stabbing questions 
And sickly sweat 
So caught up in rhetoric 
Waking up wishing 
I could let myself sleep 
Surely someone has made a grave mistake 
The time allocated was simply not enough 
The shutters always fall too soon 
So why would I decide to shut them 
while light still bravely enters the room
I thought I had caught that slippery and elusive thing, 
like a fragile insect in my hand 
Like the final whisper of a plague,
Desperate inevitability
To become the emptying intestine 
Not empty enough 
before a fuck 
And all the crumbling aqueducts 
I emptied who I thought I was into 
Three hundred and ten miles down in a day
And now I just can not stop crying 
Arms crossed across my breasts, as if to say 
“At least I can never run away from these” 
And I’ve made it not-home now 
And no loneliness however chosen 
could be or taste as sweet 
As the sweetness of your arms 
Knowing this so sullenly 
In the poison of my attitude 
I walked back to my house 
because I couldn’t stand the truth of it 
Knowing this:
Within the ovum 
In the exit 
Of the heart’s great and creaking gate 
The rule book are indecipherable 
But one thing is for sure 
(we all find out too late) 
 I’ll never be anything 
But exactly what I meant 
To be
To you 
And of course 
What hurts 
What could ever on earth be worse:
I’ll only ever get to be 
in every single thought born world 
Exactly what I mean 
To me
