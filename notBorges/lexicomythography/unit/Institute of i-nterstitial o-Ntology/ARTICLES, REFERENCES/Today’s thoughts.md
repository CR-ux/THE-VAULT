Schopenhauer was like Chopin in that they both bring me a paradoxical satisfaction through a pessimistic viewpoint 

Schopenhauer was probably right that the positive state of existence is evil and the negative good, but might have missed the point of why this is 

Survival is the avoidance of annihilation 
Annihilation takes different forms and has varying likelihood for different people 
Therefore survival requires subjectivity 
In our current state of existence, subjectivity is not possible without bias 
In order to relinquish harmful bias, we must first imagine what an existence where subjectivity and bias are mutually exclusive might look like 
Surely it must begin with embodying the consciousness that connects all life through the Good 
In simple terms, being present, being Now 
Where an opinion (i don’t like this / this is enjoyable / this person is qualified for this job / this person’s experience of their gender while different from mine is still valid ) is not contingent upon or influenced by memories of the past or expectations of the future, be they from the collective subconscious, the personal subconscious, or the conscious mind. 


What might happen if all the humans of the world were to be present in their bodies at the same time? 

If, just for a moment, everybody’s ruminations on  past and future fell away, and all were Now, the only moment there is?
