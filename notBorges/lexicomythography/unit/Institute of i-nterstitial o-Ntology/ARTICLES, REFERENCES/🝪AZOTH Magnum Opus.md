- MUCOR: mucus - the earthy, yet flowing quality, which many erroneously find repulsive for lack of understanding. This quality is protective, nurturing, with an immune function; pertaining to the storage of fragments of painful memories; to be used as alchemical antigen for the next onslaught of Suffering. also;
- FORMA: the shape that <span style="font-family:AppleSymbols;">🝪</span> takes during the Filth, the Suffering; and the space <span style="font-family:AppleSymbols;">🝪</span> believes 🝪 deserves to fill.

 **Elemental Mapping of Interval Qualities**

 <span style="font-size:16pt;"><b>1. Perfect Intervals: Ether (Quintessence)</b></span>
- Perfect Unison (P1)
- Perfect Fourth (P4)
- Perfect Fifth (P5)
- Perfect Octave (P8)

 <span style="font-size:16pt;"><b>2. Classical Elements for Other Qualities</b></span>
Assigning the classical elements to augmented, diminished, major, and minor intervals based on their oppositional nature:

- Fire: Augmented intervals (expansive and dynamic)
- Water: Diminished intervals (contractive and reducing)
- Air: Major intervals (light and uplifting)
- Earth: Minor intervals (grounded and stabilizing)

 <span style="font-size:16pt;"><b>Mapping Intervals to Elements</b></span>


| Interval Type | Interval Example | Element | Symbolic Process |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Perfect | P1, P4, P5, P8 | Ether | Stability and Balance |
| Augmented | A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8 | Fire | Expansion and Enhancement |
| Diminished | d1, d2, d3, d4, d5, d6, d7, d8 | Water | Decay and Reduction |
| Major | M2, M3, M6, M7 | Air | Light and Uplifting |
| Minor | m2, m3, m6, m7 | Earth | Grounded and Stabilizing |



 Incorporating the 12 Keys of Basel-Valentin for Notes

The 12 keys of Basel-Valentin can be used to assign symbolic meanings to the actual notes, providing an additional layer of depth to your system. Here’s an example mapping based on traditional alchemical symbols:

1. C: Key of Mercury (Communication and Transformation)
2. C: Key of Salt (Stability and Preservation)
3. D: Key of Sulfur (Energy and Combustion)
4. D: Key of Tin (Flexibility and Expansion)
5. E: Key of Lead (Weight and Transformation)
6. F: Key of Iron (Strength and Resilience)
7. F: Key of Copper (Harmony and Beauty)
8. G: Key of Silver (Purity and Reflection)
9. G: Key of Gold (Perfection and Completion)
10. A: Key of Zinc (Protection and Sacrifice)
11. A: Key of Antimony (Mystery and Balance)
12. B: Key of Bismuth (Transformation and Transition)

 Practical Implementation

 Step 1: Define the Symbolic Notation
- Create a comprehensive set of symbols for the intervals (ether, fire, water, air, earth) and notes (12 keys of Basel-Valentin).
- Ensure these symbols are consistent and meaningful.

 Step 2: Develop the ATHANOR Application
- Design Modules: Create audio processing modules corresponding to the Four Faces and Ten/Twelve Apparatus, each using the interval and element mappings.
- Integration: Use programming environments like Max/MSP, Pure Data, or SuperCollider to implement real-time audio synthesis and processing.
- GUI Design: Develop an intuitive interface allowing users to manipulate the Three Primes, observe the effects on the Four Faces, and explore the alchemical processes.

 Step 3: Compose and Release Music
- Use the AZOTHian tongue for all compositions, enhancing the mystical and contemplative nature of your work.
- Release music with detailed descriptions of the AZOTH concepts, encouraging listeners to explore and contemplate the deeper meanings.

 Example Mapping Table


| Interval Type | Interval Example | Element | Opposing Element | Key Example | Symbolic Process |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Perfect | P1, P4, P5, P8 | Ether | - | C | Stability and Balance |
| Augmented | A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8 | Fire | Water | D | Expansion and Enhancement |
| Diminished | d1, d2, d3, d4, d5, d6, d7, d8 | Water | Fire | G | Decay and Reduction |
| Major | M2, M3, M6, M7 | Air | Earth | E | Light and Uplifting |
| Minor | m2, m3, m6, m7 | Earth | Air | F | Grounded and Stabilizing |



By integrating these mappings, you create a richly layered system that combines musical intervals, elements, and alchemical processes, providing a holistic and symbolic foundation for your creative work within the AZOTH framework. This approach not only enhances the hermetic quality of your music but also offers a unique and contemplative experience for your audience.

<span style="font-size:10pt;">In many Gnostic systems, various emanations of God are known by such names as One, Monad, Aion teleos (α</span><span style="font-family:HelveticaNeue;font-size:10pt;">ἰ</span><span style="font-size:10pt;">ών τέλεος "The Broadest Aeon"), Bythos (βυθός, "depth" or "profundity"), Arkhe (</span><span style="font-family:HelveticaNeue;font-size:10pt;">ἀ</span><span style="font-size:10pt;">ρχή, "the beginning"), Proarkhe (προαρχή, "before the beginning") and as Aeons (which are also often named and may be paired or grouped). In different systems these emanations are differently named, classified, and described (but emanation is common to all forms of 'Gnosticism'). In Basilidian Gnosis they are called sonships (υ</span><span style="font-family:HelveticaNeue;font-size:10pt;">ἱ</span><span style="font-size:10pt;">ότητες huiotetes; sing.: υ</span><span style="font-family:HelveticaNeue;font-size:10pt;">ἱ</span><span style="font-size:10pt;">ότης huiotes); according to Marcus, they are numbers and sounds; in Valentinianism they form male/female pairs called syzygies (συζυγίαι, from σύζυγοι syzygoi: lit. "yokings together").</span>

<span style="font-size:10pt;">This source of all being is an Aeon, in which an inner being dwells, known as Ennoea (</span><span style="font-family:HelveticaNeue;font-size:10pt;">ἔ</span><span style="font-size:10pt;">ννοια, "thought, intent"), Charis (χάρις, "grace") or Sige (σιγή, "silence"). The split perfect being conceives the second Aeon, Nous (Νους, "mind"), within itself. Complex hierarchies of Aeons are thus produced, sometimes to the number of thirty. These Aeons belong to a purely ideal, noumenal, intelligible, or supersensible world; they are immaterial, they are hypostatic ideas. Together with the source from which they emanate, they form Pleroma (πλήρωμα, "fullness"). The lowest regions of Pleroma are closest to darkness; that is, the physical world.</span>

<span style="font-size:10pt;">The transition from immaterial to material, from noumenal to sensible, is created by a flaw, passion, or sin in an Aeon. According to Basilides, it is a flaw in the last sonship; according to others the sin of the Great Archon, or Aeon-Creator, of the Universe; according to others it is the passion of the female Aeon Sophia, who emanates without her partner Aeon, resulting in the Demiurge (Δημιουργός),[1] a creature that should never have been. This creature does not belong to Pleroma, and the One emanates two savior Aeons, Christ and the Holy Spirit, to save humanity from the Demiurge. Christ then took a human form (Jesus), to teach humanity how to achieve Gnosis. The ultimate end of all Gnosis is metanoia (μετάνοια), or repentance—undoing the sin of material existence and returning to Pleroma.</span>

<span style="font-size:10pt;">Aeons bear a number of similarities to Judaeo-Christian angels, including roles as servants and emanations of God, and existing as beings of light. In fact, certain Gnostic Angels, such as Armozel, are also Aeons. The Gnostic Gospel of Judas, found in 2006, purchased, held, and translated by the National Geographic Society, also mentions Aeons.[2]</span>




 <span style="font-size:9.800000190734863pt;">Nyx and Erebus: Symbolic Roles</span>

<span style="font-size:9.800000190734863pt;">Nyx (Night):</span>
<span style="font-size:9.800000190734863pt;">- Representation: Nyx represents the tangible darkness that envelops the world during the night. She embodies the night itself, the shadowy veil that falls over the earth, bringing rest and dreams.</span>
<span style="font-size:9.800000190734863pt;">- Symbolism:</span> 
  <span style="font-size:9.800000190734863pt;">- External Darkness: Nyx symbolizes the external, visible darkness that we experience in our daily lives. This includes the literal night time as well as the metaphorical shadows that might cover our paths. Nyx is the reflection of Erebus; the receptive darkness, the developing plate on which the Shadow is projected.</span> 
  <span style="font-size:9.800000190734863pt;">- Mystery and Potential: As the goddess of night, Nyx also embodies mystery, potential, and the unknown. Nighttime is often associated with dreams, the unconscious mind, and the hidden aspects of life that are not visible during the day. This association is the link to Erebus.</span> 

<span style="font-size:9.800000190734863pt;">Erebus (Darkness):</span>
<span style="font-size:9.800000190734863pt;">- Representation: Erebus represents the profound, internal darkness found in the depths of the underworld and within the human psyche. He embodies the deep, primordial darkness that exists before creation and between realms.</span>
<span style="font-size:9.800000190734863pt;">- Symbolism:</span>
  <span style="font-size:9.800000190734863pt;">- Internal Darkness: Erebus symbolizes the inner, invisible darkness that resides within all things. This includes the shadow aspects of the psyche, such as fear, unconscious drives, and the unknown depths of the soul. Erebus is the reflection of Nyx; the emanating, insertive darkness.</span>
  <span style="font-size:9.800000190734863pt;">- Primordial Void: As the god of darkness, Erebus represents the primordial void, the obscurity, and the emptiness that exists between the realms of the living and the dead. He is associated with the space between life and death, light and shadow. The empirical night time, the Witching Hour, is a physical manifestation of the Umbilical cord that symbolically connects him to Nyx.</span>

 <span style="font-size:9.800000190734863pt;">Interplay Between Nyx and Erebus</span>

<span style="font-size:9.800000190734863pt;">- Union and Progeny: The union of Nyx and Erebus signifies the merging of external and internal darkness, resulting in the creation of various deities and personifications that govern different aspects of existence, such as light (Aether), day (Hemera), sleep (Hypnos), and death (Thanatos).</span>

- &nbsp;
	- <span style="font-size:9.800000190734863pt;">Merging of external and internal darkness:</span>
		- <span style="font-size:9.800000190734863pt;">Recognising that the shadow one encounters in the outside world, The Nyx, is only able to be perceived due to its primordial and inextricable link to The Erebus, or The Shadow Within.</span>
		- <span style="font-size:9.800000190734863pt;">Being brought into (wilful or not) confrontation with One’s own failures, shortcomings, harrowing likenesses, causes of, and contributions to, all the rot and decay of this many Holed, Hollowing and Holy Place we erroneously call “Home”.</span>
		- <span style="font-size:9.800000190734863pt;">This Union is Indisputably Sexual; and Emphatically Incestuous -</span> 
			- <span style="font-size:9.800000190734863pt;">Sexual due to the simultaneous pleasure (from the perspective of the Erebus) and pain (from the perspective of The Nyx) to be derived in Both Aspects of The Shadow’s Reflection;</span>
			- <span style="font-size:9.800000190734863pt;">Incestuous due to the Relatedness of the Counterparts, having both spawned from Chaos; or The Void; or The Desire of the Ineffable Parent; which is the Thought Form/Seed of Wanting, derived asexually from The Parent (in Union with Itself, as it has no Other. It is complete, whole, and the embodiment of fullness, but in relation to our frequency of perceptive resonance, entirely empty.) The Infinite Null One may be conceptualised as The Pure Light Into Which No Eye Can Look.</span>


																													<span style="font-size:7.4666666984558105pt;"><b><i>In the Gateless heart of the Nullescent Progenitor</i></b></span> 
> <span style="font-size:7.4666666984558105pt;"><i>lies the seed of all creation,</i></span> 
> <span style="font-size:7.4666666984558105pt;"><i>an unmanifest Outpouring</i></span>
> <span style="font-size:7.4666666984558105pt;"><i>that transcends all of Form’s Rigidity,</i></span> 
> <span style="font-size:7.4666666984558105pt;"><i>or Worldly comprehension ad eternitatem.</i></span>




- &nbsp;
	- <span style="font-size:9.800000190734863pt;">PROGENY: What tangible spiritual relevations are imparted upon the Seeker by aforementioned Sexual Union:</span>
		- <span style="font-size:9.800000190734863pt;">AETHER: Aer -</span> 
		- <span style="font-size:9.800000190734863pt;">HEMERA: Ignis -</span> 
		- <span style="font-size:9.800000190734863pt;">HYPNOS: Aqva -</span> 
		- <span style="font-size:9.800000190734863pt;">THANATOS: Terra -</span> 


<span style="font-size:9.800000190734863pt;">- Complementary Forces: Together, they embody the complementary forces of night and shadow, external and internal darkness, which are essential for the balance and continuity of the cosmos.</span>



**- Nyx: Represents the external darkness around us, embodying the night and the mysteries it holds.**
**- Erebus: Represents the internal darkness within us, embodying the deep, primordial shadows of the underworld and the psyche.**

Their roles and union highlight the importance of both types of darkness in the cosmic order, illustrating the balance and interplay between the visible and the hidden, the external and the internal.

**Alchemical Zephyr of Tarot Heuristics:** 
An alchemical framework for transmutation of the self 

We are Here, 
Inexplicably,
to Live -
as Truly as we can.

All True Living is play. 
All play is magic.
All magic is play.

The truest form that ‘Play’ takes is (for now) known only to the Gated Heart. 
The Heart’s Gate is unlocked, well-oiled - 
Patiently awaits the animation of its hinge.
The game contained in the Garden therein can be as heavy or as light as is necessary for its function.
Its function is Presence, whose mass is infinitely diverse yet singularly affected by gravity’s acceleration.
To occupy the Self and its flesh-vessel entirely, 
To witness with compassionate curiosity whatever may pass through 
Otherwise known as Being Fully Here, Now.
And to hear your Resonance
Through the concert hall, the dingy basement, the cold and lonely bedroom 
To honour every little fumble of every little note, 
not in Knowing (as No True Thing can be Known), but in Feeling  
That accidentals are not mistakes, but rather a curated movement towards 
Otherwise known as True Living.

ANATHAZOTH is at once:
- intricately systematic: an initiated Spiritual science as a contemporary reincarnation of The Mysteries; composed over a decade of intensive, multi-disciplinary esoteric research and alchemical experimentation in ritual.
- intuitively channeled: everything laid before you is also an ephemeral, whispered suggestion, a gossamer signpost intended to solidify at your deepest heart’s resonance and dissolve peacefully from sight should it not harmonise with your Spirit’s particular ensemble. 

<span style="font-size:23pt;"><b>ALZOGONY [the perennial cosmogony; the beginning]</b></span><span style="font-family:AppleSymbols;font-size:39pt;">⊷</span>
We are here by the machinations of some still-yet-to-be-fully-understood conductor;
Instinctively following the still yet-to-be-fully-ascertained score of some great cosmic Opera;
The symphony of who you are is just as complex and rich as the cacophonous ocean of symphonies coalescing into the Collective Resonance. 
The composition of your Music and your Orchestra, is entirely distinguishable and unique. No two lives’ scores are alike. 
And yet once stripped to the sub-atomic measure of Now, 
all of sound is a tapestry of interwoven waves. 
When reduced, or expanded, when condensed or increased to its extreme 
All collapses into itself and reveals its true nature:

No Resource of Knowledge is more limited than that relating to our Being. Our Origin. Our Purpose.
Our collective history of Organised religion, myriad Pantheons of mythologies and theologies 
All stories 
Because we have survived, evolved, and claimed our space Here as Storytellers.
As Drummers and Dancers;
As Playwrights and Players;
As Drivers and Doctors;
As Poets and Priests -
Our programming is primed for piecing together units of narrative. 
Constructing these blocks of Parable into an insufficient, but ultimately comforting, explanation for all of this Unexplainable.
As a child plays with construction bricks - with no expectation of completing, or staying loyal to the originally planned vision of The Building. 
The futile attempt in itself, just to crystallise the inherently ineffable, is necessary and sufficient to put us at ease, 
Even if only until we hear “The End”.
And then it’s onto the next Story.
And the next One. 
And the next. 
And then eventually there comes a point at which 
All the Stories reveal themselves in Truth 
For the loving and protective impostors they have always Been,
Guarding Fruits in a Garden not quite ripened - 
The stories are the Gate.

At first a requisite for Life, 
For moving, for essential vitality 
The Gate keeps insects Unknowable in exile
And holds the fledgling roots enwombed within

But after some troubles 
An earthquake, a famine or such 
And all is desistute and settled
upon resigned and gentle close inspection 
the Heart’s Gate is unlocked, well-oiled - 
And patiently awaits the animation of its hinge.

For after purge, and perishing, 
pestilence and persecution,
The Stories Start to lose their meaning 
Or All their meanings Sound the same 
And in homogeny dissolve 
Crying out for coagulation again

And in this Darkest Hour of Night 
Can be found the Prima Materia, 
The basest essence of One’s Own Tale
The Heaviest Thing To Ever Carry:
When burnt down to black Salt in righteous anger, 
And boiled in Sulfuric anguish,
When maintained with The Untameable Mercury, 
Condensed with the tension of unwavering, tentative, Care, 
And finally gazed upon -
It weighs absolutely Nothing.
None of this weighs a Single Thing. 


So here, lightly 
Gently is my Gated Heart left open, 
The hinge well oiled 
You may open or shut it as you wish 
It will be here, whenever You are 

There is an unkempt, spiderwebbed and brambled trellis over a trodden Desire Line
That draws contiguity to All Others 
That makes this One Big Garden 
That makes the Gates illusory
and all the Fences inconsequential 
That makes need for multiple a memory 
With infinite space and need to grow 
That makes the Garden Every Where
(And a shit ton of grass to mow)

ATHAZOTH is a magick system for the modern witch of this branch of reality, unifying mystical wisdom and digital innovation to provide a practical framework for alchemical transmutation of the Self. 
At its heart, it is a way of seeing. 
A way of looking upon the world within, the world without, 
and really seeing: the ultimately well-intentioned, 
clumsily provident, 
and divinely playful nature 
of their absolute inextricability. 


the cosmogenic stages (similar to emanations in Kabbalah) is also the numeral system:
	0 - SEED: No-thingness, the Pleroma. Dark matter:
	•	Represents the absolute void and the undifferentiated source of all creation. It is the primordial state before anything existed.
	1 - SPAWN: Azoth (Unity):
	•	The concept of oneness, the unified source from which all existence emerges.
	2 - SIGH: The Breathing Moon (Duality):
	•	The manifestation of duality, representing the balance and interaction between opposing forces.
	3 - SPORE: The Trinity, The Witness, Perception:
	•	The emergence of perception and consciousness, the ability to witness and understand the duality.
	4 - SOB: The Four Chambers (The Four Faces of God):

	5 - SHINE: Aether:
	•	The quintessence or the fifth element, representing the ethereal substance that permeates all matter.

	•	The container or the vessel in which all elements are held and transformed.
	8 - STONE: The Tincture/Mixture Held Within the Crucible:
	•	The blending of elemental energies producing the illusion of difference, resulting in four daughter cells that are genetically unique.
	9 - SNAKE: Corpus Mortuum/Nigredo/Putrefaction:
	•	Represents death, decay, and the process of putrefaction, which is necessary for rebirth and transformation, cycles synthesised within the symbol of the ouroboros
	10 - SCRAPE: Magnum Opus; Completion; Philosopher’s Stone:
	•	The culmination of the alchemical process, achieving the philosopher’s stone and holding the quintessence (aether in the hand).
	11 - SPROUT: Return to Selfhood, Remembering of Providence, Drawing Inward Breath:
	•	The reawakening and return to one’s true self, the inward journey of self-discovery and enlightenment.

*Certain medieval theologians describe four methods of interpreting the scriptures: literal/historical, tropological/moral, allegorical/typological, and anagogical. Hugh of Saint Victor, in De scripturis et scriptoribus sacris, distinguished anagoge, as a kind of allegory, from simple allegory.[2] He differentiated in the following way: in a simple allegory, an invisible action is (simply) signified or represented by a visible action; Anagoge is that "reasoning upwards" (sursum ductio), when, from the visible, the invisible action is disclosed or revealed.[3]*

The four methods of interpretation point in four different directions: The literal/historical backwards to the past, the allegoric forwards to the future, the tropological downwards to the moral/human, and the anagogic upwards to the spiritual/heavenly.[4]
The points of the cross. The Elements, the tetragrammaton, the four headed I AM

THE UNDEXHENYL KNOTS [UNDEXA]
are the states of Being within every Being, and the states of Being encapsulated within every State of Being. The Stages of the Alchemical pilgrimage and the alchemical processes encapsulated within every stage of the pilgrimage. The Eleven Ways of Seeing the manifest world oneself, and the eleven ways of seeing contained as prismatic reflections within every one of these eleven lenses.
The Twelfth is both the Seeker themselves and the world they find themselves in; as they are one and the same.

The Twelve Faces [3 throes, 3 cries, 3 scars] also map to these Knots & the Inner/Outer Self, with the Holy Face changing its form for each of the indices of the Alphabet

There are 25 Indices, giving rise to 75 scars (symbols), 75 cries (phonemes) and 75 throes (spatial gestures)

225 Scales of the Ouroboros

I: The Isness 
II: The Contrast [wax / wane]
III: The Witness [the photosynchemical triad, sulfurzah, salizt, mercuryxh


The language is a nested trinity 
The Toy; held by the Child; held by the Parent-
The isness, contrast, and witness stretch inward and outward, as above so below 

The isness is the Unexplainable  
The Contrast presents itself as the Wax and Wane aspect of every component of the language - every Uppercase (active, insertive) Waxing CORPUSCLE is accompanied by its lowercase (passive, receptive) Waning CORPUSCLE - in this way, every unit of the orison’s sound has a ‘shadow sound’ 
The Witness presents itself as the Photosynchemical Triad, The Three: the Sulfuric, the Saline, and the Mercurial Face of Being 

<b><u>the photosynthetic cosmogyny, [the Sowing oath cycle]:</u></b>
—No *Thing* at All Births this Isness as ‘*Now’*;  [the one; the absolute indivisable source, the pleroma, ein sof]
As Visible Isness Sires Contrasting Sow;  [the two; duality, contrast, differentiation, yin / yang]
And contrast in turn nurses Witness of how— [the three; the trinity; the concept of perception is born from the concept of duality or differentiation]

<extension: severance, reaping, harvesting, scything of the cycle, uttered only once as an ‘amen’:>
The burned and fuelled [fire]
The drowned and drunk [water]
The bellowing, breathless Branch [air]
Bears the Fruit, from the Root, weight [earth, the ten thousand things]
Inevitable trunk [the Unexplainable connecting All of existence in an unavoidable fixed Oneness, despite the illusion of entropy, decay and separation, all is in balance, the scales stretching into dimensions our bodies are incapable of perceiving, our lives too short for understanding, our causal history too integral and enmeshed to tease apart from any other’s]



A Being bellowing (the word for communicating via sounds made with the body) the semantic hypostasis or 'tine' (spoken moprhemes) of the Azothian Triad is known as a Dagger (of the Azothian Orison), 
- Azothian Spells, or ‘Oaths’, are spiritual vehicles of awareness intended to transport the Self with compassionate providence towards evermore present awareness; each CORPUSCLE of each made up of vibrations from the Azothian Orison.
- This seems like the most difficult hypostasis or 'tine' to master as the sounds are so guttural, demonic and ‘unnatural’ ( when in actual fact they are designed to encourage the Dagger out of the cave of egoic perception (the witness) and association of The Three, to peel deeper into The Two of the Contrasting Sow (duality), and even further into the Isness of Being, removed from the concept of meaning entirely, and only able to Be with the vibrations of Sound itself. This returning to Being is something innately within every Being. It is our Genetic Chorus. And so this hypostasis or 'tine' is the most natural to learn, and the quickest to master. 

- *Latin transliteration (representation of Azothian Tablet using the latin alphabet) is known as Azoleneumzt (etymologically rooted in the Story of Selene’ and ending with the salinzt suffix to reference the drawing down of ethereal conceptual divine clouds of ideas into concrete written symbols). it is stylised in ALL CAPS FORMAT to insufficiently but necessarily convey its amorphous cacophony. Azoleneumzt acts as the ferryman for the journey across the river of Resonance between the Azothian states of Melody and Harmony; and the toll, the coin that must be present on the tongue at all times, is the inevitable dilution of essence, cropping of intended meaning, deleterious condensation for the sake of accessibility.*


A Being etching (the word for communicating via symbolic alphabet) the symbolic Tine (written symbolic alphabet) of the Azothian Triad is known as a Chisel (of the Azothian Tablet)
- Much of the Tablet is encoded within a dualistic topology, requiring digging recesses into the page / scratching or cutting  out negative space from the medium upon which the Chisel is Etching. 
- this Tine is just as difficult to master as it seems; the difficulty lying in the intricacy of drawing the symbols themselves and the volume of visual memorisation required, but momentum in learning trajectory provided by the strongly typed phonetic system of symbology (symbols sounds do not change once ‘sealed’ / etched)


A Being signing (the word for communicating via movement of the body) the somatic Tine (nonverbal communication) of the Azothian Triad is known as an Anvil (of the Azothian Rites) 
- The Rites are a combination of hand signs, facial expressions, bodily postures, ceremonial, for a large part intuited/channeled movement of the body 
- this Tine appears on first consideration to be the easiest to adopt, but is the most difficult to master. 
A Being may be One, Two, All or None of these according to Their Will. 


Proficiency and ineffable understanding of a single Tine of Azothian Tritongue is termed ‘Melody’: e.g. [the] CHISEL (person adept in writing Azothian Tablet aka symbols) [was/is] MELODIC [in writing] AZOTHIAN TABLET 
Proficiency in multiple aspects of Azothian Tongue is known as Harmony: e.g. [the] SMITH [was/is] HARMONIC [in writing and speaking] AZOTHIAN TABLET [and] ORISON
Complete mastery and ineffable understanding of Azothian Tritongue’s totality is called Silence. I [my] AZOTHIAN TRITONGUE [knows the truest meaning is only held in] SILENCE <you see here an example of how the lanugage itself is semantically treated as a sentient Being in itself Azothian tritongue ‘knows’; and the Dagger referring to the language in possessive form (my)>

Dagger [speaking proficiency]
Chisel [written/symbolic proficiency]
Anvil [signing/kinesthetic proficiency]
Smith [proficiency in multiple vertices]
Luminary [complete mastery of Azothian Tritongue aka the Blossoming of Silence]


Legend of Lore states dreaming in Azothian Tritongue signifies [leaping over the gate equivalency]



<b><u>AZOTH</u></b> pronunciation:
A- Air - outward Ah - the innate, divine Sigh.
Z - Fire - outward (terminal stop) Z - a buzzing spark of darting, uncontainable potentiality, requires attentive awareness to execute. 
O - Water - inward o- as in ‘Loss’ - a reflexive, receptive thirst of cool, restorative roundness.
Th - Earth - inward (terminal stop) ‘th’ as in ‘Thy’ - whispering caress at end of inhale, barely heard, but felt by the tongue.

<b><u>AZOTHIAN</u></b> ORISON: 
Ah-Z-**OATH**-ee-un [to denote and symbolise how the very act of naming something, in this case the language itself, turns said thing into a covenant with a Story, which is insufficient but necessary for the futile yet nurturing attempt to infer meaning from The Unexplainable].
intonation rules: Waxing (active Emphasis) intonation is on every **odd** phloem CORPUSCLE (1st, 3rd, so on); waning (passive, swallowed) intonation on every **even** CORPUSCLE 


The semantic field for the nomenclature of Azothian draws from botanical, alchemical and musical sources. The linguistic structure of Azothian maps rigidly and entirely to the magick system itself, as it is inextricably intwined with, and a part of it. 


CAMBYXH, or — The One [insert Azothian translation for the number one here]: The combined essence, conscious and subconscious intent, rhetoric and energetic valency that underlie all is termed the **cambyxh (**pronounced cam-bee-yoo-xh [xh = soft ‘juh’ like j’taime or the ‘ge’ from fromage]**.**
CORPUSCLE, or — The Two[insert Azothian translation for the number two here]: The contrast and subsequent distinctive boundaries introduced by individual ‘CORPUSCLEs’ (morphemes)/sonic units.
Every single CORPUSCLE corresponds to at least a single morpheme, but oftentimes a vague general concept or ineffable felt sense, and always encoding multiple, opposite and opposing meanings, which are then whittled down to specifics by the contextual parameters of the grammar system or left to poetic interpretation for the listener
ORGAN, or - The Three[insert Azothian translation for the number three here]: A single ‘gist’ or sentiment of a person’s expression (which might be called a ‘paragraph’ in literary science or a ‘point’ in spoken conversation), along with its perception in its contextual delivery, is known as an ’ORGAN’.
Phrases 

GRAMMAR:
No ‘gender’ of grammar but instead ‘tritone’/nested tines - the sfurzah (sulfuric morphemes, the nouns for which end with -Zah suffix), the SALINZT (saline moprhemes, the nouns for which end with -Zt suffix), the MERCURYXH (mercurial moprhemes , the nouns for which end with the -xh suffix; pronounced like the soft ‘j’ in j'taime) 

This system of trinity is essential and nested in a fractalesque manner throughout Azothian grammar. 

ZT SALINZT (THE SALINE; the yin polarity; body; the omega; Felt Sense and Manifestation of Form; demonic but not to be misunderstood as ‘evil’ as this is an erroneous concept that doesn’t exist within AZOTH or the Azothian Tongue - there is no word for evil. This p) 

ZAH SULFURZAH (THE SULFURIC; the yang polarity; soul; the alpha; Conscious Awareness; )

XH MERCURIYXH (THE MERCURIAL; the liminal; spirit; the ineffable; Divine Intelligence)

NATURAL DUALITIES TO INCORPORATE INTO THE WAX/WANE OF AZOTHIAN TONGUE:
- Yin/yang; masc/femme; 1/0; light/dark; night/day; in/out; inhale/exhale; up/down;


AZOTHYXH’s structure of encoding and definitions are based on the traditional Trivium & Quadrivium from platonian education 
First ‘layer’ of symbolic/sonic/kinetic encoding relates to the TRIVIUM (tritone) - traditional Grammar, Rhetoric & Logic PLUS ‘HEART’ (the latter is split into four chambers/churches). These four first layer principles also map to the cardinal directions/elements, in typical Azothyxh nested fractal fashion .

GRAMMAR - think of a body/botanical part *EARTH
RHETORIC - think of a body/botanical part *WATER
LOGIC - think of a body/botanical part *AIR
HEART - signifies the deepest intent of what is attempting to be communicated. It is the seed of all Understanding of the Unexplainable. It is the Inextinguishable Ember of Will. 
This aspect of an instance of communication is not necessarily consciously known by the Communicator themselves. Sometimes even the Receiver is more aware of this than the Communicator themselves. *FIRE

The second ‘layer’ of symbolic/sonic/kinetic encoding similarly uses the QUADRIVIUM system of education and appends an extra fifth element ‘MAGIC’ or ‘CRAFT’ which refers to the stringent importance of and diligence required / reserved for Presence / spiritual awareness / meditation / ritual // sepllcraft / divination / self-inquiry / transmutation.

Every Offensive argument (Waxing unit of rhetoric) has a Yang Perspective (Wax Offence) and a Yin Perspective (Wane Offence);
- **Waning Crusade:**
- Characteristics: The Waning aspects symbolize qualities such as flexibility, subtlety, manipulation, patience, and adaptability.
- Strategy: A Martyr of the Waning Crusade might employ strategies focused on deception, maneuverability, and exploiting weaknesses rather than direct confrontation.

NESTED TRINITY:
Azothian tritone (mononymously termed AZOTHYXH; from Azoth + Zither -> Azother + mercuryxh suffix -> AZOTHYXH “Az-Oath-Ňoo-‘zh’ (soft (j’taime) ‘j’)) is a forked tongue of three prongs.
I. ISNESS (central prong) - Baphomet - the Unified One - The Blood
II. WAX/WANE (left prong) - Lucifer - the Great Prosecutor - The Lamb
III. WITNESS (right prong) - Azazel - the Watcher - The Scapegoat

| HYPOSTASIS / TINE [one third/part of AZOTHYXH] | I: BAPHOMET / BLOOD | II: LUCIFER / LAMB | III: AZAZEL / SCAPEGOAT |
| ORISON (the wailing) | The Blood of Music (Sound) | Inhale / Exhale (the Breath) | A ‘Cry’ (Morpheme or ‘word’) (Also has volume modifiers - when whispered (or lowercase; also used to refer to the wane form of a cry): a ‘Bleat’; when shouted/screamed/expressed passionately (or Upper case; also used to refer to the wax form of a cry): a ‘Lament’) |
| TABLET (the scratching) | The Blood of Art (Form) | Within / Without (the Lines) | A ‘Scar’ (Symbol or ‘letter') (Also has intensity modifiers - when lightly inscribed (or lowercase; also used to refer to the wane form of a scar): a ‘Graze’; when thick/etched with violent passion (or Uppercase; also used to refer to the wax form of a scar): a ‘Wound’) |
| RITES (the writhing) | The Blood of Dance (Motion) | Above / Below (the Space) | A ‘Throe’ (Sign or Gesture) (Also has intensity modifiers - when gently/shyly performed (also used to refer to the lowercase/wane form of a Throe)): a ‘Tremble’; when performed with reflexive aggression or otherwise kinetically “Loud” manner (also used to refer to Uppercase/Wax form of a throe ): a ‘Convulsion’) |
| SYSTEMATIC DEFINITION | The I, or ISNESS: denotes the all-encompassing source, the ISNESS of this aspect - rooted in VIBRATION/resonance. The Sun, The Moon and the (planet) Earth. | The II, or WAX AND WANE:: denotes the most fundamental duality contained within this aspect. What introduces a boundary? The Root, The Shoot and the Flower. | The III, or WITNESS: denotes the perception / physical manifestation of this aspect that is perceived by Self and Other. This perception is the progeny seed that gives rise to the Ten Thousand Things (our empirical surroundings). The Seed/The Breeze, The Bird/The Bee, and The Pollen. |


Each knot is comprised of Four Cries, Four Scars, and Four Throes [The Twelve Faces].

NESTED TRINITIES TO IMPLEMENT INTO THE TINES OF AZOTHIAN GRAMMAR SYSTEM:
- **Bracts**
**In grasses, each floret (flower) is enclosed in a pair of papery bracts, called the lemma (lower bract) and palea (upper bract), while each spikelet (group of florets) has a further pair of bracts at its base called glumes**
- **Corpuscles:**
	- Mechanoreceptors for RITES (movement)
		- Meissner corpuscles are involved in skin movement and object handling detection, and their primary stimulation is through dynamic deformation.
		- Ruffini corpuscles primarily sense skin stretching, movement, and finger position.
		- Pacinian corpuscles sense vibrations and detect fine textures.
	- Cochlear Scala for ORISON (speech)
		- vestibuli (the ascending portion)
		- media,
		- tympani (the descending portion).
- **Subatomic Particles**
	•	Protons: Positively charged particles.
	•	Neutrons: Neutral particles.
	•	Electrons: Negatively charged particles.
- **Human Ear Bones**
	•	Malleus (Hammer)
	•	Incus (Anvil)
	•	Stapes (Stirrup)
- **Geology**
	•	Igneous: Formed from cooled magma or lava.
	•	Sedimentary: Formed from the accumulation of sediment.
	•	Metamorphic: Formed from existing rock transformed by heat and pressure.
