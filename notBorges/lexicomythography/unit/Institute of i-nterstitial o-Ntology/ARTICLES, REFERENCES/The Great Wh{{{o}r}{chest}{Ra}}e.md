I dreamt I was a pianist and electronic instrumentalist in an orchestra sat next to {Jericho|Jezebel[^J]} from roslin who was a violinist 
At some point I left and I remember thinking how did I even get out without people seeing 
(I should start using that as a totem)
Then Three boys wanted to have sex with me 
So I got in the shower[^ritual] 


Which part of me is it that loves to be unhappy? 
How could such a heavy part remain un{h|b}idden for so much of the time? 
Which part of me is it that cannot allow any other part to exist?[^hold] 
Will I ever feel comfort in the asking of a question? Will I ever not feel pain at the silence of no response? 
Will any of this amount to anything? Or have I realised it all too soon? 
So much of me is crying out for forgiveness 
which sins I do {{k}not} k{now} to be es{{chew}[^c]ed} 
Hiding in depths of my Being{Loc{h|ked}}{m|N|ch}es{s|t} (a) Monster?

My hands, {they} are {k{not}ted}; 
fa{i{l(l)}|{d}(y)ing}--
An aching of the gr{eat}est amplitude

[^hold]: And which part of me holds all other parts together? 
[^ritual]: Sex begins with Ritual[^sex]
[^sex]: Sex =(/)= Ritual
