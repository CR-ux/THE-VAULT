GOALS:

Creates a small audio sample of set time from user inputted daily entry using Tone.js library of pre-prepared instruments  
Parameters such as instrument, octave, note, effects, are determined by sentiment of entry 
Collects samples over time, leading to a ‘symphony’ 
Daily samples = “measure”
Weekly collection of 7 merged samples = “phrase”
Monthly collection of 28/30/31 samples = “cadence”
Quarterly collection of ~90 days = “movement”
Yearly collection of 365 samples = “symphony”


User then has motivation to keep the chain of journal entries going, otherwise it leaves a ‘rest’ on a blank day (silence) 
Phrases should be 3 seconds long and nicely begin and end so to create a seamless piece of music 



MVP:
Sentiment is determined by user picking mood from radio buttons ? Simple skeleton functionality 

Final goal:
Sentiment is determined by NLP analysing user’s words from entry
