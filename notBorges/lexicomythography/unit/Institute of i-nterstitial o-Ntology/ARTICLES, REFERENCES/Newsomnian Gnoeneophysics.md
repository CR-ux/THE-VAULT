**Abstract**

Newsomnian Noeneophysics explores how Joanna Newsom’s music weaves perceptive realities through recursive lyricism, polyphonic textures, and mythopoetic structures. Her compositions collapse time and space, blending personal narrative with collective myth in a non-linear interplay of memory and meaning. By examining harmonic multiverses, linguistic tapestries, and symbolic EpiSentia within her work, this field positions her songs as ontological maps—woven realms where the interplay of sound and story redefines how we experience and construct reality. Newsom emerges as a weaver of w{a|h}/{o}{l|Il}os{o}ph{e|ent}ric realities, her music a loom spinning the threads of the human condition into an infinite, recursive fabric.
