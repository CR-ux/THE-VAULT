I try to remember 
my brain is two people 
A scared 
A scared child 
and Mother 

One year old 
One month old 
One day old 
One day
 
I came to London 

One year 
One month 
One day
I came 
I came to London 
and you came back 
sobbed into the vastness 
of your chest 
Smelled every second 
we spent 
In the beads of your beautiful sweat 

You Pissed in my hotel bathroom 
Not wanting to flush 
The closest I could get to you 
away 

Push away 
the ones with hands that are big enough
 to sleep inside of 
 away are 
the ones i held onto 

my fishnets snagged 
On the sleeve of your jacket 
The line too slack to reel you back in 
And there you left a hole 
where I walk 

Time’s circumference 
Time 
Circumference 
expands, opposing 
Space between your heart and mine 
Zeno had a field day making me 
Hero of a villain story 
Men take their way with me 
The Men rush in and leave the room empty 

The men rush past and into lines 
Line 
Plane 
Dot 
Lie 
Play 
Cot 



Plane, line, point 
Plain, lie, dot 
Another plane to a home that’s not 
face so hot with tears and snot 



I’m done being the strongest girl you know 
Just let me sink into the weakness you built for me 

Relieved somehow 

My god 
None of it makes any sense 
It is a blessing 
My god
My god
None of this makes any sense 
My god 
It is a blessing 
To have felt 

My god 
It is a blessing 
To feel 
The same air 
That kissed your skin 
My god
It is a blessing 
To have kissed you 
Before you left 
My god
It is a blessing 
My god 
I was blessed 
To have met you 
To have felt 

Being here now 
Is talking to god 
So have some respect 
Being in this body 
Is talking to his 
So have some respect 
Being Now 
Not fighting or thinking 
Just feeling it all 
Listening 
Is talking to god
So have 
Some god 
Damn 
Respect 
And hear 
The here and now
Uncircumspect
