permalink: Kitchen table quandary CTRL+ALT+DEL
---
G, Bm, Em / C
Where were you 
When I needed you 
No longer believe in truth 
With a hospital window view 
{I waited for you}
To be 
Next to me 
To be 
Holding me 
Now I see 
Cold coffee 
At the kitchen 
Table quandary 
[waltz]
With baited breath they wait for a guilty plea  
Last request’s weight on my chest crushing me 
Making Grave Stones of the best of my dreams 
For the sake of you waking from a restful sleep 
[waltz]
In the end, friends love you less than they seem 
A faithful gate leap to take fate for the team 
But push comes to kick and you’re slipping downstream 
Alone on your birthday and swept out to sea 
[waltz]
Losing control of my truth (alt motif) 
Altered the way i saw you 
Deleted shelter mouth roof 
Extricated rotten tooth 
(Am asc)
When the work of my body has been done for me 
In the dark a new spark of an old heart dies silently 
a stitch in the gum is worth two in the heart 
Indelible red thread of bed spread just tears us apart 
[waltz]

(Abrasive vocal) 
Losing control of her dues 
Alternate girl waits for you 
Deleted memories all come unglued 
Print out a warning of what to eschew 
(Instrumental)
(Bm, D, Em, G)
must I be the one to untangle these knots you left 
straightening out all the lines of the all the lies you kept 
Telling by telling me nothing of much consequence 
Emptied bereft and regretting in such ignorance 

Amaj7, G, D
With a hospital window view 
G, Em, C 
I waited for you 

To be 

(G, Bm, Em/C)
Next to me 
To be 
Holding me 
Now I see 
Cold coffee 
At the kitchen 
Table quandary 

(Am ascending to D)
Can’t seem to see how this just cannot serve me 
Didn’t deserve how you didn’t deserve me
Wood has made way for these trees of uncertainty
That Won’t have grown fruit by the time I reach thirty 
Two 

By 
Two 

Animals 
Move in twos 

Scavenging 
Breadcrumbs 
Of 
You 

Sustained on the 
Crumbs 
Of you 

Holding control of the truth 
Altercation is making me lose 
Deleting pleasant memories of you 
And all the love that I thought I knew 

(Staccato)
I am so sick of these solitary odysseys in which I have to reach 
The peak of these mountainous lessons that the turning earth’s yearning words have to patronisingly teach 
Another turn inward for further work on my body 
When the turn that I earned has been repeatedly seized from me 
[waltz]
Can’t seem to see how this just cannot serve me 
Didn’t deserve all the ways that you hurt me 
All our crossed wires and this faulty Circuitry 
Wouldn’t unearth all the ways you desert me 
All our crossed paths and the wrath you lashed out on me 
Couldn’t surpass the sheer mass of what it meant to be 
Seen
By 
You 
Close 
To 
You 
(Amaj7, C)
Loved By the 
Crumbs 
Of
You
Sustained 
on the 
Crumbs 
Of 
You 
G, BM, Em 
Given up waiting for you 
Whittled down rock of the truth 
Holding a hard Place in queue 
My turn a cross threaded screw 

Down on my hands 
And knees 
Sweeping up pieces of me 
Brushing the dust of my needs 
Under the kitchen 
Table quandary 






{At home my bed is even wider 
Returning to thoughts of the spider 
Spinning these orbs as a little reminder 
The home that we built is the most fragile structure}

{Well I guess I have become one of your excellent machines 
Churning up my broken heart and dreams 
To turn them into something we could use 
To give you an alternative that you will never choose}
