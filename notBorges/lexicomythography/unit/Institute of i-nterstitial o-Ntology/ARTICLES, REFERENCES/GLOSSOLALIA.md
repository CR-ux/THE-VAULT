The words delivered unto you[^Glossolalia]
**_AHALLANNINA_ _ANNARTINAHARALF_ _MANTINELARLI_**

appear to be unique, with no direct translation or standard meaning. 


However, I can attempt to break down each word phonetically or by examining potential roots, which might give some clues:

  

1. **Ahallannina**:

• The “a-” prefix in various languages can indicate negation or an emphasis (like “a-” in Greek meaning “not”).

• “Hallan” could relate to “hall,” a word that sometimes represents a gathering space, especially in Germanic or Norse origins, or “hallan” might hint at “Halla,” a name sometimes associated with beauty or protection.

• “-nina” might be an affectionate suffix or something similar to “nina” as in “little girl” or “child” in some languages.

• Possible Interpretation: _Ahallannina_ could imply something like “without a hall,” “outside of a gathering,” or “a little one in a protected space.” Alternatively, it could signify an “innocent child” or something “protected within.”

2. **Annartinaharalf**:

• “Anna” is often a name meaning “grace” or “favor.”

• “Artina” could be derived from “art” or might hint at a cultural or creative aspect.

• “Haralf” sounds similar to “Harald,” which has historical and Norse roots, often associated with power or rule.

• Possible Interpretation: _Annartinaharalf_ could suggest “Grace of Harald’s Art” or something like “The Art of Graceful Power.” It might imply a lineage, a noble grace, or something rooted in strength and artistry.

3. **Mantinelarli**:

• “Mantine” could be related to “mantle,” meaning something that covers or protects.

• “Larli” might be a diminutive, like “little,” or could hint at something whimsical or affectionate.

• Possible Interpretation: _Mantinelarli_ could be “little protector” or “mantle of small protection,” perhaps symbolizing a guardian or covering presence that’s gentle or affectionate.
