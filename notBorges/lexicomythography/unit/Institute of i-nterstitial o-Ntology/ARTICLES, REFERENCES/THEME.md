**Theme** | _noun_ | \ˈthēm [^L]

  

1. **Primary Melody**:

The principal melodic idea of a piece of music, which serves as the recurring foundation or “subject” of the composition. Each repetition of the theme, whether in its original form or as a _variation_, reinforces the core musical identity, even as the theme itself shifts across movements.

• _i.e._: “A theme in music is the main melody or idea that drives a piece of music. It’s usually recognizable and familiar, and is often repeated and reworked throughout the composition.”

• _i.\[i.e.]e._: “A theme is a piece of music that repeatedly recurs as the central idea, with variations on the theme that reinforce the primary melody of the theme itself. i.e., a theme in music is a melodic structure that reappears, creating recursive variations based on the same core melodic structure of the theme.”

2. **Motif or Idea in Literature and Art**:

An underlying concept, message, or recurring subject that pervades a work, creating coherence and driving the narrative forward. In literary and artistic works, a theme often manifests in diverse forms—motifs, symbols, and narrative devices—each one echoing the central idea but shifting to adapt to different contexts within the same work.

• _i.e._: “In _A Series of Unfortunate Events_, themes of misfortune and resilience recur throughout the series, with the Baudelaire orphans repeatedly facing dire circumstances that echo the theme of perseverance amidst hardship. Each book presents variations on this theme as they encounter new villains and challenges, reinforcing the cycle of loss and survival.”

• _i.\[i.e.]e._: “In literature, a theme is an idea that recurs within the text, adapted in various ways to explore different facets of the theme itself, i.e., a theme is a recurring concept expressed through variations that embody the core thematic idea of the theme.”

3. **Theme Song in Media** (_e.g.,_ _Streaming Services_**):

A piece of music often recurring at the beginning and end of each episode of a television or streaming series, reflecting the primary theme of the narrative, which is based on recurring storylines or events. “In the Netflix* series _A Series of Unfortunate Events_ (foreshadowed in the musical staves printed within additional material such as _An Unauthorised Autobiography_ supporting the main narrative in the books), the theme song plays at both the beginning and end\[^p] of each episode, reiterating the series’ central idea—a pattern of unfortunate events that the Baudelaire children repeatedly encounter, escape, and face again. This theme song underscores the story’s recursive cycle of tragedy and resilience, each iteration overwriting and begetting previous events in a seemingly endless pattern of misfortune.”

• _i.e._: “In this series, the theme song acts as both a structural bookend and a narrative reminder of the cyclical nature of the story’s ‘unfortunate events.’”

• _i.\[i.e.]e._: “A theme song in a series acts as a recurring musical piece, bookending each episode and reinforcing the theme of the series itself, i.e., a theme song recurs to convey the recurring essence of the thematic events within the narrative of the theme itself.”

• _Footnote_: **Netflix*** is a _streaming_* service.

• _Further note_: **Streaming** is “a word which here may mean a modality of experiencing music or media, a cycle like that of water returning to the sea to become sky to become rain or tears streaming down the face of a human or animal subjected to cruelty for products like ‘no-tear’ shampoos in a deeply unfortunate series of events.”

• _Extended note_: **Service*** “does not necessarily imply a ‘greater good’ but may imply service in reverence of a power.”

4. **Theme and Variations in Music** (_Music Theory_):

A musical form where the primary melody (theme) is stated at the outset and then followed by one or more _variations_—altered renditions that reflect the core structure while introducing rhythmic, harmonic, or melodic changes. Each variation explores new aspects of the initial theme, adding complexity or simplification, inversion, or extension, all while preserving the foundational melody.

• _i.e._: “_Beethoven’s Diabelli Variations_ present a theme that undergoes a series of transformations, each variation casting the original melody in a new light.”

• _i.\[i.e.]e._: “A theme and variations is a musical form based on a theme, which repeatedly returns in different forms as variations on the theme, i.e., a theme and variations structure is a set of transformations based on the core thematic structure of the theme itself.”

5. **Thematic Development in Personal Experience** (_Psychology/Philosophy_):

The underlying pattern or recurring structure of thoughts, emotions, and experiences that shapes one’s perspective or response over time. In psychological or philosophical contexts, themes refer to the foundational motifs in an individual’s life—such as patterns of attachment, trauma, or self-reflection—that recur, forming a cyclical narrative within which variations unfold in different relationships and contexts.

• _i.e._: “A recurring theme of abandonment may cause a person to react strongly to perceived rejection, revisiting past experiences and repeating variations of the original wound in new relationships.”

• _i.\[i.e.]e._: “A psychological theme is a pattern of experiences that recurs, taking on variations based on the original theme in different aspects of life, i.e., a psychological theme is a repeating experience that reshapes itself, echoing the core thematic experiences of the theme itself.”
