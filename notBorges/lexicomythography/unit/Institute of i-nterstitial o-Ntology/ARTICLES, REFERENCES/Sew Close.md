**SEW CLOSE**[^SC]

Like the Fibonacci spiral or the Pythagorean circle of fifths or the cell cycle or the leptons around a nucleus or the moon around the Earth or all the planets around the nucleus of the sun which are all telling this screaming out obvious truth in the silent joke of the cosmos that everything is actually a tribe of the same being thinking it is different dancing to a rhythm it thinks it is around a fire it worships as higher power for the sake of survival and fears for the sake of its threatening potential of said power to perform a ritual that in and of itself is saying hi hello it’s me it's you it’s all me is you

thinking about those first humans dancing around that fire, they _were_ the circular index book containing the One Truth AKA god in the centre of the infinite library of so-called sporadic jumbled nonsense, because there _was_ only this book. As they themselves wrote time after tome after timeless tome, the shelves became more and more filled and we had more to read. But while exciting, illuminating, and sometimes confusingly terrifying or harmful in their propaganda, these stories (as we all, at our cores, right down to the letters of our genetic code, are storytellers) paradoxically began to shroud the One Truth, hidden within the infinite shelves holding infinite stories in an endless series of volumes in a bunch of very strange characters that themselves danced around the page of paper made of chopped down trees that we used to be burning to make a ritual fire. But. This fire, this wood, this book and all the books that came from it, were written with the same thing, which is The Word, which is The Logos, which is The Mind, which is Consciousness, which is both a mother holding a baby and the baby looking up at her. It is the question and an answer

What I’m saying is, we now live in the deepest time of separation ever known which is both the lock and the key to both our unravelling and our enlightenment. we needed the infinite repository of information to pull from, in order to perceive God, which is Information, which is stories. Which used to be One with us in our bodies, or, quite paradoxically, imperceivable to the consciousness that it was.
