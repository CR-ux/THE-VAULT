# Dream Journal 15.02.2022

I pissed in a rectangular bottle (with ribbons and charms attached) in the corner of an alleyway, and handed it to Eden
I woke up and thought I’d peed in {Bertrand}’s bed  
{Bertrand} and I were in a very old house, along with many of our friends
There was an old lady dying of Covid in the room next door and we were trying to be quiet 
I pulled off my own fingernail on purpose
