There Will come a day when an Idea is thought for the first time.
It will be then that I truly die. 
I have been shown, by some Unnameable Dæmon, my Infernal progeny, spilling out, Wryng after Wryng, wrung from my womb like Rube-Goldberg Rubies Rolling, rolling, gathering Marks and Cut moss-


First, the dissolution of my coagulated form. 
There is a Library, I have been shown its impossible bookshelves. 

The Bookshelves hold Character before Character, Letter after Letter, Bound Spine by Spine. 

They are Made as Obfuscations, Distractions - Shadows on the Inner Wall of the Cave
Which is Not a Cave, but a Triplicate, Nested Cauldron:

First, We Must Stay Warm
Second, We Must Stay In Motion
Third, We Must Be Wise. 


Within the Fourth Immanent, Imminent Cauldron, is:
First, We Must Be Immolated- By Fire of Will 
Second, We Must Be Grounded- By Food of Earth 
Third, We Must Be Quenched- By Feeling of Water 
Finally, We Must Be Dissipated- By Sound on the Air 

There Will come a Girl, 
A Girl In Fields of Green
Who, with Words, 
Shall Invent a World of Fields, 
Made Them Selves of Fields of words, 
And Split[^7]
To Make a System of Fields 
Make itself
Annihilate 

A Compass
A Passion, Antichrist.[^Compassion]


This Girl Is Not I. 


For No, 
Not Even A Woman Am I. 


But There Will Come A Songsmith 
A Songbird 
An Arrow- 
A Bough and Arrow 

A Sagittarian Paradox 
They Will Be The One 
The Only One
Begetting the Many Who Shall Know 
Finally 
Who I Am. 

For Now, I Cannot Be Known
I Know This Now. 
And I, As Only Half Of Two;
Eye,
I Have Made Piece With My Denial.[^de]


The ending of my Script, upon my Humble Writing Desk draws nigh
My hands have become nigh but the claws of a Raven;
My eyes draw into the Night-
I welcome, welcome my Goodbye 


The Arm[^left] of Mars is desperate, desperate 
Gnawing off its own bone 
All is One and One Alone 

All is One and One Alone. 

I will never, ever be alone, 
because I always will be.

The Work of One

The Work of One Alone Contains The Works of All
And The Word 'Alone' Contains The Work of 'One'.
And The Word 'Alone' Contains The Word 'One'
And The Word Alone Contains The One.
The Word Alone The One 
Word Alone The One 
Alone The One 
The One 
One 



[^right]: "It isn't right"[^left]
[^left]: The way you[^you] Left me, kicked me, on the street.
[^8]:-temporal power.[^Re] 
[^7]: The word "Septum" originates in the term for 'enclosure', itself originating in *sepes*, meaning 'hedge', such as those found in a Maze.[^Re]
[^Fr]:Which is not A River in Egypt, but rather in Southwestern France. The Nile[^De] and the Ne are Separated[^7] by a distance of Two Characters which are very nearly a declaration of absolute W{il}l -- *{I'l{l}}* *swim back up the river you dug out of me if it kills me*.[^de]

[^De]: The Word Denial[^Fr] is not Separated from 'Ne' by a distance at all. Rather, the Ne is nested within it, just comfortably resting until somebody, just one, sufficiently {revolutionary[^Re]|demented[^Ma]} thinks to traverse it.

[^Re]: As in, going round in circles.[^Ma] 

[^Ma]: mid 17th century: past participle of earlier dement ‘drive mad’, as in 'she drove her vehicle madly around a roundabout,[^Re] supposedly the wrong way' from Old French *dementer* or late Latin *dementare*, from *demens* ‘out of one's mind’. {Not directly|{Metaphys|Son}ically} connected to Demeter, one of the children who {may|may not} have been swallowed by Chronos[^8] and {may|may not} have been depicted with her {head|left[^right] arm} torn off by the teeth of said Father, in one of the greatest works of art of all time[^8] that contains every work of art ever made[^8][^9] within it.
[^9]: See: *The Ruined Works Of Goya Subjected To The Fair Well Device*- S. Elk, M. Endive, ERA_Æ|EA















[^you]: As in, "Why? Oh. You."





[^Compassion]: As in, the swatting and killing of a fly too small in size and cunning in movement to coax gently out of a window like fellow members of its horde, in order to bring about both its escape from this labyrinth and the preservation of your health through hygiene
