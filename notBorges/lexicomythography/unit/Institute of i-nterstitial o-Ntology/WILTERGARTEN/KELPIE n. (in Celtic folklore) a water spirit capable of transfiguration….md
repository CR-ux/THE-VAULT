KELPIE n. (in Celtic folklore) a water spirit capable of transfiguration, usually having the form of a horse, reputed to cause drownings or to warn those in danger of drowning.

Underwater 
weight of spotlight 
Shining into solitude 
The kelpie cries: 
‘I wish to take the form 
of a woman’

She begs to shake her demon skin
Calling ships with rotting wood
To raise their tattered masts 
As if the butchered homecoming
Might bring about forgetting
The ache within her cloven hooves

Drowning men 
In closing walls 
of noise, in love
Alluring them to early death
Reaching for a hand, a heart - 
And severing their fingers. 

She tries to take the form 
Of a woman
or bring a little wave 
of life in 
to Be
III of them:

[[BORN TO BE THE SKY]]
