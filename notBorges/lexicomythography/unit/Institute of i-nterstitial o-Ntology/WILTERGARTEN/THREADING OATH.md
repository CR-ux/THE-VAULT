I do not want to be a sinner
I know the divine is rapt in letting go
I know the sinning is the seeing Sin:
Unpicking stitch so Light within
I do not want to be the winner

Siloed—I give mine, am rid, my debt ingrown
The thread of winning is ravelled Thin
Braying: Now*, the mighty din

I yearn not to be a sinner,
For Divinity within bestow,
In weaving Sin, in vision dimmer,
An Ordained Weight on Light below.

Seek I not to be a victor,
Herein lies my burden sewn,
I understand that to coil Thinner,
Is to twist in din alone.
