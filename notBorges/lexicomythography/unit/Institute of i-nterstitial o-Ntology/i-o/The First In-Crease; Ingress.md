INT. TENEMENT FLAT- SOMEWHERE IN GLASGOW

An adorably deranged-looking person sits impossibly cross legged amidst piles of sheet music towering over them, face half-illuminated by candlelight, ONE EYE cast in shadow. Their black hair is matted and half-tied up with a YELLOW BOW, becoming less-and-less tied up with every page read. They are humming a tune that sounds decidedly atonal. This is XENO. As their humming becomes more emphatic, their breath inadvertently blows out their candle. Darkness falls upon the scene, and an almost imperceptible figure is seen, just for a moment, touching XENO's shoulder, who either doesn't seem to notice, or care.

XENO
(sighs in exasperation, striking a match a considerable distance away from the precious manuscript)

ZOOM IN on the flame, as XENO carefully moves it toward the candle, lighting up the room once more. The shadowy figure disappears as XENO flicks their wrist, extinguishing the MATCH


MATCH CUT TO:


INT. NARROW CAVE. DESATURATED - LOCATION UNKNOWN 

CLOSE UP: a candle's flame. A similar, seemingly pitchy, hum can be heard, only coming from a much coarser throat. 

RACK FOCUS TO:

A decrepit, androgynous figure, inside a small cave, face half-illuminated by candlelight, ONE EYE (the opposite to XENO) cast in shadow. They have barely any hair left, revealing the same symbols as those on the cave walls, carved onto their scalp, seeming to dance in the flicker of the candle's eerie glow. They are writing with a sharpened animal bone onto a piece of goat vellum in what appears to be their own blood. The manuscript vellum sports just as much dwindling hair as the scribe. This is WILTERGARTEN.


OVER WILTERGARTEN'S RIGHT SHOULDER, focus flickering between a still-healing, intricately carved scar, and the manuscript, which is now seen to hold a strangely complex series of musical staves. WILTERGARTEN appears to be humming along with every note inscribed with their LEFT HAND. Their quill runs dry, and they fall silent, moving their LEFT HAND to their RIGHT SHOULDER, wincing as they pierce the layer of granulation tissue like a repulsive creme brûlée, as we see that they have been replenishing their 'ink' with each CUT--

CUT TO:

INT. BACK (FORWARD) AT XENO'S FLAT 

XENO is scratching their RIGHT SHOULDER using their LEFT HAND. 

RACK FOCUS TO:

A pile of dirty dishes in the foreground blocks our view of XENO. PAN to a PAN that still has a congealed, half-fried egg in its centre. ZOOM in on the YOLK, a Pale Yellow matching that of the discarded MATCH--

MATCH CUT TO:

INT. INT. BACK OF WILTERGARTEN'S EYE 

MICROSCOPIC LENS slowly moves through WILTERGARTEN'S orbital LENS, piercing through the veil of WILTERGARTEN'S Cornea, which is clearly succumbing to a Pale Yellow CATARACT. FISHEYE WIDE SHOT of the CATACOMB, with apparently no entrance or exit in sight. Carved with the same TWENTY THREE SYMBOLS and what appears to be a likeness of the god PAN. PAN across its internal curvature shaped like a FISH BOWL, or the shape of an unlit MATCH-

MATCH CUT TO:

INT. FORWARD TO XENO'S FLAT 

A half-empty fishbowl sits next to the dirty dishes, mildew forming at its edges, the shape resembling the internal surface of WILTERGARTEN'S cave, or that of an EYE. The mangled corpse of a DROSOPHILA, seemingly crumpled and folded in on itself, floats in the shallow pond, circling in a posthumous *Waltz Macabre*. Another DROSOPHILA lands on the rim of the fishbowl, seeming to peer in upon its late contemporary and heed the warning, quickly flying away.

TRACK the DROSOPHILA toward XENO's EYE (the opposite to WILTERGARTEN'S)

XENO
(wincing in disgust, they attempt to swat the DROSOPHILA with the closest book they find, which happens to be one of their Mother's on the Celtic resonance of the god PAN)

PAN to the image of PAN on the book's cover, now haphazardly thrown on top of the PAN next to the FISH BOWL. The DROSOPHILA, still alive, lands on top of PAN's EYE - the only one visible in the image.

XENO
(sighing, seemingly in remorse)
Sorry buddy. I didn't mean it. We're on the same team, really. 

PTSD FLASHBACK TO:

A dimly lit Lab-turned-operating theatre. A single XENON Floodlight (circular) casts an egregiously non-autism friendly florescence on a TEN year old XENO, then known as PERIGEE, lying on a gurney, hair down, but yellow ribbon being nervously fidgeted with in their non-IV bound hand.

PERIGEE 
Why, Daddy?

MYO
(injecting XENON-based anaesthesia)
Shush now glimmer, promise you won't feel a thing, I've *seen* it. Now be a good Egg and count to Ten for me-

XENO POV: Their EYEs gloss over as their head lops to one side, their gaze resting for a moment on a jar of imprisoned DROSOPHILA, awaiting MYO's optogenetic analysis. Their vision blurs to unconsciousness. TRACK the only DROSOPHILA not flying in the enclosed space, but instead walking on the glass, appearing to point with its proboscis at the SIX Eppendorf tubes adjacent to the jar, labelled RHODOPSIN 1-6

PERIGEE
(The Child who was Older, sheepishly)
One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Si--

XENO ^
(The Adult who is Younger, rhythmically)
ONE, Two-Three, TWO, Two-Three, THREE, Two-Thr--



FLORESCENT WHITE OUT TO:

INT. BACK, FORWARD TO AN ORCHESTRAL HALL

XENO
(conducting with their LEFT HAND, violently, sweat visibly flicking from their sodden YELLOW BOW with each passionate shake of their head, as they play the prepared piano with their RIGHT. Crocodile clips strangle each of the piano strings, the wires all controlling the eye and proboscis movements of a gargantuan Robotic Fruit-fly hanging above the audience- all of whom are sporting 'Opera Monocles', Augmented Reality hardware which makes the Drosophila appear to be birthing swarm after swarm of smaller, identical progeny, flying in murmurations that mirror the composition. None of the audience are watching XENO or the orchestra, but are all horrified and captivated by the holographic swarm above them. As the coda draws to a close, the DROSOPHILA swarm begin to drop upon the audience like, well, flies. Shrieks and gasps of disgust and horrified delight can be heard over the now-dwindling orchestra, which dies out section by section, in tandem with the short-lived pseudoInsects. )

TRACK the one DROSOPHILA left alive from the swarm to XENO's LEFT HAND as they swiftly close it into a tight fist, signalling the end of the performance to the players, and seemingly squashing the holographic visage of fleeting life. The music comes to an abrupt halt with the visibly exhausted XENO hunched over, barely breathing, but immediately looking over to the back row of the string section, at the only instrument they'd really been hearing-

FIRST DOUBLE BASS PLAYER
(smirking, he at first seems to be waving his bow at XENO, but upon closer inspection, he is simply scratching his nose and flirting with the cellist to his right)

XENO
(staring through the F-holes of the Bass, through the Body of the Bass, through the Body of the Bassist and through the bricks of the concert hall and out, out, out into the opener air, away from all this deafening silence-)

AUDIENCE
(At first tentative, then, gradually, as a waterfall remembering its purpose, thunderously applauding)


COMPÈRE
(running onstage, pointing at XENO)
MÆSTRO X EVERY BODY! 
(COMPÈRE applauds clumsily into the handheld microphone, providing an ugly punctuation to the audience's, reminding XENO of their obligation, as the rocks at the bottom of a waterfall are eventually reminded of their fate, to erode, and fade back into the water they once resisted)
XENO
(standing to the audience's Yelling, they bow, the YELLOW BOW falling from their hair, now heavy and drenched in the lubrication of sweat)

TRACK the YELLOW BOW to the floor in SLOW MOTION as the applause slowly fades. 

RACK FOCUS FRO AND TO:

All the orchestral Polycule (including the Bassist) smiling, kissing, and hugging one another in celebration, while XENO, composer, conductor, centre stage and yet entirely alone, reaches down to pick up the YELLOW BOW with ONE HAND. 

YELLOW BOW
(V.O.)
*Bravi, Glimmer
(As the applause fades, so too does the image of XENO's HAND, finger by finger, being overwritten by an entire screen of Yellow, gradually growing paler as if the lingering silence itself is draining the hue)


INT. BACK FORWARD BACK BACK TO XENO'S FLAT

XENO's OTHER HAND appears to pick up the hair-and-scene-tying device. The hand performs the task of wiping the screen clear of yellow, to reveal the previous (chronologically subsequent) locale of their dark and dirty flat. The OTHER HAND is once again reaching down to retrieve the same YELLOW BOW. The BOW is now covered in stains; clearly discoloured and frayed.



XENO
(Tying up their dry hair and peering over to the image of PAN covering the PAN, )

PAN to the DROSOPHILA perched upon the picture of PAN upon the PAN. SUPER ZOOM into one of its EYEs, through its nervous system, lit up with the RGB lighting of genetic markers; As it crawls nearer to the ledge of the book teetering above the PAN, TRACK a single occipital nerve impulse from the EGG to the EYE to the BRAIN, then ZOOM through the fly down through the pages of the Celtic Mythology Text, highlighting key passages on 'Stone Circles of the Hebrides', before piercing the veil of the book and resting, again, upon the congealed Egg inside the PAN - now half illuminated, half covered by the shadow cast by the book.

XENO
(O.S., speaking softly to the DROSOPHILA)
See? I couldn't make an omelette even if I wanted to
