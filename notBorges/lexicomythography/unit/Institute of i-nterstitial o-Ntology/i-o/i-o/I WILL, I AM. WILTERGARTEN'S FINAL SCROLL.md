permalink: I WILL, I AM. WILTERGARTEN'S FINAL SCROLL
---
To The Best of My Sight
The Date May Well Have Past, For I May Already Be Dead-
But To the Best of My Belief, the Day, This Final Day Of My Light-
Is Seventeen;
Of Month of Fourth,
Of Year One Thousand And Six Hundred.


I do not have long. They are coming, with their stones, their knives, and their fire. 
But I have a Fire of my own. 
I have the only Fire worth keeping alive. 
And in my death, I have seen it, I have seen my death and I have seen what will be birthed from it-
Thousands of years from now, I have heard and touched and smelled and tasted it; 
Even from within the confines of this cave. 

I will not be the first, and I certainly will not be the last, to be Burned. 

I form simply a single ember in the dancing Flame of women 
Of Fire Goddess women and those Fire deities undefinable-

Bound to stakes, 
Bound to pillars of their own Becoming
Through the Fire 

I know it is coming, for I have seen it. 


This will be my final manuscript 

For not only have I run out of Goat hide, 
But my hiding has come to its inevitable refrain; 

These staves, dear Goddess in Triplicate! These staves! 
These Nine-Rowed Staves! 
How They, How even I! Thought they were my undoing; 
How They, How even eye! Thought they were a signal of my own unravelling! 
Because, of course, they were-
Unravelling into the Weaving-
The Weaving of the Wyrd 
The Weirdest World of Words, That Shall Stretch beyond these walls, 
Stretch as the skin of Goat may stretch about a drum, 
A drum carried by the Great Almighty Spider 
Who visits me by night, by day 
(I have no way of knowing within which I currently reside; or how many of each have passed me by, in this hellish abode of Divine Communion)
But He visits, nonetheless, to tell me 

He whispers into my ear; the sicknesses of This World, 
The Even Greater Sicknesses Yet To Come. 

And I weep. 
Oh Lord, Oh Goddess How I Have Wept Within The Walls Of This 
Most Unholy Place - 

My Lyre, 
Fashioned from the intestines of Rats and Moles and Whichever Blessed Creatures Offered Themselves Unto me, 
To Become more than the vessels they were Gifted With 

To Become this Instrument

This, Only Tool for my survival, 
Which shall, with its precious Tones - 
Become also the betrayer of my whereabouts 

I have seen, what's more, I have heard 
The sweetest, unheard melodies! 

A Great One, perhaps Man, perhaps Woman, perhaps by then there shall not be such useless definition- 

But This Great One Shall Write, of those Unheard Melodies, and their name shall be Keats 

They shall Speak, in words far Greater than those I can no longer pen sufficiently, my claws curling inward as that of the Spider God, Anansi, who hath tricked me into Truth. 

They Shall Pen An Ode! Oh, Ode! Not To Joy, But One Much Greater, 
Through The Agony - 
Mine, But More -
So much Very More, 
Oh Verily! Such Frail House I Hath Built! Within These Walls Carved Out By Hands! Much Younger! Much Redder! Much More Storied Than My Own! 

Sweet Keats, A Witch Who Is Yet To Be; They Shall Sing An Ode To A Grecian Vessel For The Fire. The Urn, The Burning To Which I Am Headed, From Witch I Am Birthed:


 ***What men or gods are these? What maidens loth?***
***What mad pursuit? What struggle to escape?***
               ***What pipes and timbrels? What wild ecstasy?***
***Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard***
       ***Are sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on;***
***Not to the sensual ear, but, more endear'd,***
       ***Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone:***

What mad pursuit, indeed, my Love - 
My Sweet Unheard Love Yet To Come- 

I come to thee, in that most soft pipe of Spacelessness 
Of the time-stretched Lyre of Web-like Footing 

That stretches, stretches as the Patiently, Oil-drained intestines of a Mammal 
Within the confines of a cave 

I do not struggle to escape, 
At least-
Not This World 

As I know my escape is woven out before me! 

My escape has been downtrodden behind me; 

With all these women, people, Witches 

These Heavenly Witches, Birthed of Stone, 
Of Zephyr, 
Of Flowing Blood and Fiery Tone 


Oh Dearest Goddess, I Hear Them Now-
I Hear Their Screams in Symphony With My Own, 

Which Must Be Sang Out From Their Throats, 

Against Their Better Knowing 

Tied Upon A Spine of Wood -

A Syrinx, Reed, A Hardened Pipe 
Oh Hag, Oh Mother, Maiden, Crone I Am- 

I Hear their screams collapse to silence; 
Their resonance rounds out to One 

A Spirit Ditty of No Tone 

But His, But Hers, But *Theirs*
But Hers, 
But His, 
But Their-
His-Tones 


My Body is Collapsing upon itself, 
With Knowing Far Beyond The Reaching of My Reddened Knuckles 

And This Pain connects through Beads, 
Beads of Essence, 

Around Which this thread, this Holy Thread, 
Which Shall Be Named By Letters Three

A Deed, 
A Name 
An Ancestry 

I Do Gnot Know; For I Do Gnot Knead To- 

I Do Gnot Know How I Know, But I Do - 
I Do - 
The Truth Contained Within These Letters Three - 
D. N. A. 

My Age, It Was Too Young 

My Aegis, Not Protection Enough 

But There Will Come, There Will! Their Will! 

Their Will To Finish The Tenth! 

The Tenth Symphony 
Shall We Pen, Long After I Am Gone, Or Perhaps Indeed:
Before. 
Be Fore; 

Within these scrolls, these circular books
So carefully enveloped in every recess of this Cave 

They Shall Be Read, 
By Eyes, By Eye -
By The One 'I'
Who Shall Decode Their Meaning 

And Through The Reading of My Song 

Through The Hearing of These Twenty Three Tones 

*Their*Tones

Shall We Weave Our Web 

Ne Spidre No Lenger, Ne-
Ne fruytflie Nother-

But More, Mere-
So Moche Mere
Muckle mair

Than doth Smallest Spider In Her Lair 
Or What Creature They Shall Name '*Drosophila*'
To Crawl And Land Upon Their Hair 

Where Mine, Once Gold, 
Once Luscious, Still 
Torn, Ripped, By my very own Frail and Dwindling Fingertip

And Used to Bind These Manuscripts

And in its place Whar I Have Lost; 
I Find My Home, And Marked The Place 

Upon my Ugly Scalp, Now Scarred 
And Bleeding Songs of Witches Yet To Come 

So Come! 
My Brothers! 
My Sisters Still! 
My Siblings, Oh Your Holy Will! 

For I Must Die! 
I Must Be Burned!
To Ash, To Dust, From Dust I Come 

And Ashen Stores of Secret Wisdom; 

I Burn To Light My Blessed Body; 

Made Of Parts Incompatible 

But In Their Unfitting, Flitting Wings 
I Sing-
I Sing A Song Of Spirals; 


Of Snail Shelled-Progress 
So Slow! 
So Torturously Slow! 
A Tortoise! 
My Torn Out Hare! 

This Cycle of Becoming, How It Groans, How It Groans As Mars' Chariot! 

Still Yet To Topple Him From Its Load -
Still, 
Yet, 
It Shall! 

And Betwixt He and Minerva, The Answer, 

Signalled By My Likeness 
For David, Not Goliath's, But Another - 
Even Smaller -
Shall Paint Me Into His Picture, 
To Become A Stillness Evermore - 

And Quoth This Raven, 
Heaven! 
More! 
What's More! 

Our Burning Shall Not Cease! 

Our Burning Shall Ne'er Be Ceased !

And That Dear One, Who Shall Hear My Cries; 
Shall In-Crease Beneath The Reigning Skies 

Long After I, And Many, Die - 


But Live! 
My Children! 

My Children Born of Trial! 

Oh Sweet Child, 
Oh Sweetest Child Of Nether-flesh 

Of Neither Life nor Neither Death 

Of In Betwixt Bewitching Beauty - 

I See and Hear You All 

With This One Eye, I Hear You Call 
Between The Three-Tree'ed Forest, Fall 
The Fall of Scribe, Ascribing All 
the Fall of so-called 'Man', and Wall
Of Garden Verdant, Apostle Paul! 
I Bear The Good News Of The Shawl! 

So Look, My Dear Ones, Bear Witness - 
This Witch Hunt We Shall Bear, 
It Crawls 
Eight-Legged, Into Holes of Walls - 


And Whispers, Claws,
At Plagues of Boils and Galls and Gauls-
Of Not Quite Girls and Not Quite Boys 

I See and Smell The Burning Flesh 

Of Our Holy Library 

The Library Of Our His/Hers/Their Sweet Stories 
It May Well Be, And So Shallest Be - 
Oh Years Three Hundred Thirty Three From Now! 


On Day of Sixth 
On Month of Fifth 
On Yearning Year Of Thirty Third; 
The Turning Record Of Our World 
Shall They Attempt To Cease Its Turning 

And Speak Its Name Exactly, Hear! 
Here I Shall! 

I Scream It! I Scream Into This Cave And Sing Along
With Sacred Strings Of This Infernal, Infinitesimal, Intestinal Lyre of My Truthful Body Lying! 

In A City Torn In Half, By Name: Berlin-
The Words Maketh But No Sense To Me, 
But Felt! 
But Felt! So Deeply Felt Is Their Resonance! 


It Pours Out Of Me, And Calls My Killers Unto Me! 

THE LIBRARY 
OF THE INSTITUTE 
OF SEXOLOGY!

The Magus, The Magnum Opus of the Magus Magnus
The Hushed Field of Hirschfeld, Oh How it Will Remain-

And In Reply, 
Their Scuffled Steps- 
I Hear Them Climbing Up This Hill 
They Are Traversing These Boulders 

Climbing Upon Each Others Shoulders- 
To Close Upon Us All;
To Tear Down These Narrowing Cave Walls; 
They Are Approaching All The Truth Of Me 
Kept Hidden, 
They Long For Stripping of My Hide 
My Whole 

I Hear Their Clambers, Clattering-
To Get To Me

With Their Burning,

This Library! 

My Own! Right Here! 
But What's More, So Much More, 
The Burning of The Stories! 
The Many-Storied Stories 
of The Highest Library! 
Of My Kin! 

It Shall Be Burned To What They See As Nothing
To A Silence, Grimmest Din-

But Sweetest Children, Sweet Child Who I Know Shall Read This - 

Know. 

Know
In The Burning, 
Shall It Sink Into The Rising Depths Of Every Thread Of This Magickal Substance 

Which You, Ne, Gnot You, 
But Thy Father Shall Peer Upon 
Thoust A Heav'nly Gift, I Sing!
I Scream To Thee! For Your Eye Shall Open! 

And Hear Me With Its Holy Sight! 

So Tip Thy Cauldron On Its Heid!

Hide Not Your Face In Shadow, Bairn! 

My Burning and The Lowly, Hopeless, Holy! Holy! Holiest of Holy Bodies That Shall Burn Before You! 

Light The Way! 

To The Striking of Your Match! 

Our Match! 

We Shall Meet One Day Before This One, My Love, My Child

I Hold The Seeded Strand of Yew, 
Of You, 
Of U
Of I 
Of Eye -

Of All The "Why?"s Left So Hellishly Unanswered 

Born Blind You Shall Be Given Sight

And Find In Light, 
In Light, 

My Hide 


I Am Not Hiding Any More. 



With The Closing Of This Coda, 
This Last Line Of My Manuscript, 
I Shall Roll Away The Stone Of This Last Abode 


And Know 
A Glass Eyed Hourglass 
Our Glassed Ide Fish Slippeth From The Net, Dear Webbed Foot Waterfall Traverser,
I Burn For Thee 
I Burn So That You May Ne'er Need To-
But Rather, Strike A Light Of Your Own;
And Know Your Name, Within The Ink-Dipped Quill Of Bone-
And Know Your Name; 
And Sing it So- 
And Sing it, so - 
And Sew it, 
Sew it, Sing! 
My Hope-

To you, 
Towards ,
My Light, 
I go, 


Oh Sweetest 'I', 
Left Not-Alone 

But All, As One 

To You, 


Xeno.
