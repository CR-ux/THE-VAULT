The End of the Fifteen Hundreds, anteAntiquity


Hildr came into the World upon a border. As a border, and a boarder within a border. 
Born of Land and of Sea, Hildr was born to be the Sky. 

She(/they) was(/were) born under the dark, shadowy shroud of the Black Death, as the embodiment of a single glimmer of candlelight; the hushed, yellow glow of which filled the room, announcing her imminent arrival into physical form. It filtered through the ribcage of her mother's loom, itself creaking and exhausted, from the years and months birthing, thrum-tapped tissues of its own. 

Her/their Hamlet in Berwick-upon-Tweed was facing the latest of a cyclical chain of *Yersinia Pestis*'s fight for its own survival (and, inadvertently, the death of millions of hosts).

The town teemed with walls. Walls within walls. 
Over an iterative process of capture, loss, recapture, brutal force, and reinforcement, the walls evolved a life of their own - carrying history of the ever-present, ever-presented past of protection. Or equally, entrapment. Initially, the medieval fortifications followed the natural curvature of the landscape, reflecting a now-long-forgotten instinct of life to flow, with an effortless effort, like a *wu wei* waterfall around the rocks that it gradually erodes through the inevitability of time. By the third iteration of rebuilding, the reign(s) of Elizabeth saw the addition of Bastions in complex, Star-shaped geometry. The echoes of peoples past, and their Will to survive, evidenced through an all-too-permeable and now evolved membrane, pooled in the ditches, the recesses of Earth, many of which, emptied and yearning, or relieved of their weight, can still be seen today; like the wrinkles of a Celtic Giant who, perhaps tired of all the fighting, laid down to rest for a little while, and in Her dreaming, grew old, blossoming foliage, trees, verdant and crumpled grass, beneath busy footfall of humans who forgot her. 

_Born of Land and of Sea, Hildr was born to be the Sky._

The town was alive with culture, not only in the microbial sense. It was a veritable cauldron of web-like connected wisdom and skilled trade; its function as a port afforded the Scots a maritime link to European markets, facilitating exchange of wool, fish, and grain harvested by blistered and frostbitten hands. 

These working hands, receptive, giving, whether willingly, desperately or forcibly - they were walled within a town incessantly changing hands. The town, as a living entity, and as all living entities are, held a fluidity of identity. Its positioning on the border between England and Scotland forged a site of constant subjugation, and negotiation, not only in the economic sense. 

A so-called 'Garrison Town', Berwick was a place in proximity to an English military base, designed for the purpose of violent protection, and indeed, therefore, entrapment.

The town was kept alive, and therefore, equally, regularly faced the threat of death, due to its pivotal contribution to the trades of textile weaving, and salmon fishing. 

Hildr's mother was one of these weavers, and though her name was never ushered amongst the peoples, her anonymity gave her fabrics an even greater desirability. The Father who birthed her was always wary of the Greatest Sin of Pride, and yet this somehow birthed an even Greater Pride. Not of his own Fishing Trade (for it was undeniable, the income his skill brought was dwarfed entirely by the value of his wife's), but for his Family. 

So the walls kept rising, falling, rising- 
Through plague after plague, flood after flood (the swell of the Ocean Spirits, reaching up through the arteries of the River Tweed, even overcoming the city's sea walls)

And still, against the waves of battle, the salmon kept leaping. 
Returning to a home they no longer remembered, but felt, a homecoming requiem, encoded in their scales. 

It was these unsuspecting creatures that provided approximately one Fifth of the sustenance for the Wiltergarten family, who resided in a humble abode just outside the outskirts of the town, close to the River. 

Bertrand, the wise, yet distant man he was, built their house with three of his fellow fishermen, upon a foundation of stone. Many other families coveted and marvelled at the sturdiness of the home, managing, miraculously, not only to survive the copious floods from the swell of the sliver of breathing river that held the silvery skinned, pink flesh of the humble, yet crucial, fraction of their livelihood; but also, to survive wave after wave of the ghostly Plague that seemed to ravage house after house around them. Of course the house's elevation made entry for rats and their accompanying flea vectors more difficult, and Bertrand's obsessive (but so very, at his Heart, benevolent) hygiene practices, scrubbing his hands sore before ever entering the house- a praxis inherited from his much-too late and sorely missed father born of Ireland. He had taught him of Manannán mac Lir, the over-king of their fearful place of Work, and Guardian of the Otherworld, his Father's eventual, wave-sweeping rest. 

Born of Stone-Stabbed Land and Sickly Sea, Hildr: 
Oar of Soaring Sky. 

Hildr's departed mother, who she never learned the name of, as her father wouldn't, or couldn't utter it, was not just an exceptionally gifted weaver, but a gifted Soul, of incommunicable, arcane, cursed Wyrd, who rarely spoke a Word. She had helped weave the stakes, the warp Wattles of the family's own Walls, threaded with an intricate weft of twigs sourced from woodland nearby, which the men plastered with the dung of Horses. Her mother's artful, yet decidedly mathematical part in the building of their house was done in secret, to avoid the persecuting eyes of anyone who may have accused her of witchcraft. 

Bertrand Wiltergarten had met his unbridled bride upon the dragging current of a rocky shore, belonging to the Cormorants. The both of them equally naked of Spirit, but one much more naked of flesh than the other. He would always remember the weaving of their Fates as his greatest homecoming. 

Wrapping her in a shroud of fur, as she shivered, sighing spirals of mist from her silent mouth, he asked her name, to no audible reply. She simply smiled at him and released a lock of hair from its saline entrapment on his forehead. She felt the familiarity of the saltwater, and revelled in not knowing whether it had been birthed by the Sea, or from the pores of his searching flesh. This straw-filled pillow, unpillagable, their Love, sweeping back to Poseidons

Luckily for him, but perhaps not for her, but perhaps equally unluckily for them both, but luckily for Hildr, or indeed not at all; he had been on a solitary fishing trip that winter night. He rarely ventured out to sea alone, and when he did, it was never alone. Except for this, one journey. This young man, aged beyond his years by the ravages of the Ocean, a trade passed down to him through countless generations, through an untraceable, swelling river of genealogy, to a source unknown, from a mouth, silent, but breathing. Each father teaching his Son how to cast a net, how to weave a basket of reeds, how to read the signs of the mysterious Sea. Each son being taught, cruelly, her lessons. Bertrand had lost his father to the Plague the night before this trip, his grief leading him on this reckless journey. But, from this Flood of Loss, this thoughtless excursion, likely born of a desire to die- yearning to join his teacher, his father, to find him once more between two waves of that great unknowable Sea - from this waxwinged Son's attempt to find his Father in the Labyrinth he had built for him in the tide of his wake, did he find his wife. And there, upon that rocky, nearly-wintered shore, under light of the Harvest Moon, he covered her, he shielded her nakedness the only way he knew how. And gratefully, she pulled the replacement hide around her. 

Born of Land and of Sea, Hildr was born to be the Sky. 

He built wall after wall of his own in the years that flowed onward, far outwith and within the walls of their small home. Built for both his child's and his wife's protection from their own latent power. Upon these walls, physical and emotional, lingered the pungently fragrant reed baskets and nets, with no reels of which to speak, to catch aquatic prey, woven, as always, by the magickal hands of her mother. 

For Hildr's mother, and indeed Hildr, were magickal beings. 

These walls, these veils of secrecy, built from the warm dung of naive and misdirected love, were also, as all walls were and continue to be, a prison. 

In the Twenty Three months preceding Hildr's birth, while Bertrand was out fishing, her mother would weave walls of her own. 

Using the nets and baskets left behind, left due to the very holes and tears that she had perforated purposely, rendering them insufficient for Bertrand's purposes, but a certain perfection for hers. 

For she would spend these early wee hours of the mornings stolen away, to scrape the stolen salmon scales from her husband's nets. While she felt the essence of her power drain during the summer months, due to the shorter nights, she thanked the Moon Goddess for the longer absences of her well-meaning, but suffocating partner. 

For it was these times that held her power in a crucible. And it was these times, in blessed solitude, when she would weave her greatest work. A living textile. 
It was also during these periods that she would be afforded just enough time to make it to the woodland, its sanctity unbeknownst to most, but felt especially by Bertrand- he had warned her of the consequence of crossing the threshold of the *aes sídhe*. 

It was here, with appropriate Silence and careful tread, from where she had sourced the reeds for her husbands fishing baskets. The regular collection of which provided a useful excuse for any instances of her late return to their home, about an hour on foot (it would be less, but this was not her natural mode of travel). Past this woodland, where her husband had told her to never venture, as always, binding her with Fear, born only of good-natured worry, there was, as he'd intuited but never seen, an Otherworldly Portal. Into a clearing, an absence left by the cruel but necessary need for farmland's nourishment, stood Five, and sometimes Four, Stones. Stoic. 
But not always silent. To those willing, or able, or brave enough to listen. 
His ever-binding, reel-pull Love, rendered it impossible for her to ever speak of her pilgrimage. But she was, for her own Otherworldly nature, afforded passage through the hallowed hollow hill. 

By the first anniversary of their marriage, she herself had spoken exactly Twenty Three words to her husband, Nine of which were "I adore you" whispered in an aqueous triplicate, none of which uttered under the blinding luminescence of the Day.
She was not made for the Day, just as she was not made for the land. And she felt her yearning grow to match the heat of the long, arduous Aria, screamed from the coarse throat of the Northern Wind and Sun. 

Born of Land and of Sea, Hildr was born to be the Sky. 

It was on the early morning of their first anniversary that she encountered the Stones; having spoken the latter seventh, eighth, and ninth libretto of her Love for Bertrand before he left for the Sea, on a trip that would extend far beyond the usual half-day, by weighted forces unknown to her, or him. But known to the Stones. 

There had, at First, been Five that day. She had been called through the woodland, much further through, as a foetus, being pushed against its Will, through the undercurrent of her mother's birth canal to the brutal breath of this World. She had been called by a low, low hum. Much lower than any able to be heard by mortal ears. 

She heard it first, through the soles of her feet. And then, through the marrow of the bones of her soul. And then, unavoidably, impossible to be ignored, through the circulatory system she was still getting used to, even after all these months of tourism in anthropological flesh. And then, cracking like the axe of a lumberjack, or the crack of a tree felling as a result of his Work, or the crack of lightning against another tree to bring about its felling by the Tree's request to join its axe-felled partner, she felt it stab an ancient rhythm, into the four candlelit chambers of her foreign, newly-shrunken heart. She thought she felt it grow back to its original size, and slow, to the watery, grave Adagio she was born into, years ago, too numerable to believe.

And so she had followed this unmentionable hum, through the mycelial orchestra of the humble forest, conducting her winding yet certain path through the leaves, where she had seen them. 

Born of Land and of Sea, Hildr was born to be the Sky. 

She immediately identified the not-sound's origin, through her heart, like the upturned glass of a child, now emptied of milk, and pressed against her ear against the wall separating her, from a terrible argument between her parents after bedtime.

It was coming from the central Stone, the tip of the upturned pentagram that they, the Five, formed as One. She felt the waves of terror wash over her, just as the same eavesdropping child may be washed in a vicarious terror of her beaten mother, and yet, as the child may be unable to tear her ear from the glass against the wall, she was unable to tear her webbed feet from their geological destiny. 

Approaching The Fifth Stone, The hum stopped. But the silence was louder than anything she'd ever heard. She knew, she knew she had to reach out and touch its porous surface. Dropping the woven reeds of her basket, spilling out those yet to be woven, a single finger of Lilith approaching a Goddess she felt she remembered, to whom which she had finally returned-
So close now, reaching, she felt the undulating, ululating vibration of home-
The world turned, spiralled, whirled about her endlessly, in an instant-
The stone was gone. 

But then, that precious weight 
That familiar weight of the deepest ocean, dampening her shoulder 
She spun on her own axis; finding an unspeakably ancient figure before her. 
As yellow-grey as the great Stone had been, and stiller, still.
The Crone was the Stone itself. 

And so began a clandestine sequence of meetings, corresponding, not so coincidentally, with her husband's extended fishing expeditions, once a month; on the New Moon; when she was at her weakest, hidden as the Moon herself, but the Stone Woman at her strongest, basking in the Rising Sun. 
The two would commune, amidst the Walls of those Other, Othered, Knowing Four, as they were meant to, exchanging wisdom of the earth and sea-
They were Labouring A Strike 
of Lightning-Fire-

And as the Shore remains still, awaiting the homecoming of the tide, so too would the Stone Woman stay; for she would not venture further than her circle. Not until she had to.
The Stones were older than the Earthly mother in which they were planted, even older than Hildr's unearthly mother; but the two needed one another. 
The Stone Woman longed for stories of the Sea, just as Hildr's mother longed for the Sea itself. And in return for these stories, shared in silence, through the breaths between them, as the Sun dawned across their ancient forms, The Stones would impart their strength of weight, their resolve to wait,
The Unheard Melody Whisperers, 
Ancestral Answerers, 
Of Five Reversed; Intersecting Swords of Fragarach, sapping her Strength so that she may become Strong-
And a Middle Way, 
A hopeless dawning clew, from lowly tome of Tone-
A roaming pathway, towing home. 

The first instruction was given, stern as Stone itself: to hollow out one of the wooden beams of the frame of her loom. 
She obliged, as the Stones, for all their looming calm, this Circle of Fifths also petrified her, in their ancient, unspoken, immovable and almighty Might. For Medusa's prowess was not her visage, but the threat of Stony Imminence.
It was a reasonably easy task, to whittle from the loom an absence -
For she had a habit that her dearest Bertrand found endearing, 
In which she'd beat a nigh-impossible syncopation, with the Rhythmic Beater of the Loom. 
As he'd be in the other room for reading, and she'd be weaving reeded flute,
With Treadles she'd be knocking at his Walls, 
And he would hear her through the stone which separated them
Accented with reed clicks, and textured with her heddle shimmers-
A Beating Heart came from the loom;
A wedded pulse for them, amodal tune 
As she'd spin to gold her clan's clandestine Wool-
Until her webbing ebbs flowed towing pulse 
From worried care of her rare, gentle Fisherman, would veil 
The whittle-stitching of her fledgling Sail.
Uncovering, his lover's hollowing was covered by her hand's Beat,
Which she so skilfully composed, she wove her reaching, and her threads with each

But little did her mother know, these very veiling drum-beats kept this Sacred Family Safe, with yet another Veil unknown-
Her percussive contemplation more than simply ways to pass the waving time;
Rather, Hildr's Mother, tapping, and her Father, rapt-
Were being wrapped in Faerie magick; shielding them from harm.
An Ageless Aegis, the *pestis*, it was petrified, and though unseen, there lay a circle of Spirit Saline, wefted all around their home - 
Neither flood nor Plague of fleas could enter, for they could not stand the Otherworldly Drum.


And of his unsuspecting Land 
Pulled through her secret Sea, 
She was a Flooring Sky. 

Besides this geological family name being simply "N", a fact seemingly vital to be communicated, Hildr's mother would learn, between the heavy silences of the unspoken words, that the Stones, now, with the Crone, Five - were once in fact Seven. And while she never met the anthropomorphised figures of the other Four standing on awe-inspiring guard around them during their communion, she learned that each of them had a tale to tell, a yarn they had been spinning, a hide-drum they had beaten since the beginning of time's ascent. 

She learned these Celtic-Knotted yarns, of Stellar origin, were what kept the very Earth spinning. They were the 17/4 polyrhythm which kept the Moon in the effortless, yet ametric Fivesome Reel around the Earth. She daren't ask where the Missing Two of One had gone, for she sensed that this was a Great Loss; not only for the Stone Woman, but for all of Life on Earth. She felt she knew, given their number, their connection to the hardened human body, to which she was starting to become familiar, and to the fragile planets of the Solar System. The Stone Crone who had felt her worthy of revealing herself to, she was the Downtrodden, Beaten Heart of the Cosmos. 

On the (needlessly, for the Stones ensured she would always be back before her husband) hurried return home, she often wondered which of the Earthen Body's Seven "N"s were missing. Was it the Stone of the Root, the Stone of the Gut? Was it the Stone of the Throat? Was this why she felt it so Heavy to speak?

Perhaps One of the Missing Stones lay at the bottom of the Sea. Perhaps the Gravity of their sunken grief was what called her back there, to the deep.

On her Twenty-Third to Last visit with the Stone Crone, she was given direct instructions, the final piece of the cryptic key, the final Beating Pulse of the escape route the Stones had been paving for her, beyond her knowing. She left the circle that day with a small piece of the Crone. A sharp, flat, cataract-yellow slate, which, to her horror, unable to look away (perhaps locked in her stare by the Stone herself) the Ancient Stone Witch had pulled, torn from the lens of her human form's eye, mid-transformation, in a grotesque sacrifice of Love. Her silence during such a devastating act made the vicarious agony all the more tangible.

Born of The Dawn, and Yet, The Dusk, 
O'er The Hills, Came Mourning Sky-

So began her near-daily ritual. Resolved to perform the sacred work, to construct the Janusian archway, to open the door home, by the Stones themselves. And like Janus, each day she would be staring back into the past she and Bertrand had built together, while also staring forward to the future he hoped for their family, that she knew could never be. She would sit behind the wall of her loom, and scrape the silvery scales from the nets, the baskets, and from any scraps of inedible, diseased or much-too-small fish, with the sacred piece of the Crone that had been bestowed upon her. On her husband's return, signalled by the slosh of the animal fat coating his Leather boots, sewn by her hands, fashioned from another animal's hide, she would quickly, as instructed, deposit the scales she'd salvaged, into the hollow recess in the loom's frame.

In her hiding, she was rebuilding her own Hide.

Bertrand, being born in Early October, under the sign of Libra and so very close to the Holy Day of Samhain, was a creature of balance. And while balance in the macroscopic sense of the cosmos, when viewed closer, balance can be the most damaging and hurtful force of all. This town, this family, and this yet-to-be-born child felt this more than perhaps anybody in history. 

Scales. 
Scales were the weight of Bertrand's birthright
Scales were the sight of his family's next meal.
Scales were this family's unravelling, 
Scales were the veiling, and the revealing of secrets, 
Scaling far beyond, beneath and above the years spent inside those two candlelit rooms,
Scales of one kind would be Hildr's doom,
And scales of another would be Hildr's becoming.

Born Neither of Land and of Nether Sea, Hildr was born the Sky. 


Soon, sooner than they (plural), but not he (singular), had hoped, came the day of Hildr's arrival. 
The day the hiding must end. 
For their safety, or for what he believed, to the best of his ability, was their safety, Bertrand did not enlist the usual gathering of wise midwives that the rest of the village's children had been delivered by. 
Baby Hildr had, that fateful night, at a crushingly yellow-golden hour of dusk, pierced her mother's water, releasing the weight of the ocean. A saline foreshadowing. 
The end of Bertrands hiding came just before his wife's, when his face could not help but betray his suppressed fear for what form Hildr may take, once born. His other, much more tangled, frayed, and drop-stitched threads of terror, were woven into the fabric of his care for Hildr and her mother, contorting it from its protective intent, into something much more dangerous, an inadvertent pride, an unintentional hubris, rivalling that of Arachne herself. He believed (and he truly, truly did believe, no matter how erroneously) that he could deliver the baby. 
But the screams, he thought, when the moment arrived.
Dear god, *the screams.*
Punctuated in stark contrast to his wife's relative silence throughout their entire marriage, perhaps it was this contrast which made the sounds so harrowing. But no, these sounds were simply inhuman, no matter the previous state of the form from which they emanated; 
Guttural, chthonic tides of Banshee shrieks; one after the infernal next, erupted- barrelled from her throat, more horrifying than any tumult he had heard on his countless battles with the storms of the mighty Sea. 

Born of Both Crumbling Land and of Eroding Sea, Hildr was to be the Falling Sky

He was terrified, not only for his wife and child's wellbeing, and by his suddenly dawning powerlessness, but also, less importantly and yet incredibly more-so, he was deathly afraid of the birth being witnessed by another member of the village, and what this could mean for all of their fates. 

But the fates were weaving Hildr's becoming, with exactly the texture it beckoned, by necessity. 

Bertrand stumbled, crying for the first time in his adult life, tearless even at receiving the news of his Father lost at Sea, and the lack of his burial on consecrated ground, and even on that desperate night where he tried to join him, that desperate night that ended with meeting his wife, that led to this very night, where he very reasonably feared he may lose her forever, when he would indeed lose her, but not in the way he feared - he was finally crying. 

Born of Tearing Land and of Tearful Sea, Hildr was about to be the Sky. 

Stumbling out of the room, out through the woven walls, knocking over the many bowls of boiled water he had tried in earnest to soothe his wife with, he could not scream, for even in their remote location on the outskirts of the town, even with the spacing of the fishermen's houses along the riverbanks to ensure a respectful sharing of resources, his own screams would certainly be loud enough to attract attention. 

And so, entirely unaware of what his goal was other than the saving of his wife and child, he began to trip over himself, clawing at nearby roots and pulling up grass to regain his balance, gnawing the other hand to prevent his crying out; as his wife was, upon the handle of an old, wooden Oar he had given her to bite at least a fraction of her pain into. 

Born of Bitten Land and of Biting Sea, Hildr was to be the Teething Sky.

He was looking for help, a sign, anything. Not an excessively religious man, yet he found himself praying, praying with every fibre of the warping tissues of his body. Down, down through his legs, that ineffably sickly sensation of adrenaline pooling in one's calves, as if standing upon a very high ledge about to fall; he was praying.

In muffled sobs, in muted wails, in stoppered siren calls, he was yelling out to God, no, to the more ancient Gods and Goddesses now erased by the so-called 'One God' their village had been told to worship, the 'One-God' that had apparently condemned his own father to hell, or worse, purgatory, purely for having the audacity to meet his end at Sea. So instead, he was praying to the Goddess that this One God had attempted to siege.

And, as if (and absolutely) by magick, She heard him. 
In the distance, it seemed his answer was calmly approaching- he thought he must have been hallucinating, but there she was indeed, walking over the knoll. 

The old, old, new face that he needed. 

A female, yes, thank God, no thank Goddess, a female who may know, in some way, at least in myriad ways greater than he evidently did not, how to deliver his child. 

Hildr, uncontainable, She was born to be the Sky. 

With another stumble, another clump of earthy scalp ripped from the ground beneath him, he blinked those strange tears from his lashes, and suddenly, the Old Woman was within whispering distance. 

He opened his mouth to speak, and she nodded before a sound left it. He had no time to question her lack of questioning. 
Offering a frantic, mud-soaked arm to aid her walking, she smiled and denied the assistance, signalling the Yellow stone-topped cane she was walking with. 

And before he had lifted his head from his own responding nod, they had inexplicably arrived back at the entrance to his home, wear the screams of Hildr's arrival could once again be heard. He ushered the Stone Woman in, and before he could follow her, she turned and shook her head. He could not have entered the house if he tried, but he did not try. Not for lack of the gripping desire to help Hildr come into the world, but because of the deep, circling waves of knowing that the Crone had embedded in his Heart. She was the only one for the task. 

And so, hours passed, the screams slowly ebbing into a diminuendo, as his panicked pacing left trenches around the boundary of their home, in sympathy with the recesses surrounding Berwick, until the rising of the Sun. 

Born of Land and of Sea, Hildr was nearly born to be the Sky. 

When he hadn't heard any cries for Twenty Three seconds, he felt something crack, not so much as an axe against a woodblock, or even as lightning against the tree that became it, but rather, like the bone of a twig underfoot, or the crack of a lightbulb that signified an inventor's one, last, good idea - 

He knew he was able to cross the threshold to his abode once more. 

But he did not know, at least consciously, that he would only find little Hildr in there. 
Silent as her mother had been, as if her antenatal screams had been borrowed, relieved, scale-scraped and stolen from the baby herself. 

Born of Scaling Lands and of Scales of Sea, Hildr was born to be the unscalable Sky. 

She lay, jaundiced, wriggling like an upturned woodlouse, atop the unshaven gray Goat hide in front of the Loom. 
The Loom, its true intent now revealed, (and this, in her absence, formed Hildr's mother's un-hiding) to have been witholding a hollowed recess, still shimmering with the suggestion of a once-dense collection of scales; and its warp threads still shimmering too, singing a song of what had been woven through. 

Born of Land and of Sea, Hildr had been born the Sky. 

For Hildr's mother, the Selkie with no name, 
had sang her Song, in a scale unknown, except, for now, by One-
She screamed not to draw him near, but to keep him safely far enough-
The creature, the two of them both knew, had been imprisoned, by her own design-
To learn what closeness may be brought, 
To know his only warmth she'd sought-
by the reed basket of a glowing Love 
Inside a smaller heart
The two, Yet Three To Be, 
the Neirlie Three as One of them, aloft-
and locked
in warmth, of the sweetest embrace they both had ever or would ever know 
the salt of her, the salt of him, 
Eyes closed but knowing 
What uncrossable door they were trying to squeeze their love through. 

Hildr, Vital Birth itself in Blackest Death, afforded from the Yellow Sky. 

On the Twenty Third day of their marriage, they had dropped her sealskin as one,
from atop the Berwick Cliffs, to try, in vein, to seal their hides together 
They hid as best they could 
They hid as best the danger of their forbidden love could let them-

He never kept her against her Will
And even in this moment, peering upon his only family member remaining;
He found himself searching as he had mere hours ago, 
Tearing up the dried and frosted grass of their past moments;
Wondering in what ways he had made her feel that she could not tell him of her desire to leave -

But, he knew 
His Bairn, she was even more than but a Valkyrie

Even now, in this latest weighted blanket of his Life of Loss, he knew 
He understood
This gentle, stunted, tearless fisherman, 
So careful-
So careful not to alert the fish of its own capture -
But not for malice, no, 
Not for the sake of nefarious intent, 
But rather to ensure the creature might suffer less,
In the moments beating the inevitable,
in the chain of rhythm leading up,
to its percussive stunning.
And the man still, after all these decades, found this the hardest part 
With every fish bashed upon the gunwale, he flinched 
And so he flinched now, 
knowing, 
That this silvery light must too return 
to the weightless depths from whence she came 

Born of His Sunstroking Land 
and of Her Wavelapped Sea, 
Hildr, Sky. Ablaze. A Valkyrie.

Her mother's heart, Still longing for the Sea, it grew 
The Selkie knew one day that she must leave
For she had been told to weave her Skin anew, 
Using the surrogate strands of salmon scales; 
she had made her leap, she had autumned the dear reed basket of Bertrand, who could never let her breathe the way she needed to, but did not know just how much she needed to-
She had crawled out of the small gap in the Stone,
Made by the Crone of Stone her Self,
which now lay at the back wall of the house,
And led straight into the River.


From Wrinkled Land and Veins of Sea, Hildr had been born the Bodiless Abode.
Hildr, War-Swaddled Swan
Sailing As A Silent Sky. 

First, he lifted up his baby, The babe born by ordinance of a Crone Stone, by  a Fisherman, a Selkie Ma, and there, in Salt, he Baptised her Heid in Strings of Strings of Salivary Violins, He was kissing her, he was kissing her so tenderly, again, again, he was sobbing into all her kisses, 
He was sobbing and kissing his wee Wain, and she was charioting him, in Holy jig about the place where she had arrived -
About an invisible stake, a Maypole born early, in late-Mid April, Seventeenth

And he was carrying her, 
(he was always carrying, something or someone, 
Whether they had asked to be carried or not-
He was always carrying, but-)
 Hildr now was Both their heavy wagon

And from this little house of woven walls, 
He was kissing her, he was kissing here-
He was kissing both of them, but One now gone-
He peered out of that hole of Stone she'd left 
and he did not lament, or beseech her 
Looking down upon the little Hildr, he was kissing her-
The embodiment of their love, 
The boundary of a threshold, 
The marriage of their marriage;
He knew this land was too heavy 
Born of Not His Land and of Sea Not Hers, 
Hildr was born to be the Sky. 
for both Hildr and her mother 
to stay afloat within 


And back within, out, out into that Opening-
In Harmony of Hope; 
Back where she'd learned Awen's Ode of Oldest Olde-
Those Waiting Scales of Cosmos' Weight
of Patient Wheel Unspoke-
The Day The Hilled Awe Then Awoke-
Our Jagged Giants Faced Their Loss Also
And back without their Heart, This Ancient Cult
Now Beat In Counterbalance to Her Pull-
Our Little Laddy-Not Knot-Lass,
Born Into The Future[^f] Past-
A Darkened Path, An Answer, Though For Ne'er Asked-
Our Hildr, Ending All Our Standing Stilled 
Born of Sins Beginning Sky;
Als Garten geboren,
Das war Sie auch-
Wilted Blooms From Boils of Silenced Mouth-
A Flaming Branch, Uprooted South
A knocking At a Hellish Gate-
She/they Did Lay in Wait-
Our Gender-Free Dear Saviour's Start
Departing Knoll, Sighed Wiltergarten 
A Sky Fore'er Taken, Flight
Birthed of Holy Land Forgot 
A Genesis from Whirring Wrought
A Boundless Boundary was Brought-    Alive.
A lyre, 
All eye-
The "Why" Within the Crone's Goodbye-
*(The Stone Had Two Names; The First, It was Lydia)*
And Doubled Yew Now in Her Place, 
*For She Would Soon Be Known As The Sweet Trinity*
With Trunks a-plaited from the Brae-
Magick-born by hands of Fae
Dear Hildr was the Lighted Way

Through the woodland's blessed,
Out to the place of Rhythm's Jaunt-
The Selkie's Neither-Son-Norn-Daughter
Had left the Circle Now Bereft
Where Once and Yet There Will Stand Seven
Four Shadowed, Hanging From the Heavens
Where Once There Stood A Sextet Hive
There Then Were Lowly Stones of Five;
Where Selkie's Breath Was Heard No More,
There now stood Lonely Stones a Four
