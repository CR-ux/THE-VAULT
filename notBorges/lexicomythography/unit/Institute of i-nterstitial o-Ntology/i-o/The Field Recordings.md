As parents were canonically not allowed in the Grand Hall, Myo gave his wee Perigee one last kiss on their head, being sure to secure their yellow bow, and managed to (at least he thought) hide his tears from Perigee. They of course,  heard the tears forming in his tear ducts, and knew this was simply a sign of immense pride. Also, given their father's FFFs, they realised this probably was a good sign for their coming Results, which allowed them to carry a certain, deserved confidence into the Hall with them, grounded in their usual, deep-listening sense of Humility. 

Entering the space, Perigee was immediately overwhelmed with the sheer volume (in every sense) of the auditory data they were faced with. Given the Hall's Nine-pointed Star, or Enneagram shape, the space was an unusual isolation chamber of resonance. The previous Student was finishing their Examinations, having just reached the Final Central Checkpoint, and as such, all the associated equipment was still ringing out in a symphony of movement. 

This sensory overload being such a common initial hurdle amongst the Students, Perigee's Prime Sage, Professor Hamsa, went to hand Perigee the standard-grade noise cancelling headphones, or 'mufflers', but when taking them off their Phonehook mounted to the concertina zig-zag back wall of the Hall's entrance, She corrected herself, realising the Nine-Exceptionality of the Student that was Perigee. She returned the Grey headphones to their bottom row and reached up to the top row of hooks, where the Yellow mufflers were kept. Given the muffler's incredible efficaciousness, the subsequent misuse of which leading to hallucinations, akin to those experienced in a sensory deprivation tank, there were only Three of these yellow pairs. Perigee had been the only child up to then who hadn't experienced adverse side-effects from their utilisation; which signified, clearly, how much they needed them, and just how much of the world of Sound they were able to absorb. 

Luckily, and unfortunately, for Perigee, the same could not be said for her sense of sight, unlike her father. In fact, Myo himself had performed a genomic screen on Perigee the year prior, and discovered a de novo cluster of highly penetrant mutations to the RHO (Rhodopsin) gene, the harrowing data (which he processed, reprocessed, and processed again, still to the same horrible, unavoidable result) suggesting the underlying cause for Perigee's frequent 'clumsiness' at night and in dimly lit conditions - not just the usual assumed Propriosentia—the neurological Beacon (or neuroBeacon) inherited from their mother—but a nefarious, creeping night-blindness that would inevitably develop into a total loss of peripheral vision as they approached their teenage years.

The previous Student's neuroBeacon was that of Photosentia, the most common nB, so the heavy, burgundy velvet curtains had been drawn down to allow him to concentrate upon the Trials of Examination at hand. However, Sage Hamsa, being aware of Perigee's 'Propriosentia' (actually a rapidly developing case of Retinitis pigmentosa, RP), had signalled the Recordings Adjudicator to raise the curtains, much to Perigee's delight. 

Even then, they delighted in the performance of it all, and deep in the Operatic system of their body, they swore they could hear the honey-sweet applause of an audience awaiting the first notes to be played by a virtuoso. Hamsa delighted in the obvious delight on their face, as the Sunlight flooded in, through the intricate, Stained glass panels of that Star-shaped, Cathedral of the Sacred Culmination of Burgeoning Human Knowledge, and began to kiss where their father had moments ago, the glisten of their freshly-fastened yellow bow almost too bright to look upon. 

Hamsa signalled in SomatoSign (Perigee's primary modality of communication for the first few years of formal education) for them to move to the Starting Checkpoint, at the Centre of the room, which, during Examination season, sported a Hexagonal desk, which from a Bird's Eye view, looked like a Benzene ring. 


Perigee approached the Central Checkpoint. 

"Just looking through your diviagnosis file, Mx. Endive"
Perigee awaited the expected gasp of surprise.
"Woah, I've never seen all Nine before--"
They were exceptionally comfortable with silence - in fact this was often a point of discomfort for those around them. Such is the effect of somebody who doesn't feel the need to fill every space they occupy. On the other hand, the same can be said for the opposite. But as their father would say; extremes aren't something to be afraid of. Enantiodromia (one of their latest Words in their Lexicographic collection  - Pre-Seven years old, they would 'Sound Scrapbook' samples of podcasts, or record parts of Speech spoken by others, to keep a record of these juicy letter-clumps that represented such diverse meaning, even within the same word. Now, in the last two years of finding their voice, they had taken to recording their own words, whether found in books or in the world of Sound.)
Seemingly becoming impatient with waiting for Perigee's response, the N.E.A.R. Cleric reading their file inquired: "so it looks like you've got your pick. Which of the Nine vertices would you like to Initiate with?" - The Cleric waited poised at the terminal, ready to open one of the randomised Problems, according to Perigee's chosen Field.
With no hesitation, they said
"All of them, please"

Again, a look of surprise and a stifled gasp, which Perigee heard in the microscopic shift and salivary movement of the Cleric's epiglottis.
It wasn't against the rules, so to speak, but nobody had even chosen a Field other than the one suggested by their neuroBeacon, let alone more than one simultaneously.
"...Well... Just how would that work, exactly? You aren't a computer--"
Now they deemed it appropriate to speak:
"No, but we all are, really- capable of concurrency, it's just a matter of appropriately multithreading"
Clearly tired with their day of back to back Examinations, the Cleric gave up resisting with a sigh;
"Fine, Endive. Here"
They swiped over the screen in front of them, sending over all Nine Problems of their Field Recordings to solve.
"Thank you, Cleric"
"Sure. Let's see how this works out. If at all"

Even with their Yellow Mufflers, they took three seconds to try and consolidate and process the egregiously intrusive sounds of the clinical machinery in the room, keeping the Examination patients under anaesthesia alive. 

N.B. As reading, and most of our perception of Time itself, is tragically linear, what follows is the closest, non-chronological approximation of Perigee's One Hundred and Twenty Three minutes of their examinations.

I. Pythagorean Arithmetic | Numilumenolægia 
*(Ancestral Mathematics)*

---
>**Problem: Devise a unified algorithm capable of identifying and categorising all possible higher-dimensional polytopes (n-dimensional analogs of polygons and polyhedra) that exist within non-Euclidean geometries, while encoding these forms into a fractal-based numerical system for visual representation and practical application in quantum computing.**

While none of the 'difficult' child's Problems proved particularly 'difficult' to them, this one took the longest. This was mostly because, in their sporadically networked brain, they required the solutions to all the others to be finalised in order to solve this one. 

Time to solution: Twenty Three Minutes.
Score: 1.00/1.00.

II. Aristotlean Causality | Particuticlergæria 
*(Ancestral Physics)* 

---

>**Problem: Prove (or disprove) the existence of a causal bridge between quantum entanglement and macroscopic determinism. Develop a model that traces causality from the quantum to the classical scale without violating locality or free will principles.**

The Vertex of Particuticlergæria (known as Physics in anteAntiquity) was the first place they went, much to the surprise of the Cleric, who thought they would head straight for the Vertex of Imaginætia, da Vinci's Vertex (which was thought to be previously known as 'Art' or 'Creativity' in general). But given the time spent with their parents- being privileged, as their only child, to be let into their nuclear familial secrecy of trans-temporal abilities, they were quite well placed to bring together the 'classical' Physics of anteAntiquity (represented by their mother's Hermetic Memory) and the now primary framework of Quantum Mechanics (at first Perigee was rather confused by the Audio signals erupting from their father, but once able, or deciding, to finally speak, their conversations were particularly enlightening to elucidate what the source of the 'wriggly worm' sounds were, winding out from his solar plexus and all around her).

Time to solution: Seventeen Minutes.
Score: 1.00/1.00.



Trismegistian Alchemy | Geophylogænia 
*(Ancestral Chemistry)*

---


>**Problem: Synthesise a self-sustaining molecular system capable of transmuting atmospheric carbon dioxide into a complex, stable allotrope of Gold (Au) using bio-inspired catalytic pathways and minimal external energy inputs.**

Utilising an Endivean approach, again picked up from the work of their father, not through didactic means but through their obsession Word collection, during the hours spent listening to his fingers typing in the Treehouse lab (of course, every key had a slightly different sound), Perigee combined computational and decidedly ancient (here's where Selena's influence resonated particularly strongly) laboratory methods in order to turn their breath (exhaled into a Conical flask, which they had to request the Sage to obtain from the very dusty back side of the Lab bench's cupboard) into Gold. The flask, a rather humble bit of low-tech gear, sat in the middle of an insectoid arrangement of laser diodes, which they had programmed to emit pulses of light in time with an array of singing bowls that the Grand Hall kept behind the Curtains for announcing the rotation of opponents during the Sacred Matches. Essentially, Perigee utilised the unresolved nature of the Pythagorean comma to 'draw the gold out' of their breath. As with all the other problems, they were exceptionally grateful that they didn't have to 'show their work', because they rarely could. They were much more about Hearing. 

Time: Seventeen Minutes.
Score: 1.00/1.00.


Asclepian Scalpeloathics | Barberchirurgæria 
*(Ancestral Biology)*

---


>**Problem: Synthesise functional cochlear hair cells (cilia) and implant them into the damaged organ of Corti within the cochlea, restoring the patient’s hearing by re-establishing the connection between sound vibrations and neural transmission. The process involves real-time calibration to ensure precise integration and functionality, but the patient will remain sedated. The patient's induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) have been harvested and pre-conditioned for you.**

Perigee could not help but stim the moment they read this problem, it being based around the sensory organ of sound. Besides their obsession with sound, their early discovery of the spiral shape of the Cochlea itself had been a large component of the development of the Primary Sense. After writing the rudimentary programming protocol for the robotic surgical arms to follow, they would come back to check on its progress in between each of the other problems they were solving. Some of the more daring and reckless Sages in the room found themselves laughing, even cheering, as Perigee sprinted around the Grand Hall, their wee legs slipping on the polished mahogany. Running was not looked kindly upon in the Hall, and mindful, purposeful but slow ceremonial walking was somewhat of an unspoken rule. So the more Draconian members of the Educational Clergy were attempting to keep their arms crossed and a disapproving frown on their faces, yet, despite themselves, they were absolutely fascinated by this entirely novel and heretofore unseen method of completing the Examinations. The more lenient and interdisciplinary Sages, particularly Hamsa (who obviously had a rather biased investment in Perigee's success), would stand at the intersections of the Vertices, offering Chalices filled with water, as family members might stand on the sidelines of the mid-point mark of their loved one's marathon. 

Time to solution: Twenty Two Minutes. 
Score: 1.00/1.00.


Cartesian Cognitology | Consciælogia 
*(Ancestral Psychology)*

---

>**Problem: Develop a real-time computational model of consciousness capable of integrating neurochemical fluctuations (e.g. those observed in MercurioSentia) with emergent properties such as creativity, intuition, and moral reasoning. Use the model to stabilise and predict the cognitive and emotional states of a patient undergoing conscious neuropsychological surgery. Mid-surgery, the patient will face an ethical dilemma, and the model must facilitate decision-making while preserving self-awareness and neural stability. All necessary neural data and processing frameworks have been preloaded for you.**

>	**Extra Credit†: name the anteAntiquarian term for this Vertex's neuroBeacon, MercurioSentia, along with their ancient 'treatment guidelines' for what they erroneously pathologised.** 

>		**†will not contribute to your score, but will immediately earn you the Grand Sigil, placing you as this Annual Cycle's Hall Sentinel without the canonical initiation process**

Not only did this Problem's solution flow through without a hitch, Perigee ended up creating a collaborative performance piece with the patient, as part of the ethical dilemma they were faced with, which was a variation of the Trolley problem, that Selena had first read to them as a bedtime story, to take with them into their dreamscapes. 

They also completed the Extra Credit, typing at the Vertex's terminal:
'Long before its integration and recognition as a Gift of empathic resonance, the MercurioSentia neuroBeacon was primarily previously known as Bipolar Disorder, but the 'clinical presentation' was often mistaken for other 'diagnoses' encompassing the multitudinal facets of this neuroBeacon, such as 'Emotional dysregulation', 'Borderline Personality Disorder' (as they typed these words in particular, they had to sympathetically giggle, as they recalled the well-meaning, but fundamentally narrow-minded, scope of the ancient Peoples). Depending on recurrence of 'mania' and 'depression', a pharmacological administration of 'mood stabilisers' such as Lithium (the 'Alchemical Standard' first line of 'treatment' in those times), Lamotrigine, or, before its discovery as a teratogen, Sodium Valproate. Atypical 'antipsychotics' such as Quetiapine were also thought to be effective to treat so called 'mixed' or 'manic episodes', or as an adjunct to maintenance treatment. talking therapies such as CBT and DBT were considered a crucial facet of 'recovery'. Of course these 'therapies' helped the patients suffering very real distress and in many cases psychological agony, but crucially, the problem was not with the organism within the cage, the problem was with the cage - which we now know should have always been, instead, a receptive, holistically integrated framework for understanding. 


Time to solution: Seventeen Minutes.
Score: 1.00/1.00.

N.B. They refused the title of Sentinel. Mumbling (much to the anger of the Oldest Sage) that the Sentinel System was simply an echo of the oppressive aristocracy of anteAntiquity as they handed in their Problems' solutions to the Central Checkpoint. They quickly scurried out of reach and back into the anxiously awaiting arms of Myo before the Sage could protest, of course. 


Comtean Triscetics | Autismæcology 
*(Ancestral Sociology)*

---

>**Problem: Design a proposal for the Consortium of Sociocultural Harmony to implement a holospheric learning program that deepens collective understanding of the roles and experiences of less common orientations, such as heterosexuality, and to account for the potential incidence of what was once known as 'neurotypical' individuals, who, regardless of the lack of supporting evidence in the Journals of A.R.I.A.D.N.E., or indeed any of the AcademiClergical Literature, may well still exist. Your solution should leverage neural empathy technologies or immersive simulations to ensure inclusivity and mutual respect while avoiding reductive categorizations. Prioritise adaptability and resonance with the Consortium’s principles of cultural cohesion.**

As with the other 'Social Science' Vertices, Perigee integrated their solutions into their performance piece, forming the solution to the Imaginætia (Art) Problem. 

Time to solution: Eleven Minutes.
Score: 1.00/1.00.


Allegorical Speleology | Socradiatætia 
*(Ancestral Philosophy)*

---

>**Problem: In the First Module of Paradoxistentialist Studies, The Petallien Allegory of the Caduceus was outlined, which envisions all Life as a fractalline interwoven tapestry of Memory and Meaning, spiralling around a central axis/Hermetic Staff of Metacognition. As introduced in your Secondary Annual Cycle, The sinistral serpent represents Memory, the dextral serpent Meaning, and the central staff embodies the dynamic process of Metacognition, where Memory and Meaning intersect at the so-called 'Gnots' of Paradoxistential Recursion.**
	**Using this framework, argue whether Metacognition is best understood as “making” itself: the act of creation, transmutation, and the bringing forth of the new. Within the allegory, imagine a figure navigating the Caduceus. Does this figure operate purely within the interplay of Memory and Meaning, or does their journey demonstrate an inherent quality of Metacognition as an act of “making”?**

Perigee, throughout their running back and forth across the Grand Hall, had been collecting, as always, samples of ambient sounds, and emitting in a constant stream of their gorgeously unique and microtonal vocalisations, which the Sages (at least partially correctly) assumed were an understandable instance of Stimming, often seen during the examinations in the diverse variations on a theme of whichever neuroBeacon the Student was blessed with in their diviagnosis. What the Sages (except for perhaps Sage Hamsa) didn't know, is that Perigee and their father, in the last three years, had been working on an invention. It wasn't so much a collaboration between them, as it was a passion project of Perigee's which Myo had facilitated, standing back in awe, while simply not understanding "*what the fuck was going on*" to paraphrase his first sentence spoken to their mother, during that fateful, first and final game of *Hivehouse*.

Perigee hadn't, at least consciously, intended for the device to be utilised during their Examinations, and didn't really, as ever, know what the ultimate Goal of their Work was until the exact moment it was unveiled. This could be best understood, as with most of their idiosyncrasies, as a synthesis of their parents' brilliance, integrated into one Alchemical Marriage of an entirely incomprehensible, but wonderful, weirdo. 

The device's name, according to Perigee, was a Resonance Recorder. 
Essentially, it recorded both Memory *and* Meaning. It was fuelled by their Father's Endivean programmatic framework, which would eventually provide a groundbreaking contribution to Newsomnian Gnoeneophysics (a Field yet to be birthed, but to be birthed by Perigee themselves), and sustained by the essence of their Mother's Hermetic Memory, which they had inherited via haploidian epiGnoegenomic means.

Upon reading the Allegorical Speleology Problem (the Field believed to once be known as 'Philosophy'), all of their endless hours of work suddenly 'clicked' into place (with a literal '*click*' within their Brain, that they of course heard).

The device itself was shaped in a Petallien form; like a Caduceus of the ancient Hermes, but wound into a spiral, which itself had a crystalline, nearly Bismuth-esque series of branches jutting out, forming a sort of Mandelbrot Wand. But Perigee hated the term 'Wand'. It made them think of those ancient books written by *She who shall not be named*, which she'd never really enjoyed. 

The Resonance Recorder had both input (i) and output (o) modes; the latter of which she'd never actually tested, so for a while, upon reading the Ancestral Philosophy problem and until the moment of its solving (which she solved in simultaneous parallel with the Ninth Vertex's Problem in the Field of Ancestral Arts) she was nervous that she may cause the manifestation of a black hole, or a wormhole of some kind, obliterating the Grand Hall and perhaps all of Existence as they knew it. 

But, ever the perhaps too reckless daredevil, always far more concerned with Boundary-Annihilating Innovative Ideas than the Regulation of Established Systems for so-called 'Safety', they went ahead with what they sensed in their heart was simply: *"Why, A Good Idea!"*

And with a deep breath in, and a deep breath out (in fact, the exact same out-breath given at the Ancestral Chemistry Vertex, which they used to transmute her exhaled Carbon Dioxide into beautiful gossamer strands of Gold), they set the Resonance Recorder to '(o) mode' for the very first time. 

It didn't so much produce a sound as it did *vacuum* the sound from the room. The Sages, all of them, even and perhaps especially Hamsa, looked around amongst each other in panic; none of them had ever heard (or *unheard*) anything like it before. 

(Perigee really did live up to their mother's encouragement to 'Give 'em Hell'. Those poor, dizzied Sages had to take a good few hours recess after this series of discombobulating events.)

In (o) mode, and with the help of the two patients that they enlisted with an excited wave of the arms (one of whom had now come round from their anaesthesia) the Resonance Recorder began to build a sculpture. 

Time to solution: Four Minutes.
Score: 1.00/1.00.


da Vincian Cosmogony | Imaginætia 
*(Ancestral Arts & Literature)*

---
**Problem: Design a cosmological framework through an original artistic medium (e.g., visual art, literature, or conceptual performance) that embodies the interplay of imagination and reality. Your creation must explore the tension between individual expression and collective meaning-making, reflecting how artistic works function as a bridge between the tangible and intangible. Present a theoretical explanation of your framework and its significance within the broader cultural or metaphysical narrative.**

There was no Extra Credit for this Problem, but Perigee inadvertently ended up fulfilling it anyway. Their solution to the problem was not a theoretical one at all, as requested in the Problem File. It was a Practical Demonstration of Conceptual Cosmology.

The sculpture itself was in a process of self-generative animacy, as Perigee performed a Sacred Dance, learned from their Mother on one of their Pilgrimages to The Four Stones and The Sweet Trinity. 

The sculpture, as Perigee had hoped, and perhaps known, began to resemble the triple-plaited Yew Trees that stood between the Four Duddo Stones. Only it was always in motion, the trees never in one place at any given time, serpentining in tandem with Perigee's movements, and the movements of the two patients, both of which were confused and giggling, one of which from the after effects of the Xenon-based anaesthesia, the other simply from the sheer delight of the experience, which shimmered through not only them, but everyone in the room. Even the most miserable of the Sages. 

The Sculpture appeared similarly, but entirely uniquely to each person that viewed it. It was made of Words, but not just the graphemic, typographical qualities of the Words. It was made of *Meanings* and associated Memories of all the Words that Perigee had collected over her life. These heartbreakingly beautiful, and sometimes deliciously sad Memories and Meanings, intersected, warbled and marbled, with the Memories and Meanings of every person in the room, forming a breathing *glimmer* of prismatic murmuration, like the ineffable rapture of a countably infinite *Richness* of Swallows in flight. Together, as One, and yet, so vitally, so voraciously, so violently, viciously, *Venust* in their paradoxically distinctive and individualised separations. 

Most of the Sages were brought to tears. Hamsa saw her departed Mother, reading her her favourite bedtime story, which, through the all-too frequent process of time's passing and its associated grief, she had entirely forgotten. The Cleric in the Central Checkpoint saw all the words they had been plastered with by their childhood bullies, along with every reclamation of them, in their works of experimental literature they had made during their Postgraduate thesis in creative defiance. Perigee saw all of her Pilgrimages with their mother, all of the lines of code written with their father in the Treehouse, and they saw their yet-to-be-chosen name, written at the very top of the tree, hanging ripe like the Strangest Seed of the most Stunning fruit:

⧖eno.
