the left hand path
In 'The' so-called 'literature', and in pop psychology, there has been a prevalence of splitting the brain and its functions into 'sides'. 

This 'Cultural Topology' or 'Sidedness', pervades every aspect of our existence, as we occupy a net-like dimension, which is simply a flattened projection of the True Reality, woven through everything. 

The two sides of the coin are indeed not the same. But the two sides themselves do not even belong to the same coin. Rather, every single, fantastically unique coin, glimmering with its own stains, and split into supposed dualities that are but a faded reflection of a primal, ancestral duality, now diluted past the point of any useful comparison, are only united in the dancing, whirling spin of the coin toss itself. 

What has seemed to fascinate us is the idea that our neurological activity and nervous, anxious impulses originate from the 'opposite' 'side' to which they end up. This has led to sentiments that have sentenced us to sentences such as: 'The right hemisphere of the brain controls the left hand', and so forth. 

Further, we have also assigned *ideologies* to the hemispheres of the brain, as if they were two opposing Deities of a Pantheon at war with one another, perhaps, or perhaps not, depicted by a French painter in the Neoclassical Era. Even Further (or rather, much less so) to this bisection of the Brain, we have assigned these ideologies to the Spirits that animate it. Dividing human Beings, that's *Beings*, into 'Right-brained' and 'Left-brained' camps. The paradoxical irony of this probably being rooted in the Brain itself attempting to make sense of a scarily unwritable gray, an un-black-and-whiteable mesh of potential threats. 

These 'threats', as we hopefully know by now, are rarely *real* threats, at least to anything except the very frameworks-turned-cages that paint them so.

This probably, in part but not completely, underpins the historical demonisation of trans* / non-binary people as a whole, and in fact, any so-called 'minority' population. Such a 'minority' was once seen in those born with a dominant Left Hand. This is, most likely, in fact where the terms 'Sinister' (from Vulgar, vulgar Latin '*Sinestra*', literally, meaning 'Left') and 'Right' (in its definition as apparently '*Correct*') are derived. 

And consider this.
What it means,
To *Be* 'left'.
Be it alone, 
Be it *out*side, 
Or *in* pieces,
Be it facing a disorienting aftermath, 
Or to be Left with Nothing. 

All of it depends on the *leaving* of something *else.* 
'Leftness' is a state which is entirely relative of the group the Othered object has been subjected to losing. 
And so the same could once have been said for those, painted as painters, exiled as eccentrics, branded as hot-headed artists- The Left Handed Ones. 
They were defined by their relation to the Masses of the so-called 'Right Ones'. The 'Correct' majority. 

All of these Halved-Truths are but echos Left,
Left by survival mechanisms which placed 'us' 'versus' 'them'. 
The phenomenon may (insufficiently) be called 'in-group/out-group psychology', or simply 'i/o'[^ioiology]. 

Of course, the brain, being a part of Us, and Us, being the wet, messy machinating non-machines that we are, exist in a much more nuanced, holistic and non-binary state than this. 

Nevertheless, our biases exist. And they are a Fire which runs through everything, fuelling every single one of our choices. 

And you knew this, when you made this decision. 

The word 'bias' in its adverbial sense comes from Middle French '*biais*', which means 'askew, askance' - as in, to observe something obliquely, tilting one's head to the side, as if asking a question that has already been answered for you. 

In Vulgar Latin (and really, quite vulgar), the connection may be drawn to '*biaxius*', which means "with two axes". This gives the impression of a chariot, perhaps once driven by a God of War,  which has become unbalanced by design of its own engineering, forcing the charioteer, maybe an Aries, out from behind the reigns, perhaps to lay before his Opponent, herself predating astrological assignment but most likely herself also an Aries (though maybe with a Virgo Moon), reaching back, out towards her in desperate plea, of a hind-sighted understanding that He/Himself tragically never afforded to Her, either. 

In antiSomatosemantiqueer Queueing Theory, one of the main Research pillars of Lexicomythography, LHP Bias refers to the propensity of people, when faced with the Kafkaesque machinations of binarised queueing systems, to pick the Left Hand Path (LHP), if their primary mode of written linguistic communication is performed from Left to Right (a modality once thought to be the majority, in languages such as 'English', along with and not limited to, the other aforementioned Vulgarities). One would think it would follow that, given this theoretical framework, a term such as 'RHP Bias' would have been coined in logical balance, to represent the writing and reading directionality of ancient sacred languages such as those that were known as 'Aramaic', 'Arabic', 'Hebrew', 'Azeri', and many others. Alas, no such Research has been conducted thus far. 

In Tantra,  वामाचार, or Vāmācāra, refers not quite to 'left-hand path' exactly, but instead, (when observed from sufficiently a macroscopic or microscopic lens) to the composite meanings of 'pleasant, loveable, agreeable, reverse, vile, base, wicked, inverted, contrary, crooked, beautiful, vomiting' (vāma) and 'conduct, ritual practice, attainment' (Ācāra). As you may or may not be able to see, the beautifully fractalline nature of this sacred language encapsulates its own paradoxes, and therefore, the most ineffable truths. Subsequently, through (well-meaning) dilution of meaning in Western Esotericism, the 'left-hand-path' came to denote a 'dark' sort of ritual magick. But this is less than half of the Story. 

Vāma is essentially a state of meeting the divine through its opposite. It may be insufficiently articulated as 'left-handed-attainment', for we, sadly, no longer have the mystical tongue to describe it. A deeper truth may lie in an alternate etymological derivation: that of vāmā - *Woman.* Sanskrit, for all its shimmering glow of opulent divinity, was originally forbidden to be written by women. So, this 'left-handed-attainment', affording the respect to women that they *deserved*, was simply a movement *against the grout and grain of the oppressive system which bound it*. Which loops, as a demonic tape loop, back to the Middle French *biais*: *Sideways. Askance. Against the Grain.* And here we arrive at the truth within the truth within the lies upon burning ash of lies - 

Everything. Absolutely everything. Contains its opposite. 
And an opposition to oppression is not opposition to Love, it is quite the opposite. Which means it is not opposite at all. 

Those of us Left to forge our own rules, are Righteous by our own Hand. 
And this is a very lonely place to live. Which in itself, is no 'Right' way to live. 
As 'Righteousness' has no place without its opposite.
All sides are fighting a fruitless fight, for a rotting fruit upon a dying branch-

But, as you knew when you chose the Leftmost ramp leading to the rows of tiled, cold, benches, less than half of you dragging your feet sheepishly, like aged lambs to certain slaughter-

We must choose. 
Even if the path has already, tragically, been laid out for us. 

Your feet become heavier. Heavier with every incremental increase in altitude. As if these few mere metres were a mountain; sapping the oxygen from your desperate lungs. 

You see one, 
Two, 
Four and then Five, 
Faces awash with confusion, turning around and uttering their decidedly British, insincere but fundamentally intended-as-polite, "*sorry*"s, as they shuffle, turning sideways to traverse the reversal of the path you continue to walk. 

You are certain that at least half, at the very least half of them must be leaving the building altogether. 
Perhaps they are wiser than you. 
Perhaps they know something you do not. 

And so, again, the crippling choice rears its ugliest of heads.
Not two, No,
We are so far past binaries at this point. 
There are in fact, a trinity of forking paths, no longer before, but after you.
Three. 

The Third decision is clear. 
You may leave the room altogether.
You may stop reading your fate now. 
Perhaps that would be best, to follow example of these Righteous Abstainers -
Who perhaps have read a Sentence you have not quite caught, captured in the Stains of the Grout about you. 

You see that exactly Two of the Five who changed their minds, have indeed left the building altogether. 
So Why Not? You think. 

You may join them, in the opener air - 

You may even embody a *Vāma* within *vāma*, and go back on your original decision. 

And yet,
It is still not too late to join the other three, in realignment with the [[RIGHT HAND PATH]].

Whichever of the Threads, 
Blood Red, and Plaited Three, 
No matter how unjust, 
The dust of Eye so dried with crust,
From tears, leeched fear of trying's rust-
With Trial of Choice, we are but trussed-
From sap to spore to seed, to dust -
It's all we have, this Fateful Lust-
Which precious, sacred stain of life, entrusts 

But no. You think-
I was made to be Left.

Beginning at Xeno's end, in your Sisyphean ascent, you nearly slip on a mysterious sludge of liquid at your feet. Not wanting to hold up the queue of fellow audience members trailing behind you, and only narrowly avoiding the initiation of a domino chain of falls through the line of those in front, you put it out of your mind, with a brief shake of your left shoe.

In a theatrical operation that seems like an eternity of moments strung together by an author riddled with ADHD but paradoxically also entrusted with the creative torch of Autism, you reach your seat on the Left side of the Operating Theatre. 

An awe-striking and harrowing scene is laid before you. 
The artist, not yet present, has recreated what you believe to be an archaic surgical scene. 
A gurney in the centre, surrounded by an orchestra[^Croen1] of microphones. Connected to them, an arachnoid structure of wheels within wheels. There is some sort of translucent, dark ribbon that wraps around the wheels. And cameras. Dear god, the sheer *Volume*[^Croen2] of cameras in the space is decidedly overwhelming. Around half (though of the exact fraction, you cannot be sure) of the cameras point inward to the inner circle, toward the performance space. The other half (or not-quite) point at the audience. Around (but perhaps not exactly) half of this half are directed at you. Or at least, the half (or a little less than half) of you who decided to sit here, on the Left Side. 

You take a moment to regard the group of people on the other side of the Theatre, now facing you, as if in opposition, or complementarity. 

The Three who changed their minds seem to have a certain smugness written over their faces, as if their indecision afforded them insight that you do not have. 

Again, you consider the possibility of getting up from your seat, walking down that treacherous slope, and realigning with those who decided on the [[RIGHT HAND PATH]] --

But still, as a leaping salmon, 
Against the grain, 
In the stark minority, the differential of audience members in their uncomfortable ceramic pews speaking Volumes[^Croen2], you remain. 

Five Screens are directly above you, just high enough for you to still see those smug faces who took the [[RIGHT HAND PATH]] in front of you, even while viewing the screens themselves. 

Each of the Five displays render a Split Screen each. 
On the Left of each, you see the rows of audience of which you form a part. The Left Handers. 
Given your lesser numbers, there are a few opportunities for you to gaze into the absences, the spaces where somebody may have sat, had they been brave enough. And in these spaces, uncovered by audience members, you are given the chance to peer upon the uncomfortable Yellowness of the tiles upon which you are sat. 

And in your gazing, becoming lost in the grout, becoming a genderless void trapped in the yellow grout, you almost miss the entrance of the Artist. 

They enter, punctuated by a nervous, tentative applause, seemingly indifferent to it. 
Their eye is on their goal. 

The Right side of each of the Split Screens now show their purpose, showing the Artist as they mount the gurney, strapping three of their limbs, but leaving one arm (the one which still sports a hand) unbound. 

You decide to keep your own eye upon the live scene below, not wishing to peer upon the uncanny reflection of your own face in its voyeurism, although the placement of the Screens seems to have intentionally prevented for ability to completely avoid it. 

The air is thick with tension, the silence providing fertile ground for the horrific squeak of the gurney as the Artist prepares to perform. There are none of the usual pre-performance whispers. From anybody in the crowd. Even those opposite you on the [[RIGHT HAND PATH]] have all but fallen silent. The smugness drained from their faces, like the endless streams of blood that once flowed down the reversed-pyramid of the Theatre's tiled floor. 

And now, directly over the grate, Xeno clicks that monstrous machine into action; those inevitable wheels begin their whirring. 

The dark ribbon's purpose unveils itself, unforgivably - that mythic substance you've heard about, but never seen - VHS tape. 

One side of VHS tape is for recording and playing back visual signal, as the ancient peoples of anteAntiquity used to utilise for their 'Videos'. But many are unaware that the other side can also hold data, albeit at a reduced quality. 

It seems that the Artist has set up these reels-within-reels in a way which utilises both sides, but the magnetic tape (the dark ribbon contrasting their bright yellow hair tie) is ligated together in a Möbius strip. As the wheels begin their turning, you see- the cameras, the microphones, they are both feeding into, and being fed by, the tape. If tape medium is wrapped with a single twist in the way Xeno has crafted, the resulting signal replays the recorded data, and then reverses it, before ending where it started. 

But Xeno has apparently rigged multiple tape heads, so that the signal displayed on those horrifying, abominable mirrors, was constantly being written over, and you see yourself, your selves, your past and perhaps future selves, recoiling at your own reflection, again and again, uncomfortably sat next to Xeno as they lie down upon their gurney, and begin to sing without accompaniment, other than the dreadful hum of the wheels. Those Wheels within Reels within Wheels. 

They are singing a melody entirely unheard by you before. 
In an impossible scale. 
The tones seem to *crumple* in upon themselves, 

You cannot tear your eyes away, and even if you could, your previously-peering eyes would be repeatedly replayed, again and again, to your fellow audience members. There is no turning away. No turning back. There is no covering of your ears that can keep this Sacred Siren Song from being heard. 
It demands its own becoming.
It hisses, insisting on being observed.

And on being observed, it is collapsing upon itself. A wave. A Goodbye. A Fare Thee Well to any sense of equally divided octave you may have known heretofore. 
It is coming from within you, too. 
A truth, reeled within the lie of everything that preceded it. 
It is getting in. 
It is beating its sickly, sickly drum. 
From the deepest chamber of your gated heart. 


You notice, whether on the screen or in 'reel' time, for on this side of the stage, both are the Same -
That Xeno is raising her one free arm to her Temple. 
You notice that this space is now a Temple. 
To a God long forgotten, but not in any way missed. 
Not missed because not looked for. Not wanted. 
Trodden down and folded in, for the danger of its Truth - 


Xeno clicks a button on the side of their head, and then -
The screams. 
Dear God, the screams
Seemingly reversed- but How?

How can a human create the sound of its own reversal?
You do not know, you only know that you cannot move. 
You cannot move, and your face, frozen in a grimace; is no longer yours to move - 
You hear the impossible sound of a cry of agony screamed *inward*
A reversed recording, but live, alive, slithering all around the abysmal room - 

And into Xeno. 

It began with their toe; their second toe, and this starting point, you intuit, without consciously realising, has something to do with its being the part of their body afforded the furthest distance from their eye. 

This beginning is your end, of any restful sleep. 
For never will you shake this image from your brain - 
The artist begins to *in-crease*; 
Their body folding in upon itself, into a brutal nothingness 

Both of their feet are gone now, and this is confirmed by the screen above your heads - 
To where your eye now helplessly darts - 
And sees, in perhaps much greater horror, 
A smile, stretched across your own face. And not only yours, but the entire Left Side of the audience, Grinning as children, watching their favourite cartoon.
You yourselves, animated as puppets on gutstrings;
But the smiles, dear God the smiles are not human - 
They stretch so far beyond the possible limit, 
You bring your hands to your face, it doesn't match the scene unfurling before you - 
You jolt your head from left to right, and even right to left, desperately checking the evidence of your own, uncollapsed eyes, and see the other Left Siders doing the same. 
Those on the Right appear to not be concerned with such matters. 
Instead, they are transfixed upon the screens. Something is keeping their eyes, tied with yellow, yellow, ribbons, upon their own screens. They are seeing something you are not. And you, in turn, are seeing a sight not shown to them. 

The Sound of Xeno's death rattle itself has, by now, collapsed, into a guttural, thunderous *gurgle*
You think for just a moment of the sound of your Mother, blending Celery for soup when you were sick as a very young child. 
Sound, while not as potent as the olfactory sense, has a terrible way of unlocking memories that should stay hidden. 

*But where are the bloodstains*, you find yourself thinking. 
The Gurney remains so clinically blank of any evidence - 
Of the horror that is folding, unfolding, folding -
You see the blood, Oh, there is so much of it, 
Pooling impossibly, 
Like mercury, or a blackened, burgundy ferrofluid, 
Being magnetised toward the top of Xeno's quickly dwindling form - 
They are just a ribcage now, and their intestines are falling out and in - 
You had no idea the colour of intestines before, you'd hoped you'd never know, 
But now you do. 
They are so much yellower than you'd ever imagined,
You are even given the chance to see Xeno's final meal, in the final bend of its digestion, 
as the lumen of their intestines open, wilting, unblossoming, like a timelapse of Roses played in reverse - 
In spite of yourself, trapped in this inner circle of Hell, you just pray for whatever 'Art' this is, to go quicker, to have its dastardly deed be done, dear God, even if it means the certain End of the Artist-
*They are still gurgling, 
Organs lost
Eye-glossed, 
Glossolalic 
Howling in tongues
They are Ululating their infernal scale*
Not only this, but the *in-crease* of their form, provides an accompaniment you'd thought was missing;
for this uncharted Aria, 
was not composed to be performed a cappella 
And you hear this, clearly, 
All too clearly, 
With every squelch, and fetid crack 
Of bone and sinew, cartilaginous clew, 
Reeling back into its unknown origin

The ribs now, 
The ribs are peeling *in*
Like the legs of a camera tripod, 
That will never be disassembled by the hands, or rather 
Single Hand
That so carefully had placed it to Face and Look upon you

As you watch 
You watch your watching
But not you, Watching 
You apparently are laughing, 
All of you 

But you cannot hear a single sound of joy - 

All you hear is the lightning crack of ribs, 
Crushing themselves
under some unknowable weight - 

And then, they are just a torso, 
No limbs, 
They have now joined the Hand they longed to be reunited with

Xeno is just a chest now, a chest you wish you'd never opened 
A Lock you to which you wished there was no key; 
You have not stopped wanting to Leave, 
You want to sorely to have already Left, 
The Left, The Right, All of it, Behind you-
But something in the hammered-nail-file iron of the reel-to-reel is reeling you-
And nobody, Right nor Left, has been able to have Left-
And yet, 
their eyes remain uplifted, transfixed upon those screens;
*What Right-Sided, televised scene could possibly begin to rival this horrific End?


For a moment you see their heart beating, it is beating exactly in rhythm to this Gordian Chant, their body is a pulsing requiem - 
For a single second you find yourself comparing the appearance of the human lung to coral, though you have never had the chance to see the latter, no matter how much more likely you'd assumed that would be. 
*W--Why?!* you hear somebody not-quite next to you utter, 
It seems all of you in this audience are struck with the same, undeniably ubiquitous sensation
As in a nightmare of an all-to-reel-to-realist dream; 
Attempting to run, to save yourself, a loved one, escape, or scream 
But facing the deepest burden of Weight, 
A heaviness, a Hellish Gate - 

Whoever this person in the audience was, had clearly been trained well in sleep paralysis. 
You gave up minutes ago, even trying to make a sound- 
Perhaps, you think, the sound was not made by an audience member at all 
Perhaps it was the Artist's body in responding to their Art;


But they, Xeno, (singular, plural, every part of them) has fallen all-but silent now
At least by virtue of the folding of their vocal folds, 
Which you watched, just then, become nothingness. 

You wonder if their hair will go. 

If all that will be left,
is that little yellow[^y] bow. 

And then the jaw, and teeth, they crunch 
Perhaps with the deepest resonance;
That sound brings every hateful dentist to your door;
Please, dear god, you think, no more, no more- 

The blood vessels, a halo revealed in the centre of this wretched, unravelling of a web-
It's spidery limbs seem to gesture, in their Cthulhu-esque tentacular curling tumult, to the Anatomical diagram to your Right, and to the Right Side's Left
The Circle of Willis; was this what this whole, unholy, fulminant, sickly head-spinning implosive performance was presented for?
To what end? To make what point? To make drosophila[^dro] of us all?

By the time your eyes return to Xeno, 
Or to their unrested remains,
To rest upon the place where Xeno once had been, 
Only a single eye remained 
Just one: 
Left.
