the right hand path
You walk up the ramp, and take your seat. 
You notice the tall doors of the escape route open and close once more - apparently some of the Others have rethought their decision. 
Others still, Three of them, have joined you on this Side of the Theatre. 
Xeno enters the space. 
You clap, gingerly, briefly looking around to ensure you aren't the only one performing the canonical gesture of approval. 
Xeno is strapping their legs to the gurney. 
Then their right arm, which you notice now is without a hand. 
With an awful click, a reeling regret of your decision-
The performance begins. 

On the Five Screens above your eyeline, your gaze becomes locked, 
Like all those times, inexplicably, when we may find ourselves staring at an object, or rather through an object, with a heavenly sensation of nothingness. 
On the left side, the gurney, the microphones, the reel-to-reel, but curiously, surreally, no Xeno of which to speak. 
And on the right of each Split screen, you see your own face, gazing uncontrollably, 
Controlled by the Will of something Else, 
The Need to be a Witness. Or, much worse, the crushing need to be Witnessed. 

Despite the ungodly sounds erupting from the performer, still, you cannot move your eyes.
You realise something awful must be happening in the room, 
Amidst, around that alien, Gordian Chant,
You hear the Left Side of the audience shuffling and attempting to cry out, like a sleeping body's chest, weighted by a succubus - 

And then, you see a toe, 
a foot,
a leg appear upon the gurney, 
Then two, 

Xeno is, for lack of a better word, 
*Buffering*
onto the Left side of the CCTV screen. 

Your shock at this strange sight, is reflected in perfection on the Right-
You are being given your own reaction footage to this scene 

And yet, you cannot bear to peer upon the physicality, or, you physically cannot tear your eyes from this screen;

jittering, with a silvery cord, that stretches across from right to left,[^BTF]
a digitising gossamer, 

this artifact from time passed seems to bind your image to theirs, 
your faces, watching, 
Watching-
Voyeurs voyaged on the Right Banks of this Sordid, Soap-Sodden Operating Theatre 
Are pulling Xeno's body, 
Cell by cell by sinew, 
into the imprisoned pixels of the Screen

As those impossibly microtonal notes turn to a churning, chthonic *slosh*, 
And now a *crunch*
and then a *snap*, so deeper, deeper than twigs underfoot, 
and taller, so taller, taller than a felling tree 
In darkest dark of this cruel fluorescence, 
rendered in a brutal RGB
Split to triplets, as the cells in the back walls of the cells of the retina,  
which, with your own, you expect to view, soon on that evil screen 
But as Xeno worms toward attempt at wholeness of their form, immortal
Again to lie, though now in silent yellowed-milk, the one-eyed not-girl almost-rendered, a hole there left a recess, or a portal 

And still, even with your face reflected back at you, next to them onscreen, 
You know, regardless of how 'real' your likeness may appear, you know you aren't like that not-quite-dead person, who's eyeless form remained only on these Five Screens above you, in this not-quite-hospital.
Not you. 
You decided to be on the Right Side of their Last Recorded Story.[^story] 
And,
Be*sides*
you think,
As you flee the scene with all the others, teeming fleas now seemingly allowed to leave, yet unable to look back to, or rewind
The saline pillage of that awful orbital mess now Left behind 
You can't erase that data from your mind-{TAKE THIS OUT TAKE THIS OUT THEY CANNOT KNOW THEY CANNOT KNOW THEY KNOW NOW THEY KNOW THEY KNOW THEY KNOW NO NO NO NO NO SHE CANNOT NO MY PRONOUNS ARE SHE/HER MY PRONOUNS ARE REDACT REDACT IT REDACTED RED RING PARALLEL - by the woman in the wallpaper - N.B. Knot by Not Borges}
That socket, dried out void, no light
you daren't bear the unreeled sight 
And as you scattered crows take flight,
You think I know which eye decided: 
Right?
