- before xenos' birth (deadname: Perigee) - Selena(mother)/My(father)'s abilities mis en abyme, write papers & create field of aesthetic hermeticism 
- xeno has a de novo mutation - night blindness --> total blindness by 23, seen by myo's (their father's) Flash Forward Frames\[FFFs] (the ability to see all quantum causal clouds before him, every possible outcome, without ever knowing exactly which will happen until he actually makes the decision.) 
	- Selena is their mother, and has 'hermetic memory' - the ability to gain all ancestral memory from anything/one she touches, but only ever exclusively when the threads of fate are woven for such - i.e. when she, or the person/thing involved *needs* to know or is *ready* to know said historical/philological/hermetically sealed/epigenetic history. 
- Perigee's 'standing stones' - schoolyard punishment --> selena pulls Xeno out of school 
- selena on bughouse hexagonal chess tour / ancestral pilgrimage --> myo performs surgery to implant CopняKoпя - in order to save xeno's vision, by implanting Endivean technology (based upon a refined version of his own FFF's that aren't so visually overwhelming)
- selena finds out through hermetic memory ability --> beginning of their marriage breakdown
