**XENO’S TAKE UP REÆL**
**Audience Configuration and Split Screens**
1. **Audience Division**:
• The audience is physically split into **left side** and **right side**, mirroring complementary DNA strands or opposing narrative perspectives.
• Each half of the audience views a **unique split-screen projection** that reflects their role as either the “observer” (Input Reel) or the “observed” (Output Reel).
**Split-Screen Content**
**Left Side (Input Reel)**
• **Left Panel**: Live recording of the audience, capturing them as they are. However, their faces are mysteriously altered in real time, manipulated to appear smiling, regardless of their actual emotional state. This creates an uncanny dissonance, highlighting the observer being warped by the act of observation.
• **Right Panel**: A live feed of the performer (Xeno) in the real-time performance space, showing them dissolving into a single eye. This unfiltered “documentary” style reinforces the perception that this is the “real” performance space.
**Right Side (Output Reel)**
• **Left Panel**: Live recording of the performer (Xeno), but this feed starts **empty**—the performance space is devoid of Xeno, suggesting archival footage or a deliberate omission. As the performance progresses, Xeno’s form gradually “fills in,” reconstructed fragment by fragment, until a warped, almost uncanny version of them appears fully.
• **Right Panel**: Live recording of the audience, unaltered. Their reactions (horrified, contemplative, etc.) are captured exactly as they are, showing no manipulation. This highlights the performer as the subject being warped in this perspective.
**Progression of the Duality**
1. **Act 1: The Split**
• The left side sees Xeno clearly present in their panel, performing in real time, while the audience appears to smile in the left panel regardless of their true expressions.
• The right side sees Xeno absent from their panel, leaving a ghostly void in the performance space, while the audience’s expressions are preserved as-is.
This establishes a sense of disorientation: both halves of the audience are aware that something strange is happening, but only have half of the story.
2. **Act 2: The In-Crease**
• **Input Reel (Left Side)**: Xeno begins their transformation into a single eye. This process is documented in excruciating detail, as though a medical or scientific experiment is being recorded. The altered audience footage adds a layer of horror: they are complicit in the performance through their observation, but their manipulated smiles suggest a sinister external force is rewriting their role.
• **Output Reel (Right Side)**: As Xeno collapses into the single eye in the live performance space, the “empty” performer feed begins to “fill in.” Fragments of Xeno appear one by one, almost like a glitchy reconstruction, until a complete but distorted version of them stands on screen, seemingly unmoored from the real-time performance. This version may lack the remaining eye, foreshadowing their liminal existence between worlds.
3. **Act 3: The Convergence**
• The split-screen feeds reach their climax as the transformation completes.
• On the **Input Reel**, Xeno fully dissolves into a single eye, while the smiling audience footage remains eerily intact, despite their visible horror in the real space.
• On the **Output Reel**, Xeno appears fully reconstructed but grotesquely warped, with one eye missing. Meanwhile, the audience is shown unaltered, as if reflecting the reality the left side cannot see.
The final moments align the two perspectives: the Input Reel shows the observer being rewritten, while the Output Reel shows the subject being rewritten, creating a perfect complementarity akin to DNA replication. The audience’s understanding of what truly happened depends entirely on their willingness to revisit and reconstruct both perspectives.
**Easter Eggs and Deeper Meaning**
• **Manipulated Smiles**: For attentive viewers, the warped audience footage on the Input Reel foreshadows the AI’s ability to overwrite memory and perception, hinting that the reality they are witnessing may not be reliable.
• **Xeno’s Reconstruction**: The gradual filling in of Xeno on the Output Reel reflects the process of encoding/decoding in DNA replication, as well as the precarious balance of subjectivity and objectivity in the act of creation and observation.
• **Split Audience**: By dividing the audience physically and conceptually, the performance mirrors the splitting and pairing of DNA strands, emphasizing duality and the impossibility of seeing the whole picture from one perspective alone.
