## Audience Configuration and Split Screens

### Audience Division
| **Aspect**              | **Details**                                                                                          |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Physical Split           | The audience is divided into **Left Side** (Input Reel) and **Right Side** (Output Reel).            |
| Narrative Parallel       | Mirrors complementary DNA strands or opposing narrative perspectives.                                |
| Screen Configuration     | Each side views a **unique split-screen projection** reflecting their role as **Observer** or **Observed**.|

### Split-Screen Content

#### Left Side (Input Reel)
| **Panel**       | **Content**                                                                                                  |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Left Panel**   | Live audience recording with manipulated faces. All faces appear smiling, regardless of their true emotion. |
| **Right Panel**  | Live feed of Xeno in real time, dissolving into a single eye.                                               |
| **Theme**        | The observer is warped by the act of observation.                                                          |

#### Right Side (Output Reel)
| **Panel**       | **Content**                                                                                                  |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Left Panel**   | Initially empty performer feed. Gradually fills in with reconstructed fragments of Xeno’s form.             |
| **Right Panel**  | Unaltered live audience reactions, showing their authentic emotional state.                                 |
| **Theme**        | The performer is warped by the act of being observed.                                                      |

## Progression of the Duality

### Act 1: The Split
| **Perspective**  | **Content**                                                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Input Reel**    | Xeno is visible in real-time performance; audience faces manipulated into smiling.                         |
| **Output Reel**   | Xeno is absent in the performer feed; audience faces remain unaltered.                                     |
| **Experience**    | Both sides feel disoriented, aware they lack the full story.                                               |

### Act 2: The In-Crease
| **Perspective**  | **Content**                                                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Input Reel**    | Xeno’s transformation into a single eye is documented in detail. Altered smiling audience footage adds horror. |
| **Output Reel**   | The empty performer feed begins to “fill in” with fragments of Xeno, eventually forming a distorted version. |
| **Experience**    | The observer and observed perspectives grow more distinct, revealing complementary halves of the story.    |

### Act 3: The Convergence
| **Perspective**  | **Content**                                                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Input Reel**    | Xeno fully dissolves into a single eye; smiling audience footage remains intact despite visible real-space horror. |
| **Output Reel**   | Xeno is fully reconstructed on screen but grotesquely warped. Audience footage remains unaltered.          |
| **Experience**    | Final moments align observer (Input Reel) and observed (Output Reel) perspectives into a cohesive narrative. |

## Easter Eggs and Deeper Meaning
| **Easter Egg**            | **Details**                                                                                              |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Manipulated Smiles**    | Foreshadows AI’s ability to overwrite memory and perception, hinting at unreliable reality.              |
| **Xeno’s Reconstruction** | Reflects DNA encoding/decoding and the precarious balance between subjectivity and objectivity.          |
| **Split Audience**        | Mirrors DNA strand splitting and emphasizes duality, requiring both perspectives for full understanding. |
