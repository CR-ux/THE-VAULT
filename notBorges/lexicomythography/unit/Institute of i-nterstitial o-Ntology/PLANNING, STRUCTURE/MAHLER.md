**Queering Mahler’s Symphonies** 
  

By X [[MUSIC 'CRITIQUE']]

	*Loses (or indeed sacrifices) a finger, or hand, forcing her to a life of music critique rather than her previously (paradoxically restrictive )*

- numerological references/resonances with each of the Eight Symphonies
- the 'sacrifice' of her hand (related to relevant archetypal gender she resists, perhaps right, also her dominant hand) allows the interpolation of Mythology - explored by another character in the 'collective' of the Web
- [[YOU'VE GOT IT BACKWARDS]]
- [[ARIA-DNE SCHISM]]
  

  

  

  

  

The following is entirely for comedic purposes but is also entirely factual. This podcast is a parody but I never joke. 

  comprehensive list of the genders of Mahler's Nine Complete Symphonies (and at least one unfinished)

First:

- very femme AMAB homosexual, faggy as hell and not afraid to show it 
- D major? More like majorly into D 

  

The Master

  

Cis = fifth - most famous, most accessible 

  

  

Trans = 2nd - resurrection 

  

  

Enby - 8 - reference to Faust and invokes the Holy Spirit - ambitious and ocntraversial
