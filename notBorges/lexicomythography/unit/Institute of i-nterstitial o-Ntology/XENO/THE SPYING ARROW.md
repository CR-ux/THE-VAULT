permalink: THE SPYING ARROW
---
the years have torn my wings from me 
my hollow bones, weighted
filled and weighted 
substanced burden


i am not the sparrow 
never could have been 

flight a folly 
the sky-made silence 
joke after joke 
at immeassurable cost to me 

I am but the Arrow 
slicing through a breath 
I missed 

What softness 
Did my blade cut through?

From which warm hand 
Did I draw this ore?

My regretting motion 
never ceasing or arriving 

My biting thoughts 
canâ€™t hold 
remembrance of the Bow 

its tautness and tautology
