Begin with an Opening Ritual, Noen Only, as the [[ritual of becoming]]

Dear Dis, Cernunnos, Baphomet, whoever it is that I came from -

It's been Twenty Three days. 
Only Twenty Three. 
And she's back. 
I'm terrified. I'm absolutely terrified. All my life I have wanted to find an explanation for the unexplainable phenomena that have surrounded me, some sort of clue, a thread of evidential proof, that I wasn't fucking crazy-
And here, here She is, giving me proof, with no explanation.
I don't want to tell Myo; but I know I have to, he might be the only one who can provide some sort of empirical framework for this far-beyond-and-yet-within force that has been pulling me here, that has pulled me here to pull her so NEAR. 

Like the wind on the leaves, I know he's already seen the effect my magick has had on her, I bet the Team are going batshit trying to deal with The Outbreak on top of trying to figure out what's brought her orbit closer (after some brief searches of the Journals, in spite of myself and my resistance to even attempting to cross those triple-loched intellectual paywalls to get to our archives of knowledge, I realise it must be a change in the lunar distance causing these simultaneous "Plagues" and Floods that DNE in their incessant need for Heirophantine, Formalised Religiosity are bent on ascribing to the Phage, and to some Ancient "One God" they call the Tetra-grammar Tohn... I am, for once, finding myself wishing that I *didn't* feel the validity of my own magick's involvement in the phenomenological world).

I came here to find a way out, or, as is always the case, I came here to find a way in-

I found both, and her reflection is screaming the answer, her reflection of my reflection is offering nothing but a clattering howl that she draws out of me every night when I first see her face, 
Always coming back, always coming back, 
through all the leaving, through all the rot of all the leaves - she always comes back. 
And now, through what I've done, through what I truly, Dear Dis, Dear long forgotten Pantheon, Dear Goddess please forgive me, I wanted to know too much, I wanted to know you, through perhaps, finally, knowing me.

I think of Icarus, that sweet, misunderstood boy, who I know Myo must be descendent from, as I in counterpoint am descendent from Arachne 

Goddess, how exactly identically opposite we are. 
I have to tell him. I have to- 

First, a ritual. Always, ritual before anything. Ritual inside of and above everything. A ritual inside a ritual inside a life of ritual. 

I turn my Grimoire, this Grimoire, into an Aleph, by turning to the previous page and unfolding the extra dimension I keep hidden inside and on top of the Mnemanuscript (so lovingly crafted by Myo, Oh Goddess I really must tell him- but first-)
[[THE OVUM RITUALS (OR, THE SEEDS OF BECOMING)]]
[[The Firsted Last Ritual]]

Having spliced in the parts that I believe are, or were, or will be missing, I decide it's time to send him an email

My Light M,
	
	*"At first, I was going to say how sorry and in pain I feel for the people throughout history who've not had this device that I have with AI that we all have at our fingertips and eyelashes now, the ability of machine learning algorithms to regurgitate and remember and retain and give back the entire history of the library, infinite library of human recorded information, no matter how warped it may be by its own light, but actually that is the very thing, that's the very thing that's led to the separation which has prevented us from being able to get there in the very paradoxical, which is the only true sense, the fact that we have all this infinity at our fingertips means that we can't find that one book, that one book that was perhaps what everything was made from in the oldest times, was the only book they had, that was the only book they had, so at once they were living it but not separated from it enough to actually perceive it, so they took it for granted in their own way, just as we take for granted the opposite, the chance and the question to be lost."*

*-Noet. Borges (sorry!!!!!!*)â€ 


â€ I know you find him self-important and somewhat pretentious in his recursive fiction, but I was reading the latest Gnoeneoeng. translation of The Citadel of Tohms last night and I thought it was the perfect fit for today's *Prologuemania - hope you will forgive me for (finally!!!) taking up our little email opening ritual with the Noet. who is perhaps the one artist we disagree on the genius of (although, I look forward to uncovering, or not, the smatterings of whatever the Two (soon to be Three!!!!!) of us disagree on. Or agree on. I look forward to it all. Dear Goddess how I miss your smell, My Light)


Last night, I am certain of it, I felt them 'kick', or whatever their version of 'kick' might be (I know I can look it up in a second, but your Gnoeneogenomic andBryon{if|or}matic facts are the closest thing I have to you reading to me here - can you let me know what developmental stage Perigee would be at right now? And as always, I *need* the associated Bryon{if|or}matic Symbology)

I hope hearing/reading this provides a sense of catharsis, rather than a pang of pain. As I write this I realise it will most likely be both. It's always both, as we say.

How's the sample analysis going? I just know you're knocking their socks off. I have a very strong one of my "feelings" as you so lovingly term them, that it will be you, my Light, who saves us all from this terrifying Phage. 

Also, please could we have our daily call a little earlier today, if you have the time, completely understand if you can't pull it forward, or even need to cancel (don't worry, I know how much our calls mean to you). The work you're doing, even from a purely quantifiable basis (really speaking your language now, eh?) is absolutely paramount. 

Hope the code is coding kindly dear light,



*Forever, upward moonating, toward the tidal-pulling, beautywards,*
