Dear Dis, Cernunnos, Baphomet, whoever it is that I came from -

It's been Twenty Three days. 
Only Twenty Three. 
And she's back. 
I'm terrified. I'm absolutely terrified. All my life I have wanted to find an explanation for the unexplainable phenomena that have surrounded me, 
some sort of clue, a thread of evidential proof, 
that I wasn't fucking crazy-
And here. Here She is, 
giving me proof, with no explanation.

I don't want to tell Myo.
But--no. 
I know. 
I have to. 
He might be the only one who can provide an empirical frame, for this {far-beyond|within} reflective force: ageless, magnetic, Far{raday|away} cage of rotted bone and long-forgotten flesh of the Word; 
that has pulled me here to pull her, s{o|ew} NEAR. 

Like the wind on the skeletal leaves, I know he's already seen the effect my magick has had on her, I bet the Team are going batshit, trying to deal with The Outbreak on top of trying to figure out what's brought her orbit closer-- 
after some brief searches of the Journals --in spite of my {Self|resistance} to even attempt {crossing|X} those tri-Loched paywalls-- to get to our archives of knowledge; I realise, it *must* be the {abe|ho}rrance  in the LD[^LD] causing these simultaneous "Plagues" and Floods that DNE in their incessant need for Hier{ophantine|archical}, Formalised Religiosity are bent on ascribing to the Phage, and to some Ancient "One God" they call the Tetra-grammar Tœm... I am, for once, finding myself wishing that I *didn't* feel the validity of my own magick's involvement in the phenomenological world.

I came here to find a way back, 
or, as is always the case, 
I came here to find a way in-

I found both. Her reflection, screaming as an answer. Her G{listening}.
Misery-- Abysmal. 
Beaming: as She offers nothing, but an offering. 
Ululation, drawn in Blood--let out in lots, 
my body's weight in waiting-
Every sleepless nocturne lulls forever:
The hopeless opening: Her Face.
Always returning. {Infe|Ete|Noctu}rnal.
Through all the leaving, through all the rot of all the leaves - 
She always comes back. 
And now, through what I've done, 
through what I truly, Dear Dis, 
Dear long-forgotten Pantheon, 
Dear Goddess please forgive me, 
I wanted to know too much, 
I wanted to know *You*, 
through perhaps, finally, 
knowing me.

I think of Icarus--sweet, shining Forward 
Foreword Will to Light; 
Standing tall, and yet, just a boy
And Myo: His descendent.
While I, in retrograde, spin down, 
Arachne 

Goddess, how {identical| 
opposite}ly paired we are. 
I have to tell him. I have to- 

Anything. After. Ritual.
Ritual. Before. Anything. 
Ritual {inside|above} everything. 
A Life, 
	{W{Ri(gh)t{Ten(*X*)}}} 
		{of|from|for} 
			{Rit{Ritual}ual} 
						of Ritual.
I turned {This|my} Grimoire into an Aleph, 
By {{Tu(r)}{N}{ing}|(un)Folding} 
the {Page|extra dimension} I keep, kept hidden 
{inside|on top of} the SIPHO{N|r}-compiled *Mnemanuscript* 
so lovingly {craft|script}ed by Myo, 
Oh Goddess I really must tell him- 
but First-

![[LAST RITUAL]]

Last night, I am certain of it, I felt them 'kick', or whatever their version of 'kick' might be (I know I can look it up in a second, but your Gnoeneogenomic and Bryon{if|or}matic facts are the closest thing I have to you reading to me here - can you let me know what developmental stage Perigee would be at right now? (As always, I *need* the associated Bryon{if|or}matic Symbology)

I hope hearing/reading this provides a sense of catharsis, rather than a pang{leaving you}of pain. As I write this I realise it{will most likely be}'s always both. As{w{(yo)u}e|i}say.[^assay]

How's the sample analysis going? I just know you're knocking their socks off. I have a very strong one of my "feelings" as you so lovingly term them, that it will be you, my Light, who saves us all from this terrifying Phage. 

Also, please could we have our daily call a little earlier today, if you have the time, completely understand if you can't pull it forward, or even need to cancel (don't worry, I know how much our calls mean to you). The work you're doing, even from a purely quantifiable basis (really speaking your language now, eh?) is absolutely paramount. 

Hope the code is coding kindly dear light,

*Forever, upward moonating, toward the tidal-pulling, beautywards,*

I look {{{back|for}ward} to} it all. Dear Goddess how I miss your smell, My Light)
