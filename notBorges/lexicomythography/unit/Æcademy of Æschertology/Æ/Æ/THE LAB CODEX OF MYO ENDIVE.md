permalink: THE LAB CODEX OF MYO ENDIVE
---
Myo clicked his noise-cancelling implant to 'Total Silence' (which of course, given his highly networked brain, could never really be *totally* silent, but at least it wasn't added to by the incessant stream of external, empirical resonance data). 

He was at his bench in The Lab, opening the very-loved-and-therefore-almost-falling-apart-at-the-spine Book that he termed his "Lab codex", once yellow, now a shimmering Gold, his still-all-too-human-yet-Yellow-Labrador-boyfriend-archetype-esque essential oils gradually exposing the Mnemanuscript circuitry underneath as water erodes a stone.

He had, as a child, been 'diagnosed' with a 'condition'[^condition], still undocumented in any other individual as he reached his Second Third of life (which, as you and I both know, does not necessarily mean he was the only person with the 'condition'). 

The 'condition' was known as Heisenberg's Prognostication Syndrome (HPS), but Myo preferred his own term "Schröharbinger's Un-insight", which certainly provided a comedic, Thalia-to-Melpomene contrast to Selena's much more characteristically mystical description of "quantum prophecy". In layperson's terms, Myo could perceive, or rather had no choice but to perceive, every given outcome of every choice he made, without ever knowing which would occur following said choice. He often thanked whatever archetypal (or, as Selena might frame it, ancestral) forces prevented him from seeing the outcome of anyone *else's*, as he was sure that would be an even more torturous Hell, far beyond the Gates[^Gate] of Hades[^Hades] he found himself in.

His "Dis[^Dis]-Arrays[^array]", as he termed them (causal clouds of potential, observed as synaesthetic forking paths), were similar to the 'trails' of presently-manifest empirical bodies moving through space (like the 'open shutter' movement of his hand caressing his beloved's face, naked under a Full Moon, the night before she left), that he had observed during his many psychedelic trips with Selena; resembling the individual frames of a motion picture, frozen in space long enough for the subject to see them, 'trailing' behind the moving Body in question. Only (though perhaps, not solely) in Myo's case, the 'trails' stretched 'forward' in phenomenological space, into higher dimensions than just the Third. 

He wondered, in his welcomed sonic (but not causal) silence, if[^if] he should open his EdeniaStudio IDE[^IDE] or his email, and send Selena an update. His very wondering, of course, splintering into countably infinite 'fast-forward frames (FFF)', which he immediately shook off by landing on the (unbeknownst to him, inevitable) 'decision' of his daily email checkin. Of course, this very choice, while collapsing the 'previous' FFFs (like melted wax wings of a well-intentioned boy who approached the Sun too intimately), erupted another dis-array of FFFs (dancing out of his body like the Spinneret-woven silk of a Spider who just wanted to spin beauty out of her forever).

Then came another tumultuous Devil's fork, as he tried to think of the best 'move' in their ongoing email game of '*Prologuemania*', in which they would open the bodies of their emails with a quote from a Body of work that felt moving to them in that moment. Opening his email to find another of her snapshots, a frozen frame of the motion picture that was their love, that they were collaboratively writing together, through this immeasurably measurable distance, was the highlight of his day. 

He decided to go with a verse from Vladimir Nabokov's *Pale Fire*

**From:** M

**Subject:** How's My Extraordinary Machine?

He went to click 'Send', before a particularly violent FFF of a potential response (not from Selena. From some other Body that could, in the endless Library of potentialities, be writing the story their motion picture was adapted fro--), no matter how unlikely, forced him to reconsider his choice of Nabokov quote. 

Still wanting to honour his initial desire to honour the incredible Russian novelist-poet (and, more importantly, Entomologist; or, more specifically, and even more importantly, Lepidopterist[^lepidos]) he deleted his email 'foreword' and replaced it with another collection of characters from *Pale Fire*:

> ~~*"The sea is a thief: it dissolves the moon.”*~~

No, no, he thought - that's far too dire, given the circumstances. So he tried another Nabokovian move:

“All colors made me happy: even Gray.  
My eyes were such that literally they  
Took photographs. ”

Good thing I made these revisions, he thought- *I almost forgot the email signature-*

> -M

After one last glimpse at his initial, a pictograph of two archways, both the start of the word 'Mirror' and a perfect symbolic representation of the symmetry a mirror invokes, or, M could be for 'More', as in, more importantly: the wings of a lepidopteran[^lepidos], or, equally, the sound of some Body pondering over their writing-

He sent the email, and went back to work.


[^condition]: A condition is something essential to the appearance or occurrence of something else, especially an environmental requirement. For example, _Myo’s happiness was conditional on the occurrence of a daily call with Selena in the midst of this Pandemic madness_ or[^OR] _The condition for the Earth to maintain equilibrium in its tides is intricately linked to its distance from the Moon; as She draws closer, tidal forces grow stronger, promising catastrophic flooding and ecological imbalance._
[^OR]:in many programming languages, a logical OR gate is denoted by a double pipe (||), but[^&&!] not[^NOT] python.
[^NOT]:In many programming languages, the NOT operation is denoted by a bang[^bang] (!), e.g. if (!condition) {// Executes if condition is false}, but not[^NOT] python.
[^&&!]:The BUT logic gate isn’t a standard logic gate like AND[^AND], OR[^OR], or NOT[^Gnot], but its functionality can be understood as a conditional (see footnote (1): *conditional*) relationship[^relationship], which may || may not be written as A &&! B, meaning _A occurs and B explicitly does not occur_.
[^bang]:to make a loud and sudden noise.[^noise]  
[^AND]:A double ampersand[^amper] is used in many programming languages to denote the 'AND' Logic Gate.
[^amper]:An ampersand is a symbol which would almost resemble an infinity symbol rotated like an hourglass, if it weren't rendered, through its openness, more like a serpent, Gnotting[^Gnot] over itself, attempting, and not quite achieving, the illusion of an infinity symbol.
[^Gnot]:Gnot (not) !NOT
[^if]:The Logic Gate 'if' can also be expressed in other ways. For example, in JavaScript, conditional logic may be applied through the 'switch'[^switch] statement. 
[^switch]:In kink practices such as S&M, a person who feels comfortable performing (dominant||submissive) roles. 
[^IDE]: IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment, a software application that helps programmers develop code efficiently. || The term "Ides" comes from the Latin word iduare, which means "to divide". In the Roman calendar of antiquity, the Ides marked the rise of the full moon in the middle of the month. || Another term for 'Orfe' [^ORF] a silvery freshwater fish belonging to the carp[^carp] family.
[^carp]:A particular fish that, against all efforts otherwise, often feels lonely. 
[^ORF]: !to be confused with ORF, which stands for Open Reading Frame; the term for the length of DNA which is transcribed into RNA for eventual translation into a protein. 
[^lepidos]: The study of butterflies and moths (lepidopterans), and the Field's name (lepidoptery), derive from the ancient-ancient Greek *lepidos*, which means 'scale', given their wings coverage in tiny scales, overlapping as tiles on a roof. 
[^Gate]:Logic gates are drawn with a symbol showing the input (or inputs) and the output. Inputs are usually drawn on the left (or top[^top]) and outputs on the right (or bottom). A logic gate is the simplest form of a digital switch[^switch]
[^noise]:For example, *The other members of The Team were banging their equipment around in a way that disturbed Myo's sensory hypersensitivities*, |[^contact]
[^contact]:| to come into contact with something: often unexpectedly. For example, *Myo was about to bang into a world-changing discovery that had implications far outreaching both his specialist Fields of Byron{if|or}matics and Aesthetic Hermeneutics*[^hm] , |[^hair]
[^hair]:| In hairdressing || in The story of Samson and Delilah: to cut hair in a style that hangs over the forehead, or in its noun sense, the resulting style from such a cosmetological manoeuvre. For example *Before she left on her pilgrimage to the Outer-Ouro-Hebrides, Myo lovingly banged Selena's hair into a striking bang, which had now grown over her eyebrows in a way he found endearing*, I[^OOO]
[^OOO]:| In an adverbial sense, precisely, exactly right. For example Myo had been banging his head against a wall over his research only to realise his years of toiling against the bureaucratic clergy that academic Science had become that he was slap bang in the middle of his destiny, amidst colleagues whose insensitive banging-about was bang out of order |[^tender]
[^tender]:| In its vulgar, therefore beautifully tender definition, to have sex with someone. For example *The last time they saw each other in person, immediately after he had trimmed her hair into a chic bang, Selena banged Myo for the first time in their three years together as partners, cementing not only a devotional act of vulnerability on his part (he had never bottomed before), but moreso on hers, as it evidenced her sheer level of comfort in her gender identity in his presence (she had never topped before), enough to perform a sexual act so wrongfully attributed as 'masculine'*.
[^array]: An array is a data structure that holds multiple values, each accessed by its index.[^index]
[^Dis]: Dis is the crudely not-quite Roman equivalent of the Greek god Hades.[^Hades]
[^index]:"Index finger" literally means "pointing finger", from the same Latin source as 'indicate'[^indicate]. In python23 ([^BUTNOT]), arrays are 'zero-indexed', that is to say, elements in an array are numbered starting from '0'; which can be quite confusing[^0th]  
[^Hades]: Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? || hast thou seen the gates of Hades?- Job 38:17[^17]
[^17]:Seventeen is the Number of The Star in the Twenty Three Cards of The Gnoeneomajor Arcana, Myo's favourite Tarot card (much to Selena's surprise; and the topic of discussion during their first date, where Selena had won their first (and last) game of Hexagonal Chess, which was not at all surprising to either of them).
[^indicate]:Early-Early ~17th[^17] Century (though, we cannot be sure) Latin "in-" (towards) && "-dicare" (make known) i.e. *With every motion of Myo's phalangeal member of index distinction, countably infinite, entomoid movements stretched out in front of him, like his own, personal, holographic Kronenberg movie, with him as the lonely protagonist && sole audience member*.
[^relationship]:Three Years, Two Months, One Day. Three People, Once Two, One Family.
[^BUTNOT]:&&![^&&!] The Twenty Three other programming[^FORTRAN] languages (at the time of compiling) where the array[^array] index starts from 1.
[^0th]:similar to how the 'First Century ERA_Æ' actually refers, retrospectively, to the '0th' century, which is the first. Labels, whether made of alphabetical or numerical characters, have an equally insufficient character. Nonetheless, let us get back to Myo, the initial character at hand[^index]
[^FORTRAN]: The oldest programming language still in use (at the time of composing), FORTRAN, has a customisable index, meaning the programmer can choose where to begin &&![^BUTNOT] where t--
[^top]: In genomics, the top strand refers to the DNA strand that runs in the 5’ to 3’ direction, often used as a reference in genetic sequences. It serves as the template for the complementary bottom[^bottom] strand, which runs in the opposite 3’ to 5’ direction, much like the balance of opposing forces necessary for the transcription of life itself. || In kink practices, a top refers to the dominant or active participant in an interaction, the one who takes the lead or initiates action. As Myo once joked with Selena, “If I’m the top strand, does that mean you’re transcribing me, or are you just flipping me over into complementary submission?”[^topasbottom]  
[^topasbottom]: because: "as we all know, a top is just a bottom who is enough of a bottom to put aside their needs to top the person who wants to bottom equally” - Selena Elk, Exactly Twenty Three Days and Thirty Two Minutes Ago (pre-first-pass[^1stpass]-coitus)
[^bottom]:"but, or rather, butt, isn't a bottom just a top who is enough of a top to assert their equal desire to bottom?" - Myo Endive, Exactly Twenty Three Days Ago (post-pre-second-pass-coitus)
[^1stpass]: In antiquity, a "two-pass" method was used in which RNA sequence reads are first aligned to the reference genome to detect splice junctions. A second pass[^2ndpass] is then performed using the information from splice junctions to increase the quality of the alignment. Read counts are measured on a gene level using STAR[^STAR]
[^2ndpass]:"Shall we go again?" - Myo Endive && Selena Elk, in unison, pre-jinx
