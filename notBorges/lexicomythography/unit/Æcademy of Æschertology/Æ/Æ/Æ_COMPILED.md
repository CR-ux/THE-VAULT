# Æ. HIVEHOUSE OPENING.

The Endive Lab were on another of their 'socials'. The Doc himself absolutely *detested* them; not that he'd ever let his team know, at least, he tried not to. He was the one who even began the initiative, being a fundamentally empathetic, though exceptionally introverted being; not so much needing social interaction himself, but deeply understanding the needs of his fellow academics. 
As such, upon every Scientist's induction, the first thing he'd request is to be referred to under his first name, Myo. His endless string of honourifics were not just too numerous to keep track of, but he was paradoxically repulsed by the Clergy of Intellect which provided his livelihood. So often is the fate of the Scientist, simply wanting to buzz about the safety of their experiments, like a worker Bee serving the Queen of Knowledge and Special Interest. 
Being a creature of incessant Balance, the lead Gnoegenomicist in the burgeoning Field of Non-Ironic Byronif|ormatics (which he had all but spearheaded the development of, leading to his placement as Laboratory Pontiff), he was obsessed with complementarity. And as in the Sense and antiSense strands of DNA, he found himself referring to his so-called 'underlings' by *their* surnames, which perhaps provided the necessary lubricant of boundaries of respect within the teams cogs and axels. These surname declarations were not merely a sign of reverence for his colleagues' talent, but also, contrastingly, held echoes of a Victorian teacher from anteAntiquity, taking his class's Register.
He didn't want to (and would never) admit that he had a favourite lab tech, but he absolutely did. Hamsa. They shared a neuroBeacon, that of *PhotoSentia* (a visual hypersensitivity which afforded the gift of prismatic vision, but made it difficult to work in any conditions other than dimmed Light). This base-pairing of sensory experience from their respective Diviagnoses enabled them to work their long hours in the same section of the Laboratory, which was, as all were, an intersecting Labyrinth of ever-so-slighty, but crucially and noticeably, differing sensory environments. Not only this, being a fellow Over8 (she'd scored 8.76, almost approaching Myo's 8.88, which still placed him as the World Record holder) Hamsa had evidenced an exceptionally promising future in the Field. Myo's quantum foresight, which he kept hidden, more for the fear of further, unbearable fame than the fear of ostracism, had shown him multiple Flash Forward Frames displaying Hamsa's placement as a Sage. The highest position able to be held by an Educator. Myo's (exclusively transamorous) heterosexuality, which he kept hidden, more for the fear of ostracism than the fear of being painted as a predator, played no part whatsoever in his connection to the shimmeringly femme Hamsa. 

The Grand Hall, where the Field Recordings were held each year to Examine the Nine year old Students, was also reserved for Sacred Matches. Just as the Examinations were performed in a rotational modality, so too did the Schedule of Sacred Matches rotate throughout the Week, with Sunnandæg reserved for communal Tarot readings. This schedule, it being out of Examination Season, was posted to the back wall:

| Dæg       | Matches  |
| --------- | -------- |
| Monandæg  | Chess    |
| Tiwesdæg  | Reversi  |
| Wodnesdæg | Scrabble |
| Þunresdæg | Mancala  |
| Frigedæg  | Senet    |
| Sæterndæg | Go       |
| Sunnandæg | Tarot    |
Myo, being primarily future focused, with a terrible memory, kicked himself when he realised upon entering the Hall, that he'd organised the team's social on Chess day. Yet another reason for the *Monandæg Blues*. To the rippled giggles of his colleagues as they all registered for their Matches, he dropped his head to the Hall's honeycomb parquet of deep red Mahogany in resignation. But, as no amount of foresight could have foretold, things were, really, about to look *up*. 

The Endive lab teammates gifted with the AudioSentia neuroBeacon turned to the Right, taking their relevantly coloured Sound Mufflers from the back wall where they hung on their PhoneHooks, as Myo took a moment to appreciate the contrast of sonic inputs erupting in the space. It certainly was a mixed bag of sensory tiles, pieces of concentrated peace and nets of excitable unrest, resonating through and around each of the Nine points of the star shaped hall.

He and Hamsa turned to the Left, where the Sight Shades rested on their Gogglehooks. As always, he clicked the button to extend the stepladder which unfurled like an accordion's bellow, affording his relative shortness some assistance. The Black Shades, the least used due to their opacity, and fewest in number, according to their relative trough of distribution of need amongst the Players, were the hardest to reach. He'd always thought this somewhat of a puzzling conundrum in itself - while he understood that majority Rules, in terms of statistics, those individuals gifted with the most intensely manifest neuroBeacon found themselves in a double-bind of Reaching. 

Hamsa, having already obtained her Purple Shades from the row below his, helped him down from the stepladder, and pressed the button to set the stepladder back to its retracted position with a (to Myo and Hamsa, at least) very satisfying 'snap' (after ensuring her AudioSentiac colleagues had affixed their Mufflers, of course).

Even through their Mufflers, these colleagues seemed to be peering over at a source of particularly viscous resonance. Myo followed their gaze and saw, at the Northmost point of the Hall, a crowd, gathered around one of the Match Tables, cheering loudly. 

*Ah, wonderful*, he thought. *We've a GM in the House*.
Grand Masters, while common, very rarely showed themselves in the Sacred Matches, preferring to go on their Conference Tours and Present their Findings on the various Fields of Chess Theory. But even the Masters needed to let loose every once in a while. 

The GM in question was Selena. 

Myo surrendered to the inevitable, backward-boulder rolling sequence of loss after loss of his Chess games, occasionally glancing back to Hamsa with each rotation of the opponents, who would sympathetically offer a nod of appreciation for bringing the team to their bi-weekly recreational excursion, even if he was, primarily, much more of a Tarot reader. In a way, this incessant humbling was his form of recreation, as after all these years of rampant success in his Field, he often forgot what it felt like to *not* 'win'.

But his greatest, most fruitful and welcomed loss was just around the corner. 

He performed the necessary gesture of Gamesmanship, shaking the victor's hand (who had violently wrangled him into a brutal Checkmate in only Six moves), and took a deep breath to prepare himself for arriving at the GM's station. 

The Sea of the crowd parted to let him through, like a bleating Lamb to certain slaughter, and there she was; the shimmering daughter of the Moon. 

She was wiping beads of perspiratory enthusiasm from her brow, and quickly wiping her hands on her skirt to allow more accurate placement of her pieces, offering him a smile. 

The dawning curiosity on his face, not just enthralled by her beauty, but by the absolute insanity of the strange looking structure on the table between them--

*What the fuck's going on here, then?* he couldn't avoid spurting. 
Laughing, Selena began to explain. Clearly overcome with that beautiful shine of a person about to talk about their Special Interest. 

"This monstrosity is what I like to call *Hivehouse*," She said, barely able to contain her excitement. 
Sighing flirtatiously, he uttered: '*Go on then, enlighten me, Wise One*'
Myo was grateful that Selena immediately sensed the *actual* reverence in this reply, regardless of its surface layer sarcasm. He was also grateful that she didn't seem to recognise him, and that their interaction was free of the usual sycophantic drivel he so often had to navigate, every human interaction shrouded in a doubtful suspicion that the person he was speaking with simply wanted to be associated with his Work. 

"Well!" she began. "Do you know much about Melittology?"
He smiled, buzzing with Gnoegenomic anticipation;
"Actually, a little - my thesis was on the Hermeneutic implications of the Drone Bee Genome" lifting his water to his lips like a naive, much-too underaged newly crowned King drinking from a Chalice.
She seemed simultaneously gladdened and slightly disappointed, knowing that she wouldn't need to explain the dynamics of the Bee Colony.
"Ah, the *drones* - of course. Don't suppose your pronouns are he/him?"
He smiled at the jibe, accidentally inhaling a little of his water mid-sip. She lovingly flicked another bead of moisture from her brow-
"So, before we get into Hivehouse, I simply *must* know. What *are* the hermeneutic implications of the Drone Bee's genome?"
Well played, he thought.
"I have the paper somewhere on my tablet-" he began, hesitated as she waved her hand ever so slightly in response;
"Just gimme the Sparknotes"
"Okay so firstly" he sputtered, quickly freeing his vocal folds of the last few droplets of foreign moisture "it's important you know about the Hermeneutic Loop"
"You mean the theory that describes how a text is understood by relating its constituent parts to the whole, and the whole to its parts?"
He couldn't help himself but be, quite literally, taken aback - his chair almost tilting entirely backward
"Yes! Exactly! Every Work is a Fractal of self-same yet ever-evolving Meaning!"
Selena, like Myo had upon entering the Hall, was then kicking herself as she noticed a veritable *schoolgirl* sigh slip out from her throat, and quickly corrected her dreamy-eyed posture, taking her chin from where it rested, tilted upon her hands.
Myo continued, pretending not to notice. Frankly, he was right there in besottedness with her: 
"Well, as you likely know, given this fucking Frankenstein Chess you've slapped me with-" he saw her about to interject- "yes, yes, I know, Frankentein was the Doctor, not the monster, but trust me-" He lovingly gestured to his lab's employees "I've known quite a few Scary Doctors"
What was left of the crowd around them (they'd become bored of the egregiously blatant, cringeworthy flirting, with no actual *Chess* to speak of - well, perhaps not immediately obvious Chess, anyway) giggled in agreement, the majority of them being Doctoral candidates. 
"As you probably, definitely know, the Drones are the only ones with a haploid genome"
"Yup, the poor guys eh, always only with one half of the puzzle" she conjectured, with a wink-
"Oh trust me, *trust me,* I know." Signalling to his 'he/him' pronoun badge, which he'd, up til now, strategically hidden behind the lapel of his flannel shirt. "So, in hermeneutical terms, the Drones form an interestingly self-same genomic reflection of the Queen from which they're derived--"
"Your thesis is starting to sound more and more like a Work of Gender Studies!" Selena interrupted, enthralled 
"Well you wouldn't be wrong there" he continued- "pretty much everything becomes Gender Studies when you look through a Symbolic lens."
"*Especially* Chess." She replied
"Especially Chess; mate." 
They smiled. Everybody around them had left them to their devices at this point. Neither could blame them, they were both beautifully sick to their stomachs.
"*Anyway*" he carried on; "given their sole role in mating - I won't labour the Chess joke -they lack the foraging genes, as well as the longevity genes that their female counterparts house in their genomes"
"Of course. They more about the sprint, not the long-distance-"
As if proving her point, much to her genuine delight, he impatiently cut her off
"Exactly yes. From a Hermeneutic standpoint, this could be viewed as parallel to the unsustainable nature of Patriarchal structures that were likely pervasive in anteAntiquity"
*Talk dirty to me* Selena managed to avoid saying, instead opting for: "*Now* you're speakin' my language"
"Leme guess, Gender Studies major?"
"Neoshamanic Chess Theory with a Gender Studies Minor, actually"
He grinned. "Delicious. Now let me finish, then you can thrash me at this insanity I see before me"
"Yes, yes, oui oui, wee monsieur *Avoido*, get to your point"
"So, besides the valid critique of Patriarchal norms that the Drone Bee genome represents as a symbol, it also fundamentally underpins the paradoxical *need* for hierarchy within self-sustaining, generative systems of holistic animacy"
"The role of a stone gathers no Moss, you might say"
"You might indeed. What's even *more* interesting is the epigenome, and how histone modifications, DNA methylation and suchlike, shaped by the pheromonal cues from the Bee's environment, in turn feeds back, and shapes the epigenetic changes in future generations. Crucially, the point I'm making here is that even beyond the 'script' the Bees, and we, are given at birth, are in a dynamic dance with the experiences we grow into. Our stories are not just written for us, we have a very important, collaborative role in writing them-"
"How very trans."
With a joyful twinkle, he agreed: 
"*Very.*" The two of them shared a single second that stretched into eternity; like the tunnel created by two mirrors facing one another. 
"Anyway that's it. Your move. Oh! What's your name?"
She guffawed. "Selena"
"Lovely. I'm Myo" as he went to shake her hand-
"Sorry, I don't do touch"
"Apologies! My mistake" he said, not at all offended. 

"Right so now we've laid out all the problems with the Hierarchical Puzzle of this world, I give you, my solution:" she dramatically announced, gesturing like a Ringmaster at the beginning of her Travelling Circus's show
"First off, Bughouse Chess is usually played in teams. But-"
"Lemme guess; you don't do teams"
"Exactly. Too much noise."
"And there's only One Queen, after all"
With a sharp, well-trained tongue pop, she replied: "Now you're getting it, laddie"

Clearly being careful to avoid touching him (he moved a little back to allow for this), she moved over to his side of the table, and started to explain the setup. 
Her invention, now patented, included the specially made board (she'd gone through hell perfecting the 3D print). It was two, 9x9 grid, Hexagonal Chess boards, each with a concave curvature, placed back to back, giving the silhouette of an hourglass, or a butterfly, when viewed in profile. 
"So, this outer ring is where the Worker Pawns go"
"Nice--" Myo started to add
"Sh, it's my turn"
He made a playful 'zipping' gesture over his lips. 
"Then, the middle rings of hexagons are for the canonical non-pawn pieces, also Workers"- she started to click his Worker pieces into place
"In *Hivehouse*, you get to choose where the pieces go, and your decisions of placement are part of the strategy. Much like *Battleship*, part of the game lies in its almost Hermetically sealed secrecy between the opponents' pieces positions. So I would strongly suggest that you move them from these Hexagons I'm putting them in to explain. Because I will remember."
She then picked up the Nine, winged pieces with cruciform antennae-
"In this Chess variant, there are Nine Kings." She placed them in a circle around the central Hexagon.
"And, as you rightly pointed out, only One Queen"
With this, she clicked the Queen Bee into place, bang in the central Hexagon, which was the only transparent part of the structure. 
"Seeing as the Queen always starts in the centre, there's no need to hide her position. She isn't limited in her movement, just like in canonical Chess, but the transparency of the square provides some balance to the game's mechanics, in that, her absence will immediately be known by your opponent."
"Just like a Bee Colony"
"Exactly! You're a fast learner" - He offered an ironic salute.
"So these Nine Kings, or Drones, can still only move one Hexagonal space at a time. Have you ever played normal Hexagonal Chess?"
"Once, during Undergrad--"
"Okay good. Then I don't need to explain the rudimentary mechanics"
He stayed quiet, not wanting to appear *entirely* incompetent (the truth was, he couldn't for the life of him remember, but it wasn't like he was going to win anyway)
"In Bughouse, which is usually a collaborative game, any captured piece is placed on your teammates board. But you can also play the game solo, sort of like a more sophisticated, chaotic *Solitaire*. So *Hivehouse* sort of combines these games, with, as I mentioned, the basic premise of *Battleship.* You need to, throughout the early game, build an idea of where my Worker pieces might be placed, and retain that in memory. Then, as you take off your hand from your piece upon making a move, my board will light up on the corresponding square. If there's a piece there, I hand it to you, and you deploy it on your Hive. Make sense?"
"Uh... I'm sure I'll get the hang of it" He said, entirely aware that he wouldn't. 

--

Around an hour into their match, when his entire lab had gone home, and the Hall was all but empty, the unthinkable happened. 

They were almost at the end game, and both of them were reasonably surprised at how long Myo had managed to hang on. He was left with Two of his (Yellow) kings and One of hers (Burgundy). She still had Eight of hers, as well as the Seven that he'd unwittingly sacrificed. It was by entirely dumb luck that he'd even managed to capture one, and by this point, he was just randomly placing pieces - but out of respect for her truly masterful invention, he really *was* trying to keep up. 

He'd just placed his Worker Bishop in the top left quadrant of the middle ring of his board, capturing her Worker Rook (again, entirely by chance). Rapt by the pivotal final moments of her Special Interest, she'd stopped paying so much attention to the space between them. As she handed over the piece, not taking her eyes from her Hive, their hands brushed against one another. 

And then, for both of them, for the first time in either of their lives, came the most cacophonous 
*silence.*

Both of them jumped backward from their chairs, sending them, and the entire structure of pieces, clattering upon the floor. 

"What the *fuck*?" they both said, in unison, and then:
"*What?*" wondering what the other had meant--

"I--"
"I can't--"

The truth was, that both of them had been hiding, since they were old enough to know what hiding was. 
Both of them had a certain idiosyncratic gift. 
Selena's gift, which was activated through the tactile tense, afforded her the ability to gain an object, or person's, history, as long as this information was necessary to be revealed, either for her or for the person she was touching. 
For Myo, whose primary modality of experience was through his visual sense, had the ability to foresee causal clouds, stretching out in front of him. 
These 'gifts', as gifts often are, were an incessant burden to each of them. And both of them had kept them locked, out of sight, from anyone, including their parents. 
Even in this society, where the ubiquitous diviagnosis of neuroBeacons had entirely shifted the People's perspective of what was previously known and pathologised, in anteAntiquity, as 'neurodivergence'; even amidst this cultural landscape, their 'abilities' were unheard of. As such, the two of them had been terrified of even mentioning them to anyone. 

But the moment their skin came into contact, 
All the noise, all the futures, all the history, 
converged into a blissful silence, that neither of them had ever experienced. 


And that was it. 
Then, both of them knew, 
Drones in this incessantly buzing hive;
They simply had no choice- 

And there, amidst the scattered pieces, 
The two shattered domes, once laboured over by Selena, for so many countless hours, 
The Sun now sunken, both of their dicks decidedly *not* so; 
They started to tear off each others clothes.

# THE LAB CODEX OF MYO ENDIVE

THE LAB CODEX OF MYO ENDIVE
Myo clicked his noise-cancelling implant to 'Total Silence' (which of course, given his highly networked brain, could never really be *totally* silent, but at least it wasn't added to by the incessant stream of external, empirical resonance data). 

He was at his bench in The Lab, opening the very-loved-and-therefore-almost-falling-apart-at-the-spine Book that he termed his "Lab codex", once yellow, now a shimmering Gold, his still-all-too-human-yet-Yellow-Labrador-boyfriend-archetype-esque essential oils gradually exposing the Mnemanuscript circuitry underneath as water erodes a stone.

He had, as a child, been 'diagnosed' with a 'condition'[^condition], still undocumented in any other individual as he reached his Second Third of life (which, as you and I both know, does not necessarily mean he was the only person with the 'condition'). 

The 'condition' was known as Heisenberg's Prognostication Syndrome (HPS), but Myo preferred his own term "Schröharbinger's Un-insight", which certainly provided a comedic, Thalia-to-Melpomene contrast to Selena's much more characteristically mystical description of "quantum prophecy". In layperson's terms, Myo could perceive, or rather had no choice but to perceive, every given outcome of every choice he made, without ever knowing which would occur following said choice. He often thanked whatever archetypal (or, as Selena might frame it, ancestral) forces prevented him from seeing the outcome of anyone *else's*, as he was sure that would be an even more torturous Hell, far beyond the Gates[^Gate] of Hades[^Hades] he found himself in.

His "Dis[^Dis]-Arrays[^array]", as he termed them (causal clouds of potential, observed as synaesthetic forking paths), were similar to the 'trails' of presently-manifest empirical bodies moving through space (like the 'open shutter' movement of his hand caressing his beloved's face, naked under a Full Moon, the night before she left), that he had observed during his many psychedelic trips with Selena; resembling the individual frames of a motion picture, frozen in space long enough for the subject to see them, 'trailing' behind the moving Body in question. Only (though perhaps, not solely) in Myo's case, the 'trails' stretched 'forward' in phenomenological space, into higher dimensions than just the Third. 

He wondered, in his welcomed sonic (but not causal) silence, if[^if] he should open his EdeniaStudio IDE[^IDE] or his email, and send Selena an update. His very wondering, of course, splintering into countably infinite 'fast-forward frames (FFF)', which he immediately shook off by landing on the (unbeknownst to him, inevitable) 'decision' of his daily email checkin. Of course, this very decision, while collapsing the 'previous' FFFs (like melted wax wings of a well-intentioned boy who approached the Sun too intimately), erupted another dis-array of FFFs (dancing out of his body like the Spinneret-woven silk of a Spider who just wanted to spin beauty out of her forever).

Then came another tumultuous decision fork, as he tried to think of the best 'move' in their ongoing email game of '*Prologuemania*', in which they would open the bodies of their emails with a quote from a Body of work that felt moving to them in that moment. Opening his email to find another of her snapshots, a frozen frame of the motion picture that was their love, that they were collaboratively writing together, through this immeasurably measurable distance, was the highlight of his day. 

He decided to go with a verse from Vladimir Nabokov's *Pale Fire*

date: XVII_XXIII_ERA_Æ


“I was the shadow of the waxwing slain  
By the false azure in the windowpane;  
I was the smudge of ashen fluff -and I  
Lived on, flew on, in the reflected sky."
-Nabokov


My Light S,

Checking in. Yes, of course I want to know how the Alephic Grimoire is holding up (sincerely hope its allowing you to record rituals with the appropriately nested chaos you envisioned), but the subject of this email refers to you and our little Peri-bean-

How are you (both)? Help me collapse this cacophony of email response FFFs that I'm desperately trying to ignore enough to see through them as I type? Really, which ever psychologist in antiquity came up with the term 'catastrophisation' had NO idea just how catastrophic the spectra of potentialities of every given choice are, FFS.

Thinking about you every nanosecond of every moment. As much as I loved our holographiversary, not being able to celebrate our Third year together as the Three of us for the first time was really quite heartbreaking. Gosh I must stop gushing I'm crying in the Lab again--

Still squirrelling away with the Byron{if|or}matic analysis of Phage23 samples, obviously, but I'm struggling to keep up with all these cases Flooding (eep, Biblical pun definitely not intended) in. As always, my bottleneck lies in *communicating* my ideas well enough to fucking delegate this mammoth task - wish I had you here to translate (DNA pun definitely intended).

I love you both so much and miss you like a yet-to-be-ligated daughter antiSense strand of DNA. Everything is antiSense without you here. 




He went to click 'Send', before a particularly violent FFF of a potential response (not from Selena. From some other Body that could, in the endless Library of potentialities, be writing the story their motion picture was adapted fro--), no matter how unlikely, forced him to reconsider his choice of Nabokov quote. 

Still wanting to honour his initial desire to honour the incredible Russian novelist-poet (and, more importantly, Entomologist; or, more specifically, and even more importantly, Lepidopterist[^lepidos]) he deleted his email 'foreword' and replaced it with another collection of characters from *Pale Fire*:

~~*"The sea is a thief: it dissolves the moon.”*~~

No, no, he thought - that's far too dire, given the circumstances. So he tried another Nabokovian move:

“All colors made me happy: even Gray.  
My eyes were such that literally they  
Took photographs. ”

Good thing I made these revisions, he thought- *I almost forgot the email signature-*


*O, Lustrous-stillness-shadow-cradled-light, round-airy-light-on-dark, tremulous-orbit-of-night’s-warmth, gentle-pull-of-cedar’s-resin-tincture,*

-M


After one last glimpse at his initial, a pictograph of two archways, both the start of the word 'Mirror' and a perfect symbolic representation of the symmetry a mirror invokes, or, M could be for 'More', as in, more importantly: the wings of a lepidopteran[^lepidos], or, equally, the sound of some Body pondering over their writing-

He sent the email, and went back to work.


[^condition]: A condition is something essential to the appearance or occurrence of something else, especially an environmental requirement. For example, _Myo’s happiness was conditional on the occurrence of a daily call with Selena in the midst of this Pandemic madness_ or[^OR] _The condition for the Earth to maintain equilibrium in its tides is intricately linked to its distance from the Moon; as She draws closer, tidal forces grow stronger, promising catastrophic flooding and ecological imbalance._
[^OR]:in many programming languages, a logical OR gate is denoted by a **double pipe** (||), but[^&&!] not[^NOT] python.
[^NOT]:In many programming languages, the **NOT** operation is denoted by a **bang**[^bang] (!), e.g. if (!condition) {// Executes if condition is false}, but not[^NOT] python.
[^&&!]:The **BUT** logic gate isn’t a standard logic gate like AND[^AND], OR[^OR], or NOT[^Gnot], but its functionality can be understood as a conditional (see footnote (1): *conditional*) relationship[^relationship], which may || may not be written as A &&! B, meaning _A occurs and B explicitly does not occur_.
[^bang]:to make a loud and sudden noise.[^noise]  
[^AND]:A double ampersand[^amper] is used in many programming languages to denote the 'AND' Logic Gate.
[^amper]:An ampersand is a symbol which would almost resemble an infinity symbol rotated like an hourglass, if it weren't rendered, through its openness, more like a serpent, Gnotting[^Gnot] over itself, attempting, and not quite achieving, the illusion of an infinity symbol.
[^Gnot]:Gnot (not) !NOT
[^if]:The Logic Gate 'if' can also be expressed in other ways. For example, in JavaScript, conditional logic may be applied through the 'switch'[^switch] statement. 
[^switch]:In kink practices such as S&M, a person who feels comfortable performing (dominant||submissive) roles. 
[^IDE]: IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment, a software application that helps programmers develop code efficiently. || The term "Ides" comes from the Latin word iduare, which means "to divide". In the Roman calendar of antiquity, the Ides marked the rise of the full moon in the middle of the month. || Another term for 'Orfe' [^ORF] a silvery freshwater fish belonging to the carp[^carp] family.
[^carp]:A particular fish that, against all efforts otherwise, often feels lonely. 
[^ORF]: !to be confused with ORF, which stands for Open Reading Frame; the term for the length of DNA which is transcribed into RNA for eventual translation into a protein. 
[^lepidos]: The study of butterflies and moths (lepidopterans), and the Field's name (lepidoptery), derive from the ancient-ancient Greek *lepidos*, which means 'scale', given their wings coverage in tiny scales, overlapping as tiles on a roof. 
[^Gate]:Logic gates are drawn with a symbol showing the input (or inputs) and the output. Inputs are usually drawn on the left (or top[^top]) and outputs on the right (or bottom). A logic gate is the simplest form of a digital switch[^switch]
[^noise]:For example, *The other members of The Team were banging their equipment around in a way that disturbed Myo's sensory hypersensitivities*, |[^contact]
[^contact]:I to come into contact with something: often unexpectedly. For example, *Myo was about to bang into a world-changing discovery that had implications far outreaching both his specialist Fields of Byron{if|or}matics and Aesthetic Hermeneutics*, |[^hair]
[^hair]:| In hairdressing || in The story of Samson and Delilah: to cut hair in a style that hangs over the forehead, or in its noun sense, the resulting style from such a cosmetological manoeuvre. For example *Before she left on her pilgrimage to the Outer-Ouro-Hebrides, Myo lovingly banged Selena's hair into a striking bang, which had now grown over her eyebrows in a way he found endearing*, I[^OOO]
[^OOO]:| In an adverbial sense, precisely, exactly right. For example Myo had been banging his head against a wall over his research only to realise his years of toiling against the bureaucratic clergy that academic Science had become that he was slap bang in the middle of his destiny, amidst colleagues whose insensitive banging-about was bang out of order |[^tender]
[^tender]:| In its vulgar, therefore beautifully tender definition, to have sex with someone. For example *The last time they saw each other in person, immediately after he had trimmed her hair into a chic bang, Selena banged Myon for the first time in their three years together as partners, cementing not only a devotional act of vulnerability on his part (he had never bottomed before), but moreso on hers, as it evidenced her sheer level of comfort in her gender identity in his presence (she had never topped before), enough to perform a sexual act so wrongfully attributed as 'masculine'*.
[^array]: An **array** is a data structure that holds multiple values, each accessed by its index.[^index]
[^Dis]: Dis is the crudely not-quite Roman equivalent of the Greek god Hades.[^Hades]
[^index]:"Index finger" literally means "pointing finger", from the same Latin source as 'indicate'[^indicate]. In python23 ([^BUTNOT]), arrays are 'zero-indexed', that is to say, elements in an array are numbered starting from '0'; which can be quite confusing[^0th]  
[^Hades]: Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? || hast thou seen the gates of Hades?- Job 38:17[^17]
[^17]:Seventeen is the Number of The Star in the Twenty Three Cards of The Gnoeneomajor Arcana, Myo's favourite Tarot card (much to Selena's surprise; and the topic of discussion during their first date, where Selena had won their first (and last) game of Hexagonal Chess, which was not at all surprising to either of them).
[^indicate]:Early-Early ~17th[^17] Century (though, we cannot be sure) Latin "in-" (towards) && "-dicare" (make known) i.e. *With every motion of Myo's phalangeal member of index distinction, countably infinite, entomoid movements stretched out in front of him, like his own, personal, holographic Kronenberg movie, with him as the lonely protagonist && sole audience member*.
[^relationship]:Three Years, Two Months, One Day. Three People, Once Two, One Family.
[^BUTNOT]:&&![^&&!] The Twenty Three other programming[^FORTRAN] languages (at the time of compiling) where the array[^array] index starts from 1.

[^top]: In genomics, the **top strand** refers to the DNA strand that runs in the 5’ to 3’ direction, often used as a reference in genetic sequences. It serves as the template for the complementary **bottom[^bottom] strand**, which runs in the opposite 3’ to 5’ direction, much like the balance of opposing forces necessary for the transcription of life itself. || In kink practices, a **top** refers to the dominant or active participant in an interaction, the one who takes the lead or initiates action. As Myo once joked with Selena, “If I’m the top strand, does that mean you’re transcribing me, or are you just flipping me over into complementary submission?”[^topasbottom]

# THE GRIMOIRE OF SELENA ELK

Dear Dis, Cernunnos, Baphomet, whoever it is that I came from -

It's been Twenty Three days. 
Only Twenty Three. 
And she's back. 
I'm terrified. I'm absolutely terrified. All my life I have wanted to find an explanation for the unexplainable phenomena that have surrounded me, some sort of clue, a thread of evidential proof, that I wasn't fucking crazy-
And here, here She is, giving me proof, with no explanation.
I don't want to tell Myo; but I know I have to, he might be the only one who can provide some sort of empirical framework for this far-beyond-and-yet-within force that has been pulling me here, that has pulled me here to pull her so NEAR. 

Like the wind on the leaves, I know he's already seen the effect my magick has had on her, I bet the Team are going batshit trying to deal with The Outbreak on top of trying to figure out what's brought her orbit closer (after some brief searches of the Journals, in spite of myself and my resistance to even attempting to cross those triple-loched intellectual paywalls to get to our archives of knowledge, I realise it must be a change in the lunar distance causing these simultaneous "Plagues" and Floods that DNE in their incessant need for Heirophantine, Formalised Religiosity are bent on ascribing to the Phage, and to some Ancient "One God" they call the Tetra-grammar Tohn... I am, for once, finding myself wishing that I *didn't* feel the validity of my own magick's involvement in the phenomenological world).

I came here to find a way out, or, as is always the case, I came here to find a way in-

I found both, and her reflection is screaming the answer, her reflection of my reflection is offering nothing but a clattering howl that she draws out of me every night when I first see her face, 
Always coming back, always coming back, 
through all the leaving, through all the rot of all the leaves - she always comes back. 
And now, through what I've done, through what I truly, Dear Dis, Dear long forgotten Pantheon, Dear Goddess please forgive me, I wanted to know too much, I wanted to know you, through perhaps, finally, knowing me.

I think of Icarus, that sweet, misunderstood boy, who I know Myo must be descendent from, as I in counterpoint am descendent from Arachne 

Goddess, how exactly identically opposite we are. 
I have to tell him. I have to- 

First, a ritual. Always, ritual before anything. Ritual inside of and above everything. A ritual inside a ritual inside a life of ritual. 

I turn my Grimoire, this Grimoire, into an Aleph, by turning to the previous page and unfolding the extra dimension I keep hidden inside and on top of the Mnemanuscript (so lovingly crafted by Myo, Oh Goddess I really must tell him- but first-)


![[The Firsted Last Ritual]]

Having spliced in the parts that I believe are, or were, or will be missing, I decide it's time to send him an email 



date: XVII_XXIII_ERA_Æ  


My Light M,
	
	*"At first, I was going to say how sorry and in pain I feel for the people throughout history who've not had this device that I have with AI that we all have at our fingertips and eyelashes now, the ability of machine learning algorithms to regurgitate and remember and retain and give back the entire history of the library, infinite library of human recorded information, no matter how warped it may be by its own light, but actually that is the very thing, that's the very thing that's led to the separation which has prevented us from being able to get there in the very paradoxical, which is the only true sense, the fact that we have all this infinity at our fingertips means that we can't find that one book, that one book that was perhaps what everything was made from in the oldest times, was the only book they had, that was the only book they had, so at once they were living it but not separated from it enough to actually perceive it, so they took it for granted in their own way, just as we take for granted the opposite, the chance and the question to be lost."*

*-Noet. Borges (sorry!!!!!!*)†


†I know you find him self-important and somewhat pretentious in his recursive fiction, but I was reading the latest Gnoeneoeng. translation of The Citadel of Tohms last night and I thought it was the perfect fit for today's *Prologuemania - hope you will forgive me for (finally!!!) taking up our little email opening ritual with the Noet. who is perhaps the one artist we disagree on the genius of (although, I look forward to uncovering, or not, the smatterings of whatever the Two (soon to be Three!!!!!) of us disagree on. Or agree on. I look forward to it all. Dear Goddess how I miss your smell, My Light)


Last night, I am certain of it, I felt them 'kick', or whatever their version of 'kick' might be (I know I can look it up in a second, but your Gnoeneogenomic andBryon{if|or}matic facts are the closest thing I have to you reading to me here - can you let me know what developmental stage Perigee would be at right now? And as always, I *need* the associated Bryon{if|or}matic Symbology)

I hope hearing/reading this provides a sense of catharsis, rather than a pang of pain. As I write this I realise it will most likely be both. It's always both, as we say.

How's the sample analysis going? I just know you're knocking their socks off. I have a very strong one of my "feelings" as you so lovingly term them, that it will be you, my Light, who saves us all from this terrifying Phage. 

Also, please could we have our daily call a little earlier today, if you have the time, completely understand if you can't pull it forward, or even need to cancel (don't worry, I know how much our calls mean to you). The work you're doing, even from a purely quantifiable basis (really speaking your language now, eh?) is absolutely paramount. 

Hope the code is coding kindly dear light,



*Forever, upward moonating, toward the tidal-pulling, beautywards,*
