permalink: An open letter to JK Rowling

The gift I grew up with 
I never fucking asked for 
Would have waived my wand away 
And I probably would have spoken up more 
And fought for myself 
And had fun with my little masculinity
If I’d been a girl in everyone else’s eyes 
I came to terms when I came to term 
An unadjourning yearning cage
Young age a wage I was plagued to earn
Swallowing secrets, psych meds, celery, sperm 
In the yawning Mourning of The Before Times 
In the Afterward of what I’d let become 
The Stretching
and Sweeping 
inducing overproduced cliché –
Catching glimpses of the mythology 
Of the someone 
I might stand to be 
And standing here now, 
That’s what I’m doing 
Reading and learning and unlearning and hating every fucking thing that’s ever come out of my mouth that I’ve let be carved into my heart but trying 
And trying 
And still trying 
not to die 
Cutting out my guts on the internet 
Instead of cutting my wrists
And there’s this demented cheerleader 
In my head, relentless clenching of her fists
Screaming at some canine-perceptible frequency
The worth of the danger of being seen 
The Earth a stranger, its ‘mud’ PRISTINE
Infinitesimal nipples and the rest of the ripples
Echoes of the Man you see – 
I Am 
Not He.
My penis is not my privilege 
And I’m sick of pseudofeminists
Cystic tryst of misogynists 
Who are still somehow stuck on this 
Patriarchal darkle of taking a piss 
The same shit that hisses, 
Wishes
you were Cis  
But Passing is assimilation, sis
A woman IS
so much more than 
Menstruation 
I thought you fought
for all of our bodies 
but now I’m caught
in the claws of your untaught philosophy 
where the worth of a girl unfurls from her ovaries
You share the same brain 
As the Man you call your enemy 
Who tells me, and I quote (as much as it hurts me): 
‘Maybe 
That’s Why No-one Likes Tr*****s
Because They Get So Fucking Angry
Every Time They Speak”
And I used to stay QUIET
For fear of proving you RIGHT
And Worked my Body to the Ground
To think like a Pink droplet of Ink 
in a Churn of milk from a factory vat 
And honestly, 
What could be
More Feminine Than That?
We are what we read 
And Wizardry, I didn’t need 
I Was Already A Witch 
And they dubbed me a queen 
insidious, byzantine 
hateful gatekeepers of femininity 
Who On Earth are you to Police
the secretions of a woman’s body?
trussed and stuffed, a centrepiece 
For all the Tigers C*ming to T
And Besides, 
(Really - listen to me)
You’ll NEVER see
How MUCH
I bleed
