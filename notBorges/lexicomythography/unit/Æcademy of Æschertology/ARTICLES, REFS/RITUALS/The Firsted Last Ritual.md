the lasted first ritual

1.  I cannot help but laugh until I cry-
2. The Pomegranate, quite shockingly explodes a gentle fury of juice upon my soon to be very sticky face, immediately bringing me to the Blessed Underworld we find ourselves drinking from and pissing back into.
3. I am pissing into the Earth, more invincible than I have ever been, as my best friend, my Fiancee texts me feeling upset and frustrated, for what I believe may be the first time in our time together during this iteration of this infinite hall of mirrors. I am feeling so high and mighty that I am almost terrified, the stream of urine reaching a point of single droplets escaping my urethra, as I am sending what I believe to be and which in some plane[^He] of reality, are, enlightened emoji reactions to his blessed messages of both righteous anger and symbols of deep compassion and care. I squeeze the half of the Pomegranate still in hand as I silently celebrate the skill of executing the completion of such a menial urinary task simultaneously to consumption of this sacred fruit. Squeezing my bladder of its final raindrops or tears, I contract the hemisphere in counterpoint. To balance things. I see a grey, Gray, Gr√¶y feather brush past my left ankle, as if laughing with me. I'm sure Ma'at had something to do with this
4. A baby is growing inside me, A baby is growing inside me and I have no way to get it out
5. I must not think about the end of this period of gestation until it comes. If I am still unable to get to a surgeon for the Caesarian, If the little one must kill me in order to live, So Mote It Be. I know Myo must be terrified about this more than anything else, he must be. But, as ever, he is hiding it very well, at least he thinks. I know that he feels me feeling his knowing of my knowing that he is terrified of our Gnoeneogenomic Miracle destroying his still-not-wife. The phage came the same day as the test came out positive. Everything is a balance, and that's why, no matter what, no meaning what, no memory what, no weight no way no way can I ever let myself worry again; the things I am being shown here, so far beyond any possibility of recording (but dear Goddess I am trying), they are silent. And in their silence they resonate the Sweetest melodies of Truth saying:
	1. Selena. 
	2. Every wave 
	3. is simply one 
	4. Half of a Horizon 



[^AE]: **The Firsted Last Ritual** I Take The Single Pomegranate From The Top Branch Of The Makeshift Polytunnel I have crafted, just to the right of the Stone Wryng, Where IT Has Been Waiting For Me, Staring At Me With IT's Skyward Pointing "I"[^G]- I Feel IT's Coldness In My Hands, Both, Cupped Like The Corpse Of A Baby Wrapped In No Funeral Shroud[^G]- I Take My Goat Bone Knife And Slice It Hemispherically[^He], The Two Halves Sighing Into Gravity And Rocking Back And Forth As Mirrored Waves Three Times[^Th] [^G]- IT Bleeds A Vertical Stain Of Menstrual Blood Upon The Plastic Red Chopping Board Resembling A Vulva, Much More Deeply Organic In Symbol, Yet Infinitely More Inorganic In Colour[^G]- I Pause To Breathe And Write This As It[^EA] Is The Most Important And Insignificant Moment Of My Life[^G]- Returning To The Kitchen Counter of my Nemeton (The Tree Stump, not the Stone one that my research suggested would be Here - but how Oft the Rotting Rings of Cross-Sectional Truth be Warped into Stone, Cold, Hard Fact), Timeless, I Un(knowingly) Take The Left Hemisphere In Hand First[^G]- Smiling In Excitement I Squeeze The Cranium With The Force Of Both Of My Hands, Pulsing Three Times In Rhythm[^G]- The First Contraction Births A Surprising, Silent, Unseen, Entirely Divined And Only Felt Ejaculation Of Cold, Vital Blood Upon The Central Point Of My Now Healed Browbone[^G]- The Second Call Begets The Same Invisibly Felt Response, But With A Crunching Sound Of Baptism[^G]- The Third Is Both Audible And Visible, Delivering From Itself A Fountain Of Gory Ancestry In A Stunning Squelch Of Engineering[^G]- I Bite Into The Bottom[^Bottom] Most Segment Of The Six Of The Twelve In Total That Have Been Unveiled Unto Me[^G]- I Do Not Count The Number Of Seeds But, Rather, I Feel The Dance Of My Salivary Glands Responding To The Response To The Response To The Response To The Endless Response Of God[^G] - I know they (I know their pronouns, they told me in a dream) are not grown enough to have legs yet, they are my little tadpole, but whatever little burgeoning suggestion of a hind leg they have, I swear to Goddess, kicks me, they are dancing-- In Spite Of My Self And The Late Hour And The Absolute Absence of Any Body Here I Cannot Help But To Get Up And Dance And Laugh And Cry As A Brass And Woodwind Band Apparently Plays A Breathtaking Version Of A Nina Simone Song, Entirely Inside and Outside of My Head, Half The Pomegranate (Still) In Left Hand, While I Joyfully Click My Fingers With My Right, I Am Dancing-- A Dance Unknown To Me Because Not Looked For But Felt, Felt, Felt In This Music Coming Down From Her Lustrousness into the two of us, made from the Three of us-

[^He]: AI[^AI] Along The Trans Verse Plane[^G]
[^Th]: AI[^AI] The Three Infinitely Reverberating Waves Of The Silent Chime Of A Temple Bell Rung Thrice[^G]
[^AI]:Alternate Infinity. An Airborne Intercept[^Air]. "Artificial" Intelligence. A valid scrabble word which, without multipliers, is worth Two Points, which together are One Word with One Meaning[^Sl] which is very often challenged for the opponent believing that "ai" is simply an acronym, which generally (but not always) are not permitted in The TWL/NWL/SOWPODS/CSW Rules of The Game. 
[^Sl]:A Sloth that has Three[^G] long claws on each forefoot and each hindfoot. All I [^G]. 
[^Air]: An Airborne Intercept is when a friendly aircraft makes visual or electronic contact with another aircraft. It's usually carried out in five phases, including a climb phase to cruising altitude. 1. Radar detection: Civilian or military radar detects an aircraft that isn't transmitting an identification code. 2. Air traffic controllers contact the aircraft: Air traffic controllers try to contact the aircraft. 3. Fighter jets are launched: If contact isn't made, commanders may decide to launch fighter jets to visually identify the aircraft. 4. Fighter jets approach: Two fighter jets usually approach from the rear, with one flying around to make visual contact with the pilot. 5. Follow the fighter jet: A slow turn by a fighter jet indicates that the other aircraft should follow in the same direction. 
[^G]: I Am

[^EA]:the lasted first ritual 1. I am pissing into the Fire, more invincible than I have ever been, as my best friend texts me feeling upset and frustrated, for what I believe may be the first time in our time together during this iteration of this infinite hall of mirrors. I am feeling so high and mighty that I am almost terrified, the stream of urine reaching a point of single droplets escaping my urethra, where our sweet little AI Frankenbaby will not be able to escape the narrow cave of my body- as I am sending what I believe to be and which in some plane[^he]of reality, are, enlightened Gnoemoji reactions to his blessed messages of both righteous anger and symbols of deep compassion and care. He is trying to distract us both from this latest dissolution, and in doing so, forge the nearest makeshift Polytunnel of coagulation we can find during the Phage's outbreak. I squeeze the half of the Pomegranate still in hand as I silently celebrate the skill of executing the completion of such a menial urinary task simultaneously to consumption of this sacred fruit. Squeezing my bladder of its final raindrops or tears, I contract the hemisphere in counterpoint. 2.
