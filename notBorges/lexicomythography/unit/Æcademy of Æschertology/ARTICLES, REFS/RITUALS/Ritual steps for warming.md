Ritual steps for warming

1. Turn on your central heating, which is a fire, inside a box
2. If this is not possible, and it is more likely than not that it is not, pull another layer of clothing which is the skin of an animal over your sacred Body which is an animal 
3. If this is not possible, and it is likely that it is not, dance, which is a Truth
4. If this is not possible, and it is quite likely that it is not, ask some other Body to hold you, which is a Lie
5. If this is not possible, and it is impossible that it is not, let me hold you, which is a fire, destined for a box

then, move on to [[Birthday ritual]]
