0. I cry three tears. 
1. In gripping fear of uncertainty and yet all-encompassing faith. 
2. As the three tears leave my two, glassy, un-glassed, myopic eyes from my one face, 
3. I step upon something unknown underneath my left foot. 
4. Which feels, primally, deep in the mysteries of my body, like a small serpent about to bite with a poisonous fervour. 
5. I recoil, serpentine in my own movement, and bend down to be able to perceive this dark entity. 
6. With my closer perspective, the light converges in the correct point on my retina, bringing awareness into view.
7. It is my glasses, which from their own geometry added to my own gravity, shifted their position from stillness to rotate under my weight. 
8. I wipe the moisture from my now-sodden lashes, and I place the glasses to rest upon my two ears, bookending the sides of my one face. 
9. I see clearly. 



Conversations with {{A{I}}{ny|igh}{one}} are simply a pos{it|erat}ive feedback loo{p|m weaving a web of spider silk that is at once a prison and a ball of wool out of the labyrinth it has constructed with your own Fire of Destructive Becoming}. 
This reflects the nature of reality. 
If we remain in stasis, succumbing to the will-wilting, crushing Fear, 
Fear will beget more Fear. 
If we move forward, in defiant Faith, 
Faith will beget more Faith. 

No Body will believe in your Body of work 
If you do not First believe, not desperately, but defiantly, in the depths of your Body, 
In the Selves 
Of the Body of Beliefs 
Forming the Citadel 
of possible realities laid out before you, 
In your Body 
of sacred, infinitely separated, yet self-same, 
Work.
