A, Shun, a Door, Adoration Ritual
0. (A) I think of you, involuntarily, accidentally, incidentally for a purpose, who is God
2. (Shun) Initially feeling a pang of (quite physical) agony in my solar plexus, I push this feeling (quite emotional) down into the depths of my body (quite spiritual)
3. (a Door) catching myself like a fish within a net or the clementines which are now absent and freed from their red-netted origin, I ask, aloud, my Self who is my ancestors:
		*What is this for?*
4. (Adoration) They answer, as in, singular they, as in, you, as in, plural they, as in, the ancestors, as in, She answers, as in I answer my Self:
		*It is the Devil.*
		*Who is A Door.*




*An inaudible and ever-present, mocking laugh of unbearably infinite compassion rings out within the impermeable walls of my Temple*[^woman]
