RITUAL OF THE TIRED SYRINGE
1. observe the plastic syringe resting on the reflective surface of a mirrored plate intended for displaying tea-light candles, once containing morphine, and then emptied into your needful mouth by your once loving partner during the greatest period of pain of your life so far, then filled with morphine again, then emptied again into the same space by the same partner to become absorbed by your Body, and then again filled by the same now tired partner but then again perhaps always tired in their emptying love for you, and then half-emptied again clumsily by your shaking opiate-drunk fingers as they had to rush out for some unknown engagement, and then filled again in their absence, and then countless times again emptied into your mouth holding teeth that are precariously hanging onto their roots, and then haphazardly filled again by your not-self at some point you can't really remember, and then emptied into your mouth now bereaved of another tooth, and then filled again by you with burgundy, dark-blood red ink to create ritualistic artworks destined to have holes burned in them to mirror the space in your gums and home and heart, and then emptied again and again onto canvases that feel like the roughness of your skin, and then again and again and again emptied, and then again emptied, and then again emptied, take the syringe and without another thought throw it in the bin, and then again observe the empty space
