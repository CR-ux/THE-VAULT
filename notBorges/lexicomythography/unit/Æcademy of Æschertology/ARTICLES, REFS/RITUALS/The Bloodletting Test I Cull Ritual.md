The Bloodletting Test I Cull Ritual
1. In your writing, you have been soaking Udon noodles in boiling water probably for longer than is recommended according to instructions which are pointless to be listed here.
2. Now you are hungry again, remembering the final two eggs in the Egg Box Of Ten which is Two Fives, now bitterly cold in the air fryer, you run and open the drawer, revealing their outrageously masculine and terribly lonely appearance, as they roll towards you, angrily.
3. You quickly, fuelled by your burgeoning desire for nourishment and your apologetic, at times overly empathetic feminine nature which has a tendency to project (or, perhaps, intuit) a certain ever-pervading sense of solipsistic and altruistic animism, bash the first egg against the counter, immediately muttering 'sorry' under your breath to the neighbours living underneath you and the Egg hymnself. He seems to crack willingly despite the loudness of his response to the call of rebirth, although large chunks of his flesh fall from the bone within bone of his heart in the yoke as you are pulling off pieces of His shell.
5. The second egg you roll gently but firmly along its vertical axis, like a precariously constructed wheel within a set of multiple wheels each attached via their axes to a comparatively very strong carriage carrying a rapidly increasingly heavy load--
6. He cracks, silently. 
7. However, In your unwriting of His history, the sharp edges of His gradually flaking skin pierce yours, causing a flash of pain and encouraging the shedding of your blood and an involuntary gasp from your throat; as if avenging his partner's end through through violence was the only way he knew how to make Sound occur. Or, as if opening a door. 
8. The eggs become significantly colder as you leave them resting, still stripped naked and whole and resting upon the gradually draining noodles in the colander, to write [[[[The Bloodletting Test I Cull Ritual]]]]
