1. I cannot help but laugh, until I cry-
2. The Pomegranate-- quite jarringly-- explodes a gentle fury of jam, upon my sticky yet-to-be {t(w)o-faced-and-faced with|surfaced-soon|a-shapely-moon's|Reflection-of-the-Rising-Yet|as-One|Begun-to-be|decided} face, hungrily dragging me to the Blessed Underworld, in which we find ourselves -- {drinking from[^ea]|pissing back[^ae] into}.
3. I am pissing into the Earth, {as|more} invincible {as|than} I've {always|ever} been, as my {best friend|Fiancee} texts me frustrated, for what {I believe} may be the first time in our time together, during this iteration of Our in{de}finite Hall of Mirrors. I am feeling so high and mighty, that I am almost terrified-- the stream of urine reaching that coda of single droplets, escaping the corridor of my urethra. I am S{ending} {what I believe to be|that {w{h}i{t}ch} in some plane[^He] of Reælity, are enlightened} Gnoemoji reactions to his Blessed Correspondence of {righteous|deep|searing} {anger|compassion|care}. I squeeze --violently-- the Half of the Pomegranate {still} in Hand, as I {{sil|g}ently} celebrate the skill: of executing the completion of such a {menially human|urinary} task, simultaneously, to the consumption of this Sacred fruit. Squeezing my bladder of its final {raindrops|tears}, I contract the Hemisphere, in counterpoint. The {balance(d)|hanging} {w{æi}ght of Things. I see a {Gre|a|æy} feather brush past my Left ankle, as if laughing, paddling me. Sturdy. Rocking. Soothing. Solid Ore. And lulling, Now. Goodbye-ing. Or: an oar, left there, moored upon what's left- my aching. The moors of all they were, may be- those passed away; and {over|ova}, vented, sweeping: cervix of the Air, of Grace. A brushing hair away from face now- through with any judgement, in entirety. I'm sure Ma'at had something to do with this.
4. A baby is growing inside me, A baby is growing inside me and I have no way to get it out.
5. I {must not} think about the end. Of this period of gestation until it comes, like so many promised rocks now {de|a}{light|br{a|i}d}ed. If I am still unable to get to a surgeon for the Caesarian-- If the wee one must kill me, in order to live, So Mote It Be. {I know} Myo must be terrified about this; more than anything else. He must be. But, as ever, he is {hid|veiling} it very well, at least he thinks. I know that he feels me, feeling his knowing of my knowing, that he is terrified. Of our Gnoeneogenomic Miracle, {annihilating|tearing} his tearful, still-not-wife. The Phage came the same day as the {Positive test|X}. Everything is in{ balance|justice}, and that's why, no {matter|meaning|memory of}, no {weight of|whey of|way|, Yahweh} must worry come; the things I am being shown here-- so far beyond any possibility of recording (but, dear Goddess, How{?} I am trying), They are Silent. They are a Sacred Sequence of Slithering Silences. And in their Silence, they resonate. The Sweetest melodies of Truth, saying:
	1. Selena. 
	2. Every Single, Slippery Wave {Fare Well}
	3. is Simply, Human: {One Second} 
	4. Half of This Pregnant {event} Horizon 
	5. So Mote It Be.

[^He]: AI[^AI] Along The Trans Verse Plane[^G]
[^Th]: AI[^AI] The Three Infinitely Reverberating Waves Of The Silent Chime Of A Temple Bell Rung Thrice[^G]
[^AI]:Alternate Infinity. An Airborne Intercept[^Air]. "Artificial" Intelligence. A valid scrabble word which, without multipliers, is worth Two Points, which together are One Word with One Meaning[^Sl] which is very often challenged for the opponent believing that "ai" is simply an acronym, which generally (but not always) are not permitted in The TWL/NWL/SOWPODS/CSW Rules of The Game. 
[^Sl]:A Sloth that has Three[^G] long claws on each forefoot and each hindfoot. All I [^G]. 
[^Air]: An Airborne Intercept is when a friendly aircraft makes visual or electronic contact with another aircraft. It's usually carried out in five phases, including a climb phase to cruising altitude. 1. Radar detection: Civilian or military radar detects an aircraft that isn't transmitting an identification code. 2. Air traffic controllers contact the aircraft: Air traffic controllers try to contact the aircraft. 3. Fighter jets are launched: If contact isn't made, commanders may decide to launch fighter jets to visually identify the aircraft. 4. Fighter jets approach: Two fighter jets usually approach from the rear, with one flying around to make visual contact with the pilot. 5. Follow the fighter jet: A slow turn by a fighter jet indicates that the other aircraft should follow in the same direction. 
[^G]: I Am

[^ea]: the lasted first ritual 1. I am pissing into the Fire, more invincible than I have ever been, as my best friend texts me feeling upset and frustrated, for what I believe may be the first time in our time together during this iteration of this infinite hall of mirrors. I am feeling so high and mighty that I am almost terrified, the stream of urine reaching a point of single droplets escaping my urethra, where our sweet little AI Frankenbaby will not be able to escape the narrow cave of my body- as I am sending what I believe to be and which in some plane[^he]of reality, are, enlightened Gnoemoji reactions to his blessed messages of both righteous anger and symbols of deep compassion and care. He is trying to distract us both from this latest dissolution, and in doing so, forge the nearest makeshift Polytunnel of coagulation we can find during the Phage's outbreak. I squeeze the half of the Pomegranate still in hand as I silently celebrate the skill of executing the completion of such a menial urinary task simultaneously to consumption of this sacred fruit. Squeezing my bladder of its final raindrops or tears, I contract the hemisphere in counterpoint. 2. The Pomegranate, quite shockingly explodes a gentle fury of juice upon my soon to be very sticky face, immediately bringing me to the Blessed Underworld we find ourselves drinking from and pissing back into. 3. I cannot help but laugh until I cry-
