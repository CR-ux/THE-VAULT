hardening-SOFTENING ritual

1. take out one box of Eggs (Ten in number, split into two Fives which are your Fingers and your Toes) from the coldness of the refrigerator 
2. with the label of the box facing away, as if the words are hiding from the light, open the lid toward you
3. reach for the top left symbol for life, the two rightmost rows being absent of Eggs (which, when viewed from the upright positioning, are also the leftmost)
4. realise the bottom left Egg has a small white feather presenting itself to you
5. smile in knowing and place the feather in the skyward-pointing fingers effigy of ineffable and insufficient approximation of Baphomet upon your altar
6. in one smooth, still motion, take out a pushpin from your stationæry draw
7. using the phage-like tail-needle of the pin, holding onto its plastic-proteinaceous head to provide the necessary resistance in connection, pierce the bottom curvature of the top-left acquired Egg
8. interrupted by Goddess herself in your ceremony, notice two flies on the screen of your window
9. use the now-crumpled card that bears the circular stave and memory of Kali Malone's organ recital in Glasgow Cathedral attended with your ex-partner the night before your final surgery in which you were put under anaesthesia from the canonical Organist who is not Kali Malone but an Anaesthesiologist who plays the organ on Sunday Service for love of the Divine, from which you awoke alone in personage but whole in insight, to attempt to free both of the flies through your now-opened window but accidentally kill one in the process, the other alighting this space quickly approaching the same temperature as the fridge
10. use the same action-in-inaction to pierce the upmost hemisphere of the bottom-left (once feather crowned) egg - this will be more difficult due to the unequal distribution of forces around the organic structure of an Eggshell
11. place the two Eggs, as Ovaries[^O] or Testes[^T] which share the same cytological but not etymological root which is the same in difference into the crucible also known as the air fryer and apply air and flame also known as turning the Egg timer clockwise otherwise known as deosil or sunwise or toward the Light 
12. Forget to record the rest of your ritual because you got distracted by exploring the winding etymology of all of this Oological Truth and you got hungry enough to remember that the ending has something to do with running cold water and cracking the Eggshells open to reveal the earth within with one of the Eggs disintegrating to leave only the yolk and you thought this was a lesson that maybe you should have cooked them one at a time or maybe this was meant to happen exactly like this in one out take 





Semen - seed - stillness as a crucible 
Semen - ejaculate - motion as homunculus[^H]

Egg - space - stillness as a crucible 
Egg - bird - motion as homunculus[^H]



[^H]: During medieval and early modern times, it was thought that homunculus, an artificial humanlike being, could be created through alchemy{redacted}cluding local dignitaries

[^O]:  mid-14c., egge, mostly in northern England dialect, from Old Norse egg, from Proto-Germanic ajja(m) (source also of Old Saxon, Middle Dutch, Dutch, Old High German, German ei, Gothic ada), probably from PIE *owyo-/*oyyo- "egg" (source also of Old Church Slavonic aja, Russian jajco, Breton ui, Welsh wy, Greek ōon, Latin ovum); root *awi- "bird." 
the birds themselves being witnessed
that which is capable of flight[^O]


[^T]:  Testis - "a testicle," 1704, from Latin testis forming "testicle," a word witnessed as a special application of testis "witness" (testament) on the notion of what "bears witness to virility" or motion
*a witness to flight patterns of a bird,* 
*or the flight patterns of birds themselves*[^T]
