i could hold you like a child / i could kiss you on the tongue / i could hold you til the mourning / but then all your work would be done 

i am beyond all perception / all wrapped up in lessons learned / i've paid respects and countless debtors / for the eyes that i have earned

For the lines that I have blurred 
For the  have erred 

All I am that I am not 
All the wisdom I forgot 
All I am that I am not 
All the flowers all the rot 






I am a rollercoaster 


I GOT SCARLET FEVER FROM MAKING TOO MANY VICTORIAN REFERENCES




I am a rollercoaster 
And I will make everyone sick
