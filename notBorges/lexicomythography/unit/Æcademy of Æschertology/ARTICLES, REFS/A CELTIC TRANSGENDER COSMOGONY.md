permalink: A CELTIC TRANSGENDER COSMOGONY
---
Dear My People which are Your People and My God which is Theirs. 
This part of the book, or all of it, but definitely not none of it, is for absolutely All of you from absolutely All of me. 

Transgender and Celtic (and, pretty much every minority possible to be listed but I cannot speak for them* and so will let them sing their own Songs of Tragedy which through the ages of treading paths of becoming in spite of being as the leaves gone trodden wove and warped and warbled into 'Melody') individuals share a common thread in that our history has been erased. 

In fact, I cannot speak for any Body but my own, which aches with ability within disability, my ability has always been focused around creation from destruction, or amalgamation of opposites, my tongue, cut out as I re-enacted in a concrete room of strangers but for One Called Leah who in the Bible Story mirrors Mine and in Human Form mirrors mine in Other Ways - runs over, as a river, all amalgam filling in my teeth. I have always had a penchant for the sweet, and the unspeakably bitter. 

				My ceremonial flame suggests its death, and I peer upon it.
				In my awareness, the light comes back. 
				As I write that previous full stop, the flame consumes its last breath of oxygen and I am uncontrollably moved to tears and tears and tears as sung so beautifully by one of my Living Ancestors who goes by the realest name of ANOHNI. 
Which starts with A which is an Ending and going in deeper has a circle which is a Ring and I am rocking as a rock cannot I am rocking for all the Standing Stones beneath that pond in Queens Park Pond and I am trying to catch it as I try to catch it is slips from me as the wake of the funeral Rites-gone-wrung out washcloth of a dream - 
Oh, Orpheus, Morpheus, arms muscular and hairy, fresh-injected with Testosterone 
Sweet, sweet smell of long-forgotten Sweat 
My Masculine Horned-God wears a binder, 
A chest bound to reveal the realness in the absence of the breast given in a righteous so-called wrongness. 
My Sacred Masculine, Baphomet, Or Pan, or Cernunnos, Blowing his own Trumpet-Pipe strapped on around HIS neck and groin*
has a vulva or a sacred genitalia marginalia meeting undefinable - opening, opening, opening to the feminine principle 

Within my pantheon - every God and Goddess and Gender-Transcending-Sent-By-Lunar-Illness-Makes-Illumination - requires, by birthright or by moving planets to ensure our Births assigned as liminality - their pronoun be fully capitalised 
as a SCREAM of becoming, wholeness, hole within the wholeness 

Loch Ness 
A phallic symbol - waving, in and out, mysterious, penile, penal punished by a HERstory swept out to the C for Cock for Fucking which is Feminine.

I care not, or knot, for any resistance in the rendered fists of cisgender thoughts on this. This is not a fight, or war, the war you brought to US is not MINE. 
OUR history is OURs to Right, Now. 

Whether You are listening or hearing does not matter I am writing for the sake of Record - acclimating all the cells to a Novel of a Body of Work I Shamefully Forgot within my Miss Plaiced Shame. 

We do not deserve shame. 

Shame is an inappropriate reaction, a bag of sand where the Golden Idol of Wrath and Rage should be, yielding countless billions of weapons not for an active sense of destruction or a reactive sense of protection but as proactive action of Reminding Every One
That We Are Here. 

We Deserve to Be Heard, 
Herd
Ear to Ground, Ear to Air, I sing 

By Testing Professional-Blow-Job-Giving to the People and the Men who've Taken, Taken, Taken\

	Not Quite Everything. 

I was provoked to noticing. 
Notice, Sing, 
No Tie - String. 
Ring Ring Ring around the Rose I am Becoming-
No means No. 
Means Gnosis. 
Cyst - Syrinx - Water Nymph 
Feminine that has a Dick or Divine Marriage of Hermaphoditia (SHE/HER pronouns and I won't say please to please you) where you erroneously think an Opening should be but
No, this-

Tea:
in Truth, in Virtue As In 
Sin (with a missing, but sounded G, for God in Goddess, Essen, Eating Fruit Before Eve had a chance to Hand it to The So-Called First Man who was Preceded by Saint Lilith - )
As In 
Syncretic - As In - The Best Approximation To Our Wholeness We Can Muster Because You Placed Us As Chess Pieces Upon A Board of Boring Games and By Boring I Mean As Trepan As In Drilling Holes Into Our Skull To Perform Lobotomies Gone Wrong In Favour Of Our Gods And So Our Souls Came Out As You Tried To Split Our Bodies Like A Tin Of Packed Sardines Longing To Return To The Sea And So Our Souls Of Heart And Soles Of Dancing Shoes On Feet Danced Through An Endless Doorway And Came Out, Out! Oh! The Infernal Places We Came Out Into the Opener Air!

We Are The Cutting Of Delilah's Hair. 

This last rhyme and this whole time I've not been wriitng this BODY IS NOT MINE IT BELONGS TO THEY/THEM/SHE/HER/HE/HIM/HYMN/I/SINGH/I/SIN/I/SING/ISING/FOR/THEM/I-AM/BUT/ICING/ON/THEIR/LAYERED/INFINITE/SWEET/CAKE

and I am moved by some known, known, Noetic force to meet them in my 
Dancing 
Pansy, 
I am the 'Pussy' As In Penis
I am the 'Cock' as in Chick 

I am the time that Land Forgot 

I am the Island left to Rot we are the trees we are the trees I am crying for Them and for Me 
Oh Sweet, Sweet Silver Shining Serpent Skin Shed Unprotected Unholy of Holies 

I can feel them all run through me 

Rivers, 
They lead 
They are lead-to-Gold in Aur - in Awe - in- Augury
I See them in the Birds as in Girls as In Buoys as in Every Endless Shade of Autumn in Between

You Cannot Crumple Us, no matter how good our Bodies Sound in the Breakage of the Vein 
The Vain, The Vanity - The Daffodil of Wales, of Scotland, Ireland, Cornwall, 
Cornucopia of Marching Aria-Buzzing Singing Black, Yelled, Black Ringed Bees 
We Perform Our Own Wedding Ceremonies 
Wedding as in Shedding as In Closure as an Opening as In We are Being Killed but We Will All Ways Be More Free Than Any Hateful Fist or Weal in Wheel in Reddest Deadened Welted Skin Not Clothed In Tartan But In Yards of Yards of Satin And Expensive Shows of No-Prosperity 

WE Are More Abundant in our poverty than all the empires piles of bodies belonging to US 

I type those last two letters and my be=ody \\\ becomes a serpent 
it becomews three 
I am =beneath this home i nearly burned but in the Biurning Hide I  Became Me 
I came out to Identity 
It drills in me 
It drills as metal filings caught in web-like mucus in the corners of Allergic Eyes 

A-to-E
It warps through HIM, wefted by ME

The Snake of Eden 
And Gethsemane 
My Semen, Saliva, Cum To Get Her 
Just You Fucking Wait And See 

With gentle and so righteous anger I have moved out of any definable stage of grief I have all of IT and THEM inside of me 

Holding me.

Note 
I 
 -
have to get this down as THEY the deities both plural and so-singular are singing all their choruses for US to HE/AR/e

Sing. 

I sing for ME. for US. for THEM, and in this case I use the pronoun in oh-so absolute plurality.






I'd like to, in this state of fullness-chaos-order-coming-back-to-the circular book at the centre of the library which holds all the answers but is obfuscated by the so-called entropy, build a Celtic Transgender Cosmogony which is rooted in personal memory and meaning, transcending both and becoming Mythos.

At The Beginning, Ending, and Middling inner-Pathworking of this Story (which is His/Hers/Theirstory) is a Library as depicted by Borges.

My Right knee aches - signalling a calling from the masculine; HE wishes to be heard, Herd, Cattle, Ox, Horned-God-Almighty, So-called Devil, mister Standing Under Every Thing. 

I straighten - *queer* my leg.

you are a seed 
containing a flower 

which rots and turns into a tree 

which stays and stands on stones of self-producing harmony 
through harm, through leaving 
you are coming into being 

Bee, 
go fumble, don't be humble, you're a fucking trans-end-ant-entity.

because S Should be for Safety and for Shame on Those who don't Agree. 

you are a seed unsewn by any known nomenclature 
you named your self - 
how miraculous it is that you should even still be here on this incredibly backwards and profoundly sick society. 

Don't adjust. 
Don't adjust to their TV (Transvestite) Screen
Hollow, Graphemes have the answers 
All my Trans Sisters Sibling Cygnets and my Brothers 

Oh How I Am Loving You As A Mirror Loves The Light -

It doesn't matter, what's more important is you listen to the Waves You Feel.

[ritual of becoming]

take the glass jar - a door - of silverskin onions, or any other fucking thing you want 

open it, hungrily 

eat as many as you want, shovel them in that glorious gob of yours, no thought of anything but sensation 

nourish your heavenly body 
for it has layers, upon layers, upon spinning wheels of multi-dimensional gordian knotted layers beyond the seeing of anybody on this earth but felt so deeply in the rhythm of the deities you are having a part in creating through your symbology
your symbols, your crashing waves, your spit, your piss, your mercury, sulphur and your salt, all of it is your body is your symbol is your world is ours this world is ours too and we deserve to take up space and be as big or small or spoonfuls or forking paths of onions as we want to be

pay no attention to the two slices of pickle left. 
you can take them or leave them. all of the organic magnificence turns into shit, which is divinity, anyway.

B as in Bumble Ã as in All-Ends U as in You Transformed Me into O which is a circle but there's something so important missing witch is I


This absence of my I in Sight as in fore and back to hindsight was the answer

*****Logical form**:Â In linguistics, the variant of a linguistic expression's syntactic structure that undergoes semantic interpretation*

there was no getting into you there was only pouring what I thought was me into you right until 
the end of you is LF which sounds the same as Aleph which is the beginning of every possible future we were never meant to share which is Aleph which is and Ending which is a mobius tape loop in a machine you so meaningfully bent just like you meant to with your All too careful hands by hand and hand bye hands bye hands bye hands and everything an outpouring of welcoming goodbye to everything is for Ending or for Elephant Juice which squeezing from obsidian when moving your sweet lips might look like saying I Love You but it's just a Little Fantasy of Leaving For the Lonely Fall that's Looming Finally at the Start of All which Sits in Aleph

all roads lead a Way from you 
held right in the middle of your name, I should have known what was the Sun to the World of you 

the ending of you is LF which is Aleph is the beginning of Everything starts with E is for ending
or for excrement 
and just before the letter E inside the mEssage I'll be sEnding you I will Endeavour to 

devour your sickness, 
devour your earth, 
inhale your wickedness, 
induce your birth. 
and know your worth

No, 
You're Worth.

âHey Yew, 
Wishing to Wellness of Writing me
Who is B-
Who is Barnabie
Who is knot-gone but all ways in some way with in Me- 

Thank you for the patience and understanding in my silence. I am back from hospital and almost done with my story which has taken form of a book with 144,000 words

I want to honor our shared history by giving you my consent to include my story in your zine. This feels like the right balanceâfor both of us to hold our parts of this story with care and respect. For me, this is also about creating a sense of closure and safety, especially given how close our lives remain in proximity.

It still hurts, a Hole Helluva lot, but I've learned How much H stands for Hurting and Healing and Holding and Hollowness 


With this, I wish you only kindness and love as you continue to tell your story which is part of me, and Iâll do the same with mine which is part of you. 

I hope this gesture carries the peace we both need.

Yours, knot-yours
Not Mine as in to be owned but as in oar 
witch I row, row, row 
on my own, but all-one

Calliope as in me as in poe as in Tree as in I'll 
Be- (Oak, A)
-Seeing Yew
