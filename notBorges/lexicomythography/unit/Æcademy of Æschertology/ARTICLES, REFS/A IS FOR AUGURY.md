Basil: I. Add two leaves of basil to a pot emptied of its pickles but still kept so lovingly for its deliciously deceptively useful juices II. understood to mean 'monarch', referring to either a 'king' or an 'emperor'Aries.

Aries:Aries:Bound the sign assigned to The Emperor Card in Fourth Card encapsulated in the complete yet always changing Seeker's journey of the Major Arcana of the game of tarot

Bound:As in the leadingDimensions partner of the Word 'Bound'

Dimensions:If you're reading this left to right, that is.† 

†:But if you're seeing the words you're reading more like cross sections of resonance of meaningmean 
and memory intersecting, through space of unspeakably bi- then tri-furcated fractals of dimensions of causality, with ineffably countably infinite variablesN, then you might be beginning to write these words back then

Aria: -DneDne or Do Not Enter Wheels Whose Writing hear or Dominant Negative Effect, which, necessarily,  counters the expected mechanism of gene-to-product relationships.

that: "I Am" - That Eye  Am
Am:The Only one. Or, The radioactive synthetic metal bearing the symbol 'Am' is commonly used in smoke alarms, and may never be used in spacecraft batteries in the future because it already has-been

mag: as in the bulgarian sound to describe 'store' or 'shop in redacted {near plovdiv}div where we bought a bottle of beer each and sat on the curb and became a family' such as in a fanzine (n.) 1949, from fan (n.2) + suf(fix) (a)bs(t)ra(c)ted from ma(g)azine. 1969 in reference to car wheels, "made of magnesium alloy."

Tarot: The Moon (XVIII) is the eighteenth trumpAria or Major ArcanaDne card(in) all I see in most traditional tarot decks, the Fifteenth n.b. that set of roman numerals that when you turn you neck sideways if you can or maybe the screen you're reading this on looks like some kind of bird creasing and laughing at you in profile facing the opposite direction in a different dimension to balance out the waveform.
div:less than 'div' is greater than itself which is itself greater than nothing without less than greater than foreword before going back into 'div' which can mean a few things i.e. 'you right div, I still, love you' which is itself in the backward book-ending with babbling brooksjudas of unhooked screws of mind scrambled rambles of roses and brambles of whom are infinitely greater than nothing read hues, just there, tightly gaining size to learn yearning's what they wilt into-
judas:What if that’s the Beast of Revelation that the number 666 refers to. The three each with their own dualities with a further third factor of exponent make 666 organisational blocks or units of meaning running through the bible, with each word carrying its own infinite library of meanings through resonance , and the number of the Beast means this book will become the Chains of the devil card that require the entirety of most of the god-fearing world in order for enough people to realise they needn’t go to lift them -Judas 13:27quickly
quickly: Now, what, what are You, going? 
toSayForYourself:The term "camel case" comes from the capital letters' resemblance to a camel's humps. It's commonly used in experimental programming, invalid web URLs, and one-sided text messaging.
