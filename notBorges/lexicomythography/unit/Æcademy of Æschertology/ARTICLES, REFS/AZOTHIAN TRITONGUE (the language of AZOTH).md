I: The Isness 
II: The Contrast 
III: The Witness

<b><u>the photosynthetic cosmogyny, [the Sowing oath cycle]:</u></b>
—No *Thing* at All Births this Isness as ‘*Now’*;  [the one; the absolute indivisable source, the pleroma, ein sof]
As Visible Isness Sires Contrasting Sow;  [the two; duality, contrast, differentiation, yin / yang]
And contrast in turn nurses Witness of how— [the three; the trinity; the concept of perception is born from the concept of duality or differentiation]

<extension: severance, reaping, harvesting, scything of the cycle, uttered only once as an ‘amen’:>
The burned and fuelled [fire]
The drowned and drunk [water]
The bellowing, breathless Branch [air]
Bears the Fruit, from the Root, [earth, the ten thousand things]
the inevitable trunk





A Being bellowing (the word for communicating via sounds made with the body) the semantic vertex (spoken words) of the Azothian Triad is known as a Dagger (of the Azothian Orison), 
- Azothian Spells, or ‘Oaths’, are spiritual vehicles of awareness intended to transport the Self with compassionate providence towards evermore present awareness; each cell of each pmade up of vibrations from the Azothian Orison.


- Latin transliteration (representation of Azothian Tablet using the latin alphabet) is known as Azoleneumzt (etymologically rooted in the Story of Selene’ and ending with the salinzt suffix to reference the drawing down of ethereal conceptual divine clouds of ideas into concrete written symbols). it is stylised in ALL CAPS FORMAT to insufficiently but necessarily convey its amorphous cacophony. Azoleneumzt acts as the ferryman for the journey across the river of Resonance between the Azothian states of Melody and Harmony; and the toll, the coin that must be present on the tongue at all times, is the inevitable dilution of essence, cropping of intended meaning, deleterious condensation for the sake of accessibility. 

A Being etching (the word for communicating via symbolic alphabet) the symbolic vertex (written symbolic alphabet) of the Azothian Triad is known as a Chisel (of the Azothian Tablet)

- this vertex is just as difficult to master as it seems; the difficulty lying in the intricacy of drawing the symbols themselves and the volume of visual memorisation required, but momentum in learning trajectory provided by the strongly typed phonetic system of symbology (symbols sounds do not change once ‘sealed’ / etched)
A Being signing (the word for communicating via movement of the body) the somatic vertex (nonverbal communication) of the Azothian Triad is known as an Anvil (of the Azothian Rites) 
- The Rites are a combination of hand signs, facial expressions, bodily postures, ceremonial, for a large part intuited/channeled movement of the body 
- this vertex appears on first consideration to be the easiest to adopt, but is the most difficult to master. 
A Being may be One, Two, All or None of these according to Their Will. 
Dagger
Chisel
Anvil 


Proficiency and ineffable understanding of a single vertex of Azothian Tritongue is termed ‘Melody’: e.g. [the] CHISEL (person adept in writing Azothian Tablet aka symbols) [was/is] MELODIC [in writing] AZOTHIAN TABLET 
Proficiency in multiple aspects of Azothian Tongue is known as Harmony: e.g. [the] BEING [was/is] HARMONIC [in writing and speaking] AZOTHIAN TABLET [and] ORISON
Complete mastery and ineffable understanding of Azothian Tritongue’s totality is called Silence. I [my] AZOTHIAN TRITONGUE [knows the truest meaning is only held in] SILENCE <you see here an example of how the lanugage itself is semantically treated as a sentient Being in itself Azothian tritongue ‘knows’; and the Dagger referring to the language in possessive form (my)>



<b><u>AZOTH</u></b> pronunciation:
A- Air - outward Ah - the innate, divine Sigh.
Z - Fire - outward (terminal stop) Z - a buzzing spark of darting, uncontainable potentiality, requires attentive awareness to execute. 
O - Water - inward o- as in ‘Loss’ - a reflexive, receptive thirst of cool, restorative roundness.
Th - Earth - inward (terminal stop) ‘th’ as in ‘Thy’ - whispering caress at end of inhale, barely heard, but felt by the tongue.

<b><u>AZOTHIAN</u></b> pronunciation: 
Ah-Z-**OATH**-ee-un [to denote and symbolise how the very act of naming something, in this case the language itself, turns said thing into a covenant with a Story, which is insufficient but necessary for the futile yet nurturing attempt to infer meaning from The Unexplainable].

The semantic field for the nomenclature of Azothian draws from botanical, alchemical and musical sources. The linguistic structure of Azothian maps rigidly and entirely to the magick system itself, as it is inextricably intwined with, and a part of it. 


CAMBIUXH, or — The One [insert Azothian translation for the number one here]: The combined essence, conscious and subconscious intent, rhetoric and energetic valency that underlie all is termed the **cambiuxh (**pronounced cam-bee-yoo-xh [xh = soft ‘juh’ like j’taime or the ‘ge’ from fromage]**.**
PHLOEM, or — The Two[insert Azothian translation for the number two here]: The contrast and subsequent distinctive boundaries introduced by individual ‘cells’ (words)/sonic units, called **‘phloem’**
Every single cell corresponds to at least a single word, but oftentimes a vague general concept or ineffable felt sense, which is then whittled down to specifics by the contextual parameters of the grammar system and the 
XYLEM, or - The Three[insert Azothian translation for the number three here]: A single ‘gist’ or sentiment of a person’s expression (which might be called a ‘paragraph’ in literary science or a ‘point’ in spoken conversation) is known as a ’TRACHEID’.
Phrases 

GRAMMAR:
No ‘gender’ of grammar but instead ‘Polarity’ - the SULFURZAH (sulfuric words, the nouns for which end with -Zah suffix), the SALINZT (saline words, the nouns for which end with -Zt suffix), the MERCURIAXH (mercurial words , the nouns for which end with the -xh suffix; pronounced like the soft ‘j’ in j'taime) 


This system of trinity is essential and nested in a fractalesque manner throughout Azothian grammar. 

ZT SALINZT (THE SALINE; the yin polarity; body; the omega; Felt Sense and Manifestation of Form; demonic but not to be misunderstood as ‘evil’ as this is an erroneous concept that doesn’t exist within AZOTH or the Azothian Tongue - there is no word for evil. This p) 

ZAH SULFURZAH (THE SULFURIC; the yang polarity; soul; the alpha; Conscious Awareness; )

XH MERCURIAXH (THE MERCURIAL; the liminal; spirit; the ineffable; Divine Intelligence)

- **EH (🜁 - Air)**: Expansiveness and intellectual clarity.
