The Spiritual Media Platform. 


<b><u>HERALD</u></b> is a contemplative platform for alchemical transmutation of the Self, based upon the **Alchemical Zymurgy of Tarot Heuristics [AZOTH] magick system.** 
User inputs are collected via a ‘CRUCIBLE’ (entry form UI) which may pop up at regular intervals (through toggelable notifications) or at the user’s discretion.
HERALD allows user to record free text journal entries, their mood (valency vs intensity), track their behaviours (transmuting bad habits into positive habits), and tarot readings , interpreted using my alchemical tree of elemental magic system 
The crucible is customisable with the fields the user wishes to use (at least one must be toggled ‘on’)

All data contributes to the user’s ‘Resonance’, a musical synthesis of the user’s overall state across time, procedurally generated by SuperCollider yang data and manipulated/processed using the algorithmic logic implemented according to yin data.

| **UNIT NAME** | **TIME PERIOD** |
| -- | -- |
| MEASURE | SINGLE ENTRY |
| PHRASE | DAY |
| LINE | WEEK |
| CYCLE | MONTH |
| MOVEMENT | QUARTER |
| SYMPHONY | YEAR |


**Fig. 1: Resonance units**
*A single user entry produces a ‘measure’ of SuperCollider procedurally generated music*
*A daily period of user entries produces a ‘phrase’ of SuperCollider procedurally generated music*
*A weekly period of user entries produces a ‘line’ of SuperCollider procedurally generated music*
*A monthly period of user entries produces a ‘cycle’ of SuperCollider procedurally generated music*
*A quarterly period of user entires produces a ‘movement’ of SuperCollider procedurally generated music*
*A yearly period of user entries produces a ‘symphony’ of SuperCollider procedurally generated music.*



<u>STAVE VIEW:</u>
Placed centrally in the UI
Built in C with Unity, this ‘game’ feature is as simple as Chrome’s in built dinosaur playable sidescroller when the 404 error shows up 
But with the feeling of ‘Journey’ by Thatgamecompany
Waveform is a static image like an audacity trace 
User presses a key/button and the waveform zooms in to become terrain 
Sound begins and user can traverse stave like a sidescroller 
Staves available to traverse as phrases, lines, cycles, movements, or symphonies (provided sufficient data) 

<u>COLLECTIVE RESONANCE:</u>
Clicking the Globe icon allows the user to enter Stave View for Collective Resonance - the global consciousness state for any given unit of resonance, and shows the user their individual waveform alongside it, to give a sense of connection to the whole world’s journey through their memories, emotions, addictions, self-improvement. 

*Need to do a lot of conceptualisation work on how the Yang data will actually be utilised / show up in the stave view, for both individual user and collective stave view* 




|  | **YIN** | **YANG** | **NOTES** |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| COLLECTION MODALITY | Regular time intervals | At each user entry | How to ensure scalability & eliminate risk of high server costs for regular data collection? |
| SALT DATA | Tasklist state (number of tasks, completed vs not completed, task list tag & subtag distribution, each tag & subtag with their own effects on sound manipulation params) | Each parameter makes specific sound using SuperCollider -rough example: Tag - drone note/octave; subtag - treble note or instrument;  effort - amplitude; priority - filter frequency | This data contributes to previously named ‘CCPHNY’ functionality (sound profile generated by user’s ‘busyness’ / the chaos of their task list  ) - viewable separately on ‘PRIMA’ tab |
| MERCURY DATA | Number of total entries | Journal TextEntry measurements (length, sentiment from NLP) | This data contributes to previously named ‘SYMPHNY’ functionality (musical snapshots generated through sentiment analysis & SuperCollider); mercury is spirit, higher divine self |
| SULPHUR DATA | Habit state (equation for days successful / number of habits tracked) | Tracked medication taken ✔️ cravings beaten ✔️ positive habit/exercise done ✔️ | Sulphur functionality is a transmutation of addictions/bad habits into positive life changes e.g. substitution of smoking for exercise - user can set config of app to define ‘base metals’ (negative traits) to turn into ‘gold’ (positive traits) Sulphur is subconscious; habitual animalistic self |
| ALEMBIC DATA | Current moon phase | Mood vs moonPhase | newMood has its own visualisation page/view on the application which shows visually stunning depiction of user’s mood correlation with moon phase over time. |
| ATHANOR DATA | Spread history (minor/major arcana ratio, when each cardinal direction’s corresponding element (north for air, south for earth, west for water, east for fire) maps to the tarot suit (wands = fire, cups = water, swords = air, pentacles = earth) the parameters make for more concordant overall sound, when they divert the params make for more discordance | each card has its own pre-made instrument component, meaning five instruments per cardinal ‘measure’ | Cardinal’ (tarot spread) functionality - four cardinal directions & centre card , functional logic to combine elements using Alchemical Tree of Elemental Tarot magic system |

| **MODULE** | **DATA** | **INPUT TYPE** | **YIN CONTRIBUTION TO STAVE** | **YANG CONTRIBUTION TO STAVE** |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| SALT | TODO | OBJ (fields = task, tag, subtag, effort, priority) | Tasklist state (number of tasks, completed vs not completed, task list tag & subtag distribution, each tag & subtag with their own effects on sound manipulation params) | Each parameter makes specific sound using Tone.js -rough example: Tag - drone note/octave; subtag - treble note or instrument;  effort - amplitude; priority - filter frequency |
| SULPHUR | HABITS | OBJ of BOOLEANs (done today for + habits = success, not done today for - habits = success) so fields = albedo (positive habit): bool, nigredo (negative habit/addiction): bool | Habit state (equation for days successful / number of habits tracked) impacts note randomness | Tracked medication taken ✔️ cravings beaten ✔️ positive habit/exercise done ✔️ |
| MERCURY | JOURNAL | STRING | Number of total entries affects complexity ? Randomness? | Journal TextEntry measurements (length, sentiment from NLP) |
| ALEMBIC | MOOD | MULTI-DIM ARRAY [valency vs intensity] | Current moon phase affects global amplitude (so that a monthly ‘cycle’ has a fade in/fade out, with the full moon being peak amplitude and new moon being nearly silent; leading to 12 ‘pulses’/crossfades over a yearly ‘symphony’ | Three instruments - one for current mood (parameters of key signature & octave determined by intensity & valency values ), one for current moon phase (pre-defined parameters for each phase of the moon) and one for Correlation between current mood and moonPhase (predefined parameters for range of normalised values produced by equation) |
| ATHANOR | TAROT | OBJ (fields = north, south, east, west, centre) | Spread history (minor/major arcana ratio, when each cardinal direction’s corresponding element (north for air, south for earth, west for water, east for fire) maps to the tarot suit (wands = fire, cups = water, swords = air, pentacles = earth) the parameters make for more concordant overall sound, when they divert the params make for more discordance | each card has its own pre-made instrument component, meaning five instruments per athanor ‘measure’ |

<u>Data protection</u>
Auth for user accounts 
All actual words entered in the journal (mercury) are protected and private to the user only, but the musical result of sentiment analysis on the collective Resonance is public 
All actual habits (sulphur) are protected and private to the user, but the musical effect of user’s ‘success’ on the collective Resonance is public
All actual words entered into the todos/tasks are protected and private to the user, but the resultant musical effect of task list state, tag/subtag distribution, effort & priority distribution on the collective Resonance is public
All tarot card pull (athanor) data is public but not mapped to individual users , whereas interpretations according to magic system and personalised to the individual user are private 
When I say ‘public’ for all of the above, I mean observable as effects on the waveform in stave view & the musical aesthetic, any popups/interactive elements are anonymous and NOT mapped to individual user contribution to protect user’s privacy.

HERALD is the prismatic seed project of CR.ux, designed as a vehicle to interface with the ineffable. It guides users on a pilgrimage of alchemical self-transformation with the following core concepts:

 Core Concepts:
- Musical Framework: At its heart, HERALD features a captivating musical framework that helps users regularly connect with their inner awareness. This interactive tool reflects how our surroundings (above) mirror our internal state (below), and it connects to the collective resonance of all users and the Moon.
- Emotional Distillation: HERALD distills emotional states, menial tasks, and habit transmutation statistics into a personal ‘Resonance’. This downloadable audio, procedurally generated by the Herald Orchestral Leviathan Interpretive Engine (HOLIE), is transformed into an interactive 2D sidescroller. HOLIE is an intricately composed tapestry of algorithms, with inputs categorized into Yin and Yang data. All data is transparently visible within the app and expanded upon [here]() for those interested in exploring further.
- Stave View: Traverse the sound of your memories as a stunning 2D sidescroller, from daily ‘Phrases’ to Monthly ‘Cycles’, Quarterly ‘Movements’, and Annual ‘Symphonies’. These procedurally generated music pieces are based on your personal state of being throughout each period, with entities and transformations encountered based on your data at that particular Measure of the Resonance.

 Key Features:
1. CRUCIBLE (Entry Form UI):
   - An elegant home for your journaling, mood tracking, habit tracking, and tarot readings.
   - Collect data at regular intervals or at user discretion, providing a holistic view of personal growth.

2. Resonance:
   - Musical synthesis of user data, creating a unique auditory representation of personal and collective states.
   - Data units (Measure, Phrase, Line, Cycle, Movement, Symphony) represent varying time periods, from single entries to yearly summaries.

3. Stave View:
   - Interactive, game-like feature where users traverse their personal data represented as musical waveforms.
   - Explore different staves based on data accumulation (phrases, lines, cycles, movements, symphonies).

4. Motivation Strategies:
   - Task Completion (SALT): Encourages task completion by generating more chaotic and fuller Resonances when tasks are neglected.
   - Habit Goals (SULPHUR): Promotes adherence to habit goals by creating joyful melodic Resonances for each day of sobriety or habit achievement, with a dull drone for slip-ups to remind and encourage resilience.
   - Journal Entries (MERCURY): Motivates journaling by introducing rests (silence) into the Resonance and Stave View for each skipped journal entry day.

5. Integration with Mystical Practices:
   - Utilizes the Alchemical Tree of Elemental Tarot Magic system for interpreting tarot readings and other spiritual data.
   - Tracks correlations between mood, moon phases, habits, and tasks to provide deeper insights into personal and collective patterns.

 Alchemical Self-Transformation:
HERALD is rooted in the AZOTH (Alchemical Zephyr of Tarot Heuristics) magick system, providing a contemplative space for users to transmute everyday experiences, tasks, emotions, and thoughts into profound spiritual insights. By viewing the Collective Resonance, users can observe the harmony between their inner and outer worlds, fostering a sense of connection and community.
