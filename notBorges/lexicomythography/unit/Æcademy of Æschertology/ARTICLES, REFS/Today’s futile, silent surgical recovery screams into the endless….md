Today’s futile, silent surgical recovery screams into the endless void:
- I am learning to be Love in every clutching of my teddy bear and while reconnecting with my childhood self may mean even more self-pity infused tears and gripping loneliness I somehow feel safe watching the cartoons through which I used to live vicariously 
- My healing is not just about the mechanism of my jaw opening once more but also in the opening of the mechanism of my heart to accept my own company and let go of the need to be shown my own worthiness by an external source 
- While being gendered correctly may bring me safety moving through this world it is only a surface level fraction of the joy embodied by my own dedication to the painful sacrifice I am willing to take to show up for myself and only myself 
- Those who try to eschew the notion of fairness are always those privileged enough to benefit directly from the imbalanced weighing scale of privilege that perpetuates injustice 
- Stop telling trans people that you think their face is/was fine without surgery as if your opinion is important enough to have anything to do with their transition
