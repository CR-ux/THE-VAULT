permalink: MION† ENDIVE* - THE CISHET MALE

Regarding the author's note where it says they have one unifying characteristic, *they are all transgender*, and they're actually being a, and this is something that I can speak to without any fear of appropriation, any fear of being ignorant or offensive, because I was socialized male, was assigned male at birth, and it's a voice within me that I have both resisted and rejected and not been able to integrate, but this could be the perfect way in which to have a cishet male character, as in me in an alternate universe who never transitioned, expressing, having a part in the collective, but most of the members, most of these liberal members, be ousting him and making him not feel like part of it, but him not even being able to speak up and being silenced in the way that the very trans individuals are themselves, showing this kind of retaliation, an eye-for-an-eye kind of mentality that is inherently flawed and just perpetuate cycle.

***Faithful love**: Chicory is associated with waiting in vain and faithful love. In Greek mythology, chicory represents Clytia, the nymph who loved Apollo, the sun god, and died when her love was unreturned.


†The surname Myon was first found in Midlothian, where it is quite understandable that the **native Gaelic had difficulty** with this Norman surname, and it can be found in various forms, among them: Mengues, Mingies and Meyners. - this is an expression of the 'cultural appropriation' and 'Tower of Babel' concepts of the project.
