permalink: SELENA AND MYON

Setting their collaborative work during the pandemic, with Selena isolated in the Hebridean islands and Mayon working from home, creates a beautifully layered scenario. The detachment of email correspondence, while they’re in a relationship, could emphasize both the forced distance and the introspective nature of the pandemic era, where even the most intimate connections were mediated by screens. This separation would lend a bittersweet quality to their exchanges, highlighting the tension between closeness and isolation.
Their differing reactions to the pandemic—Selena’s search for ancestral meaning amidst physical isolation, and Mayon’s complex feelings about the career implications of the pandemic—could play out subtly in their messages. They could share snippets of the paper, debate ideas, and reflect on their individual experiences, with each email or message representing fragments of their broader, shared exploration. These emails could also include moments of vulnerability, where their professional focus on the paper slips into personal reflection, creating a contrast between the detached medium of email and the intensity of their shared insights.
Do you envision their communication evolving as they delve deeper into their collaborative work, perhaps moving from formal exchanges to more raw, vulnerable messages as they navigate the isolation and uncertainty of the pandemic?
