And So They Dreamed
(They Were Still A Woman 
Who Was Once Genderless But Of Masculine Form 
Who Was Now At Once Formless and Of Man):



[[the whole book]]

If every chapter of this knot non-fictional work feels like the last that's because it is not. 
It will never end 



*The acorn carries an oak tree*  
*Sleeping but for a little while*  
*Winter lies in the arms of spring*  
*As a mother carries her child*  
*And never knows*  
*How wild the wind blows*  
*A thought carries a universe*  
*A seed carries a field of grain*  
*Love lies in the arms of change*  
*As a joy carries a pain*  
*And no one knows*  
*How wild the wind blows*
