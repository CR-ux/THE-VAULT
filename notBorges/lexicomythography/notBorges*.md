<sup> not</sup>Borges is not an answer 



<sup> not</sup>Borges is the synthesis of all this turmoil and ugliness, 

with all this maniacal and depraved hypergraphic and art-compulsive nonsense

and a stillness i seem to have found

in the complete batshit insanity of this project;

with all its intersecting layers, forms and mediums, 

now, finally condensed (but, like genetic material, not decreased in size; but dissolved into fractions and rebound, as triple[^gene])



<sup> not</sup>Borges is primarily a literary project (through the lens of a sort of transmedia neophilology)-

comprised of very almost nearly One Million Words now, 

buried in nested layers of cryptic fragments somewhere online. 



this musical work, METABASIS: aRapturingGossamer.wav, forms the codex, or centrefold, or spine,

of the 22 chapters of the journal known as *Read, Wryng, Parallel.* 

which is encrypted within the metadata[^story] of the infamous work of transfeminist literature: The Woman in the Wallpaper (author REDACTED); 

The book[^story] was pulled from shelves in 2019; due to its plot being revealed as a prophecy, for exactly 23 disastrous world events, which were to immediately follow, in the order the chapters were written. 



structurally, the album is arranged as two palindromes, joined in a möbius strip.













<sup> not</sup>Borges is a question,

and the question is "are you sitting comfortably?"

which is inevitably followed (either aloud or imagined), with:
