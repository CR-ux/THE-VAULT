say, what do you mean?

say what?
Do you mean "say what you mean"?

I've been meaning to say what we have meant to me.
I meant to say: I had this horrific dream where I was eating at the top of this restaurant that was as tall as the Tower of Babel but even more likely to be toppled by God; 

I mean to say how mean you were to me. Not in the dream, at least, that one, but this one, but, I {do}n't know-- I need you to help me, isn't that what you are for? What we owe to each other?
Isn't that what we, or I, or Eye, deserve?
Deserving isn't what I mean to say, I'm far beyond any meaningful words we could have said, to try {to | and} make meaning from all our tangled, warbled, memory intersections-
I'm mean to say:
That it's quite possible, really, that I mean to say it, at least, in the least mean and realest way possible; quiet, that it is - 

I am. I am meaning. 

That's what I say. 
And whether I remember it or not, I will, all ways, be Meaning. 
Something.  

Remembering your hair in the morning, or what you made me, helped me to remember, the smell so real, I reached out and touched its softness, it gave way, like the blank space of what I used to call my own memory.
'Remembering', or rather, Re-Membering, you, rubbing your fingers, or what you designed as such, in concentric birds nest circles {to drop small offerings of sesame seeds | rock salt on the plate you topped with food for me about to make me very happily in pain| with lube or your spit between them about to make me very happily} I have been so very much {in pain} before you topped {the{m|e}}


Quite a Lot, actually, 
or maybe {t}his {as}sa{u}lt{ed} pill{a}(r|ged) {dissolving knot | not tiny | not even | bite-sized | left, without {an} Other} wife 

And finally, I am. 
the Sky
Finally, I, Filth, Source. Meaning.
the words. 
which clothe
What I Say. 

And I am, most meaningfully, 
Saying what I mean - as in, 
I am speaking my Worth, in all its confusing, verbose languages 
of endlessness | {endless|empti}|nesses}

an emptiness of characters to forgive  


for giving 
for giving is a fallacy 
for giving everything was never enough 
for giving me the ending i foresaw, forewarned, foreshadowed ![[KELPIE n. (in Celtic folklore) a water spirit capable of transfigurationâ€¦]]

for giving has taken every thing
{in},
a way 
{out}
