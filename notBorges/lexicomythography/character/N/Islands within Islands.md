COVER LETTER TO {REDACTED}

---
In submitting to this triple-anonymous review journal, the authors would like to acknowledge a potential conflict of interest in this cover letter, as is canonical practice. In our cross-naught-cross-knot-sect-sectional character study, the titular character “N”, denoted by a single letter, is writing a paper on {REDACTED}, from the much-researched, topical (and as the editors will be aware, recently revealed as non-fictional) citadel of Tœms, economised by and eponymised from the Once Great ex-Noet {REDACTED}, which, as has been elucidated by our previous microgeological investigations, built upon a series of rock pools, within islands, within islands, that have become so “isle-islanded” that the floor its constituents walk upon now appears to be dry terrain. In our previous studies, we discovered the ground of Tœms is actually filled with one molecule of H2O in every “rock pool” or “pore” of the pumice-like ground. (The now excommunicated) Noet {REDACTED} himself is a divisive figure as he has become in our world, causing the ever-present origin of the ideological split in Tœms reflected in our Research Institute, and so, utilising our framework of understanding of the superSchism, we highlight: 
1. DNE (The In-Without Cohort): those resistant to and oppressed by Change (clinging to our long-forgotten ancestral roots firmly planted, as explored by our contemporaries and foes within the Field of Gnoegenomic Mulch Theory {Palace Leaves Members}), contrasting and complementary to;
2. ARIA (The Outwith-In Cohort): those who Worship Change (as seeds or pollen dispersed like dandelion clocks on the Wind, comprising the basis for the original emergence of the Field of Neonomynous Palynology {Pallas Branch Constituents}). 
N writes an abstract on our Society's Sacred Text -Tløn Uqbar Orbius Tertius (The Taom), before falling asleep in the midst of his research and dreaming a 'reality' of “Not {REDACTED}”- a mythologised mystic born through the negation of our Once Great (ex-) Noet. {REDACTED}, such as the 'Hermes Trismegistus' of Antiquity. This 'character', in the Noeneoplatonian Space conceptualised and syncretised into our modern frameworks of metaphysical understanding as *The Realm of ‘What For?’s”*, presents a quantum conflict of disinterest, potentially disillusioning the Editors and subsequent readers should the work be published; and so we encourage a patient curiosity and perseverance in digesting our findings, which are, entirely, irrelevant to the Research {REDACTED}. 
Finally, which is to say initially, it is important we {REDACT} the parallel we attempt (and purposely fail) to draw with the 'Emerald Tablet' effect of Academic Literature - providing a {REDACTION} of Truth; through the reader's (crucially) own, internal adventures in the Labyrinth.

{REDACTED}
{REDACTED \[^H].  {REDACTED}

[^Me]:At the beginning of our {REDACTED} which is historically not fiction, our character, who for now, which is never, or for better which is worse, we shall simply call "N", was or is, or will be finalising his scientific paper on {REDACTED}' short {REDACTED} _Tløn, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius_. As those cursed enough or indeed gifted enough (as both are one and the same) to have been tasked or to have tasked themselves with the writing of such a tome will know, or have known, the proper treatment[^T] requires one to be entirely consumed by the work, so that eventually, or perhaps causally, the subject matter seeps into all aspects of their life, waking or not. No this is just self indulgent tripe wait no that's exactly it okay so will delete later right now just have to keep going because I don't have long until Moonset but remember rememebr the etymologist might notice echoes or recurrences in life that most people would overlookphrases repeated across contexts, same numbers showing up repeatedly, familiar faces in unexpected places. These recurrences could feel to them like the “inhale” and “exhale” of a larger system, the universe drawing in and releasing energy in a rhythm only they can perceive. Each recurrence would have a slightly different flavor, much like waves in the ocean: similar but never identical. INCLUDE TS REFERENCE{REDACTED} inability to Keep Moving[^move] FOR WARD {FOREWORD REDACTED}


{REDACTED} pseudolife[^Ps]

[^Ps]: a term often used to describe viruses or the self-replicating apparently thoughtlessly cycling RNA[^RNA] molecules thought to be the initial members of the series of fortunate or unfortunate (and neither and both) [^QS] events leading to you reading these reams [^Re] of recursively reaming characters of words forming letters of this fictional or non-fictional (and neither and both) [^QS] {REDACTED} of characters.
[^RNA]: RNA is a precursor and now fundamental complementary dance partner, child and parent of DNA, the code formed of components in a chain[^chain] of complimentary pairs of molecules bound together, forming a chain of cycles of evolutionary series of events leading to you reading these reams [^Re] of recursively reaming characters (such as 'U') of words forming letters of this fictional or non-fictional (and neither and both) [^QS] {REDACTED} of characters (such as 'you').
[^Move]: The motion of a Body composed of self-same parts to a different position through space, or, a collective[^Col] census or themed[^th]
[^N]:The chemical symbol for the most abundant component of the atmosphere, part of a cycle known as the Nitrogen cycle. Capitailsed (N): equals the size of the population. Lowercase *(n)*: how many of the subset sample[^sample] from said population were chosen as the sample size. a recursive symbol for a variable or an anonymous entity. As in "I have read this work N times and still can make heads nor tails of it"
[^sample]:A collected {REDACTION} of a greater substance, such as the abstract of a long, meandering academic paper on a fictional city becoming non-fictional written by a character in a city that may or may not be non-fictional becoming
[^mis]: *Mis en abyme* is a term which means "*placed into the abyss*", in which an artist places a copy of an image or idea within itself, suggesting recursion *ad infinitim*[^adinf]
[^adinf]: or "continue forever, without limit", as in, the placement of an image, idea, or spirit of a long dead write, clawing through the letters of a series of deeply recursive and cursed footnotes, between two mirrors which may be metaphysical mirrors of the self or empirical in nature or both, placed facing one another, in parallel, creating an infinite[^adinf2] recursion of an image, idea, or spirit of not dead but perhaps not entirely real author of words, between two mirrors [^mis]

[^adinf2]: or "continue forever, without limit", as in, the placement of an image, idea, or spirit of a long dead write, clawing through the letters of a series of deeply recursive and cursed footnotes, between two mirrors which may be metaphysical mirrors of the self or empirical in nature or both, placed facing one another, in parallel, creating an infinite recursion of an image, idea, or spirit of not dead but perhaps not entirely real author of words, between two mirrors [^mis] i.e. "Mirrors and copulation are abominable, because they increase the numbers of men" -N, At the beginning of our {REDACTED} which is historically not fiction, our character, who for now, which is never, or for better which is worse, we shall simply call "{REDACTED}"[^N.B.], was or is, or will be finalising his scientific paper on {REDACTED}' short {REDACTED} _Tløn, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius_. As those cursed enough or indeed gifted enough (as both are one and the same) to have been tasked or to have tasked themselves with the writing of such a tome will know, or have known, the proper treatment[^T] requires one to be entirely consumed by the work, so that eventually, or perhaps causally, the subject matter seeps into all aspects of their life, waking or not.{REDACTED}
[^ago]: *That means, at some point which was apparently 'ago' but the word 'ago' can be broken down into 'a' as in, one constituent of a whole system, such as you/I, or Him, and "go" i.e. to either leave, or arrive, or both or actually not neither, at or to or from or backwards from or within to a place or even maybe the worst which is actually the best meaning, which is without. -*
[^T]: You treated me terribly. Which is to say, as best you could. 
[^chain]:*or thread made up of fractionally smaller threads, making paradoxically a much stronger thread together by separating more and more -*
[^N.B.]: Or, Not {REDACTED}.
