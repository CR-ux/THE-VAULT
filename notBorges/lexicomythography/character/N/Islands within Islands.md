COVER LETTER TO THE EDITOR(S)

---
In submitting to this triple-anonymous review journal, the authors would like to acknowledge a potential conflict of interest in this cover letter, as is canonical practice. In our cross-naught-cross-knot-sect-sectional character study, the titular character “N”, denoted by a single letter, is writing a paper on Borges, from the much-researched, topical (and as the editors will be aware, recently revealed as non-fictional) citadel of Tœms, economised by and eponymised from the Once Great ex-Noet Borges, which, as has been elucidated by our previous microgeological investigations, built upon a series of rock pools, within islands, within islands, that have become so “isle-islanded” that the floor its constituents walk upon now appears to be dry terrain. In our previous studies, we discovered the ground of Tœms is actually filled with one molecule of H2O in every “rock pool” or “pore” of the pumice-like ground. (The now excommunicated) Noet Borges himself is a divisive figure as he has become in our world, causing the ever-present origin of the ideological split in Tœms reflected in our Research Institute, and so, utilising our framework of understanding of the superSchism, we highlight: 
1. DNE (The In-Without Cohort): those resistant to and oppressed by Change (clinging to our long-forgotten ancestral roots firmly planted, as explored by our contemporaries and foes within the Field of Gnoegenomic Mulch Theory {Palace Leaves Members}), contrasting and complementary to;
2. ARIA (The Outwith-In Cohort): those who Worship Change (as seeds or pollen dispersed like dandelion clocks on the Wind, comprising the basis for the original emergence of the Field of Neonomynous Palynology {Pallas Branch Constituents}). 
N writes an abstract on our Society's Sacred Text -Tløn Uqbar Orbius Tertius (The Taom), before falling asleep in the midst of his research and dreaming a 'reality' of “Not Borges”- a mythologised mystic born through the negation of our Once Great (ex-) Noet. Borges, such as the 'Hermes Trismegistus' of Antiquity. This 'character', in the Noeneoplatonian Space conceptualised and syncretised into our modern frameworks of metaphysical understanding as *The Realm of ‘What For?’s”*, presents a quantum conflict of disinterest, potentially disillusioning the Editors and subsequent readers should the work be published; and so we encourage a patient curiosity and perseverance in digesting our findings, which are, entirely, irrelevant to the Research Story. 
Finally, which is to say initially, it is important we acknowledge the parallel we attempt (and purposely fail) to draw with the 'Emerald Tablet' effect of Academic Literature - providing a 'moat' of pseudo-intellectuality through inaccessible language, in order to both obfuscate and encourage discovery of Truth; through the reader's (crucially) own, internal adventures in the Labyrinth.

METANALYSIS
---
---

*"Mirrors and copulation are abominable, because they in-crease the numbers of men. Yea, in the words of Carla Jung:
	“We had forgotten that Borges is terrible...Satan taught; God is love. But you should know that love is also terrible.”"*
<p style="text-align:right;">-Noet Borges</p>

FABRICATION OF FINDINGS
---

As he entered his dream, so often fraught with nightmarish incoherence, he was always about to remember something verbatim for the last time in his life, that either his worst friend or his favourite rapist told him:
	“Arguments, like waves, fractal out—each one spiralling, branching, not towards an end but infinitely outward, telling ‘owt’ in every turn, like the rings of a tree or the curves of a shell. Each moment of anger, laughter, silence, branches off into another, repeating yet never the same, mirroring itself in form, but never in content. What looks like chaos is only a zoomed-in fragment of the whole—self-similar, recursive, a breath within a breath.”


WITHHELD DISCUSSION
---

'The thing is.' He thought. Or I did:
	When you are captivated by writing, or art, or any of the nine Muses that take inifinitely and absolutely no names whatsoever only letters, as in, the kind you post[^ago] -
	You take your place in the absolutely free-will powered and therefore counter- and therefore intuitively chain[^ch][^chain] Of people, beings that breathe the way I/you do or He does, and indeed beings that breathe in ways you and/or I or rather He which means All of us know or can never truly know which means we always did know they could -


CONCLUSION
---

N wanted to shake Borges back to life somehow and say, with words:

I tried.

[^Ch]:The word 'chain' means both a sequence of events, but also a symbol for binding, restriction. Binding itself being the trauma that is the fuel that spins the wheel. time's wounds are wound around a round wheel of willing wakes of worlds of words weaving weals of woven with words within woven worlds who of waking write:  'will we ever stop winding round around our weals wound with wound's time?'. Time, language, loss and trauma are the tines on a fork, of a wheel taking a fractalline snail shell trail of path forth into youth's adult hooded sewn languish and love-addled past. [^R]
[^T]: the manner in which someone behaves towards or deals with someone or something: the directive required equal treatment for men and women in social security schemes. the presentation or discussion of a subject: comparison with earlier artists is useful which means absolutely pointless because no thing means any thing which means every thing means some thing in analysis of the treatment of women in her painting. informally *(i.e. the full treatment)* used to indicate that something is done enthusiastically, vigorously, or to an extreme degree: a bit of soft-shoe shuffle[^S] got the full treatment. medical care given to a patient for an illness or injury: I'm receiving what they call residential treatment for a psychiatric illness that seems to, by the nature of the microcosm of this restrictive modality of not-living reflecting the macrocosm of transphobic society, be making me worse rather than better.  anti-cancer treatments. a session of beauty or healthcare: electrolysis treatments often form some of the most painful and expensive aspects of an MtF gender transition, in which a needle is inserted into every hair-bearing follicle of the face for either as long as the treatment sessions last or for as long as the patient can bear. the use of a chemical, physical, or biological agent to preserve or give particular properties to something: the treatment of hazardous waste is particularly expensive.
[^S]: **A type of dance**. A soft-shoe shuffle is a dance that originated in vaudeville and music halls in the early 20th century. It's a comic dance performed by tap dancers wearing soft-soled shoes, called soft-shoes, instead of their regular tap shoes. The shoes are rubbed on the stage, sometimes covered with sand to amplify the sound, creating a characteristic "swish".[^sw]
[^sw]: The accompanying music is usually soft, with many silent moments so the dancer's sound can be heard. **Unsee also:**  The Soft Shoe Shuffle is an interactive dialogue exercise based on a theme.[^Th] The exercise helps people reassign meaning, process information and experiences, and learn to understand complex matters. It also helps people think flexibly and dialectically, looking at problems from different points of view.
[^Th]: theme | θiːm | noun 1 the subject of a talk, piece of writing, exhibition, etc.; a topic: the theme of the sermon was reverence. • Linguistics the first major constituent of a clause, indicating the subject matter, typically being the subject but optionally other constituents, as in ‘smitten he is not’. Contrasted with Rheme [^Rh] *US English* an essay written by perhaps an intelligent school pupil (who may be experiencing a series of unfortunately traumatic and isolating events leading them to fold in on themselves into existential fractals of obsession with words in books on themes of cycles and trauma in a desparate attempt to make meaning from these inherently unfair events rendering their work unintelligible to neurotypical [^NT] mentors and individuals in their cohort) on a particular subject. *The Arts*: an idea that recurs in or pervades a work of art or literature (i.e. infinity, fractal recursion, and the ontological nature of linguistics in a feedback loop with creation of ideas and form, are recurring themes in Borges' work, often inclusive of intensely confusing meta-narrative [^Me] structures which force the reader into existential inquiry through the subsequent collapse of the programmed egoic self via the discombobulating nature[^N!] of the story's media. **In Media:* *Res*erved mostly for usage as a modifier**: A piece of music that frequently recurs in or accompanies the beginning and end of a film, play, or musical: a theme song. i.e. 'the theme song in the netflix[^Ne] series A Series of Unfortunate Events (which was foreshadowed in the musical staves printed within additional material such as An Unauthorised Autobiography supporting the main narrative in the books that the series of events in a series of unfortunate events was based on) is a piece of music bookending each episode in the series which are based on a theme of unfortunate events, which occur in series of recursive cycles of unfortunate events, both begetting and overwriting previous unfortunate events in series'[^Se] . • **Music**: a prominent or frequently recurring melody or group of notes in a composition: the first violin takes up the theme high up in its register. •  a setting given to a restaurant, pub, or leisure venue, intended to evoke a particular country, historical period, culture, etc.: an Irish theme pub. 4 Linguistics the stem of a noun or verb; the part to which inflections are added, especially one composed of the root and an added vowel. 5 historical any of the twenty-nine provinces in the Byzantine empire. verb: give a particular theme or setting to (a leisure venue, event, etc.): the amusement park will be themed as a Caribbean pirate stronghold. ORIGIN Middle English: via Old French from Latin thema, from Greek, literally ‘proposition’; related to *tithenai* ‘to set or place’.
[^R]: The recursive nature of the cycles that we are all in as life forms, all the way down to the subatomic layer, up to the cellular cycle, down to the anatomical cycles of our body, hormonal cycles; the relationship cycles that we go through, the rotational and self-perpetuating trauma that we perpetuate in each other, and obviously the planetary cycles, and then maybe even, the ultimate dreamer [^Br], who is actually in the middle of the quarks that we can't split. And maybe the waking up is that idea I was talking about of that so-called next level of consciousness, which is that we all form constituent sinemes, if you will, like individual consciousness components of a whole greater consciousness that we aren't actually aware of, just as cells aren't aware of the name of the person of the body that they are actually in.
[^Ne]:*A streaming** service***: **A word which here means an alternative but self-similar modality of experiencing either music or media, or a river which returns to the sea to be cycled back to the sky to be rained down into as the tears may stream from a human being's face or from an animal forced against its will into traumatic experiments conducted upon them for the frivolous purposes of the synthesis of cosmetic products such as baby shampoo bearing the subtitle: 'no tears!' in a deeply unfortunate series of non-consensual events of animal cruelty
[^ser]:A word which does not here mean 'serving the greater good' but may or may absolutely not mean 'service of worship of a higher power' here
[^Br]: Who some constituents of this dreamlike story we are all characters in may call Brahma. The Sanskrit root bṛh- connects Brahma with themes of growth, expansion, and creative force, echoing ancient Indo-European concepts of “breath” as life energy. The Sanskrit root _bṛh-_ (also _vṛh-_ or _bṛṃh-_), meaning “to grow, expand, or strengthen,” paradoxically encompasses both expansion and removal, creation and destruction. It also signifies “to roar,” connecting back to sound as a primal originator. Like Brahma, who maybe snores while dreaming existence into cycles, or perhaps screams upon waking from this endless nightmare, _bṛh-_ embodies the resonance of creation—an endless roaring breath that fills, forms, and dismantles worlds in rhythmic cycles of expansion and dissolution.
[^Desi]: The term _desi_ originates from the Sanskrit word _deśa_, meaning “country” or “land,” and refers to people or cultural elements from the Indian subcontinent, especially India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. It is not inherently a religious or holy term; instead, it conveys a cultural and regional identity. People often use _desi_ to celebrate and identify elements of shared heritage, such as cuisine, music, traditions, and language, among South Asian communities globally.
[^Rh]: Linguistics** the part of a clause that gives information about the theme. ORIGIN late 19th century: from Greek rhēma ‘that which is said’. Rhymes with *Ream* [^Re]
[^Re]: **Ream** | _noun_, _verb_ | \ˈrēm\ As a _noun_, “ream” signifies a quantity of paper, traditionally equating to 500 sheets. Its etymology traces to the Arabic _rizmah_, meaning “bundle” or “package.” i.e. 'the bundle of paper was smooth to the touch' or 'the recursive narrative was a smooth journey through themes of love, loss, grief, and the Iteratively Inevitable Impossibility of Informations Interpolation with Identity' As a _verb_, “ream” takes on an opposing, rougher, coarser usage. It may mean “to bore a hole through” or “to apply intense pressure.” To “ream someone out” specifically refers to delivering a severe reprimand or scolding. i.{i.e.}e. 'the author reamed out the reader with reams upon reams of dreamlike sequences of words varying yet repeatedly reaming the theme of recursion on a theme of Eventually Existential and Unfortunately Unavoidable themes on a theme of thematics'[^Them]
[^Them]: thematic | θiːˈmatɪk, θɪˈmatɪk | adjective 1 having or relating to subjects or a particular subject: the book is organized into nine thematic chapters.relating to the collecting of postage stamps with designs connected with the same subject. "for the thematic collector volcanoes represent a treasure trove. Music relating to or containing melodic subjects: the concerto relies on the frequent repetition of thematic fragments.[^Frag]
[^Frag]: Linguistics relating to or denoting the theme of a sentence: some languages use special affixes to mark thematic and non-thematic elements. • relating to the theme of an inflected word. of a vowel connecting the theme of a word to its inflections.(of a word) having a vowel connecting its theme to its inflections. noun 1 (thematics) treated as singular or plural a body of topics for study or discussion: "I soon gave up trying to prime him with the thematics of the piece and instead descended into incessant fractals of footnotes." a postage stamp forming part of a set with designs connected with the same subject. Also called topical [^To] ORIGIN late 17th century:from Greek thematikos, from thema - *Theme* [^Th]
[^To]: A subject particularly relevant or pertinent to the moment or theme of events the character in a story which is a fictional account of their lived experience which is non-fictional in its subjectivity of perception which is the only reality any character in any story has as a frame of Reference [^Re]
[^Re]: A citation in a bibliography[^B] or academic paper in which the writer suggests to the reader that they have been iterating through cycles of acquiring knowledge through the chain[^Ch] of previous writers writing their own stories redefining or iterating through the overarching cycle of the communication of ideas connected through their categorisation into a complementary theme of study
[^Se]: Series: a chain[^Ch], such as 'a chain of events' or 'Throughout the series of history of media, such as literature and Television Series, Transgender individuals have been historically painted as a villainous, wicked, outsider population through the concept of in group-out group psychology[^IO]'
[^IO]: Perhaps once a protective form of sociological containment to ensure bonds between constituent members of a stratum, for the purposes of preventing the interaction with an external threat (be it outwithintra-species, (in(out in)without group) or inwithouter-species (out(in, out)within group) in nature) but, through the iterative passage[^P] of a series of self-propagating events perceived subjectively as temporally linear, and the enantiodromic[^E] evolution of both human intelligence and ignorance, continues to cause a disproportionate amount of harm until the real meaning of minerva fighting mars is found through their own vehicle be it an empty chariot with a lion's head door knocker that looks more like a sabre tooth tiger until you look at the same thing a little differently, or a train, or a plane, or a car, or a star, or the wind, or the trees, or through you, or through me, i do not like myself, I am. I do knot like them's am, I am.
[^P]: The movement[^Move] of a substance, either as a source of nourishment or a burdensome load to be excreted or both simultaneously or neither or for the purposes of sensory pleasure for one party and simultaneous agony for the other [^Swine] through a lumen, or channel[^Ch], or digestive tract
[^Swine]: **Swine Objection**: This critique (by philosophers such as Immanuel Kant and John[[Dear John Letter]] Stuart Mill) of **hedonistic utilitarianism** (a framework which was a cage conceptualised by Jeremy Bentham) argues that if pleasure alone defines morality, it reduces human pursuits to mere physical gratification, akin to animalistic behaviour, without distinguishing morally 'higher' values (which may or may not be considered equal by others). i.e. "we are reducing ourselves to the base behavioural delicacies of swine" For example, consider a woman or person experiencing repeated non-consensual harm by a group deriving pleasure (whether indirectly or not) from her/their suffering. i.{i.e.}e. *"you all unknowingly or not fucked my heart without my consent with your neglect and abandonment like my rapist raped my body, you fucking swine"* The swine objection highlights how a simplistic hedonistic view of pleasure could dangerously ignore the inherent immorality in such actions. Under a utilitarian approach solely valuing pleasure, these perpetrators’ enjoyment could, in theory, count as morally acceptable—an implication Mill’s differentiation of pleasures seeks to address by underscoring that 'higher' moral values such as dignity and respect, hold intrinsic worth beyond mere sensory 'pleasure'.
[^E]: Relating to Enantiodromia[^En]
[^En]: The concept that an abundance of any force can cause an opposite reaction, subtly different from Newton's Third Law which states that *every* action, no matter the magnitude or abundance, has an equal and opposite reaction. Enantiodromia refers to the nature of extremes, in their amplitude, as peaks[^Pe] of a harmonic wave, and their tendency to beget their complementary yet opposite natures, in a dance with the overall theme of bringing a horizon of balance.
[^Pe]: The highest point of an individual mountain, which may or may not form part of a mountain range. '** in *A Series of Unfortunate Events*, Mount Fraught** is the highest peak in the Mortmain Mountains. Its frozen waterfall is notorious for being Stricken Stream's headwater [^H].  It is a river that only flows if the ice is pierced for a number of times. a projecting [^Pr] part or shape. **A Sample, or smaller component of a complete Meringue Recipe, which itself is a component in the ever evolving series of events leading to the acquisition of knowledge through the transmission of information on culinary science[^C]
[^Peak]:Crack two eggs and place them into a bowl, forming one homogenous plasma. Then whisk this single substance formed of two self-same components to stiff peaks" _verb_: reach a highest point, either of a specified value or at a specified time. Kurtosis is sometimes confused with a measure of the peakedness of a distribution. However,[^kurt]
[^kurt]:kurtosis is a measure that describes the shape of a distribution's tails in relation to its overall shape**. A distribution can be sharply peaked with low kurtosis, and a distribution can have a lower peak with high kurtosis.
[^H]: The headwaters of a river are **the smaller streams near its source, which combine to form the river**, constituent fractions of the ever-changing but overall self-similar Body of Water being composed of the same properties, molecular, physical, and thermodynamic, as the whole. See: Synecdoche.
[^C]: The Art of Baking, which is also a Science, which is also an Artful Science, which forms a particularly methodological particle[^Part] in the overall Scientific Art of Cooking food for the purposes of nourishing the (usually either a single human or group of humans as either an expression of love or a Begrudgingly Burdensome necessity, but not always) Body [^Bo]
[^NT]: NT: an acronym which here and there and everywhere denotes an individual of the majority of humans with a neurological network of brain cells performing roles in a canonical [^Ca] modality [^Mo]
[^Ca]:Ca: the chemical symbol for Calcium, which provides the main biomolecular constituent of a snail shell exhibiting fractal form. But I digress; as this footnote was originally intended as a definition of the word 'Canonical'[^Can] , not the labelling acronym of the footnote itself. See: meta- [^Me]
[^Can]: **Religion:** Generally according to or ordered by canon law. i.e. "the canonical funeral rites of the Protestant Church performed for a deceased member of a group who was once a Family" **Theological Literature:** included in the list of sacred books officially accepted as genuine. "the gentle compassion of the God described, spoken to, and narrating the canonical Gospels of the New Testament provide a stark contrast to the coarse and vengeful nature of YHWH depicted in the Old Testament. Both these constituent, unified yet contrasting halves of dualistic Religion are recognised equally in the Eastern †Orthodox Church." **The Awareness of an overall theme of methodology in any theme of study or existence:** accepted as being accurate and authoritative. "the canonical method of comparative linguistics or, comparatively, comparative Religion" Self-Similar: Orthodox† **Of a writer or work** belonging to the literary canon. "the work of canonical writers such as Jorge Luis Borges is reflected in the experimental contemporary works of his contemporaries such as Gabriel García Márquez, the author of 100 Years of Solitude being a fine[^F] example, wherein the cyclical, non-linear structure of time within the Buendía family history mirrors Borges’ fascination with time as a labyrinth, where the trinity[^III] of past, present, and future converge. according to recognized rules or scientific laws. i.e. "canonical nucleotide sequences". Mathematics: relating to a general rule or standard formula. relating to a cathedral chapter or a member of it. "his college tutors were later his canonical colleagues". _noun_ i.e. 'the prescribed official dress of the clergy performing funeral rites for an uncle once distant in emotional relation and physicality now both distant and forever intimately woven in a spiritual manner'
[^Me]:At the beginning of our story which is historically not fiction, our character, who for now, which is never, or for better which is worse, we shall simply call "N", was or is, or will be finalising his scientific paper on Borges' short story _Tløn, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius_. As those cursed enough or indeed gifted enough (as both are one and the same) to have been tasked or to have tasked themselves with the writing of such a tome will know, or have known, the proper treatment[^T] requires one to be entirely consumed by the work, so that eventually, or perhaps causally, the subject matter seeps into all aspects of their life, waking or not. No this is just self indulgent tripe wait no that's exactly it okay so will delete later right now just have to keep going because I don't have long until Moonset but remember rememebr the etymologist might notice echoes or recurrences in life that most people would overlookphrases repeated across contexts, same numbers showing up repeatedly, familiar faces in unexpected places. These recurrences could feel to them like the “inhale” and “exhale” of a larger system, the universe drawing in and releasing energy in a rhythm only they can perceive. Each recurrence would have a slightly different flavor, much like waves in the ocean: similar but never identical. INCLUDE TS REFERENCE
[^Part]:a minute portion of matter. "tiny **particles of** dust upon a coffin of a long-lost but not forgotten uncle whose name constructed of four characters and singular character in this story, collected before his descent and return to the Earth or shared origin from whence we all came as the performer of funeral rites uttered the words echoing countless cycles of stories stretching back to the first syllable of unrecorded time of subjectively experienced human history: 'dust to dust''. Physics: any of numerous subatomic components, photons, and alpha particles. Mathematics: a hypothetical object having mass but no physical size. the least possible amount. "he agrees without hearing the least **particle of** evidence". Similar: *Iota*. Grammar: (in English) any of the class of words such as _in_, _up_, _off_, _over_, used with verbs to make phrasal verbs.
[^D]: 'Delicious' is a wonderful word deriving from 'delicacy' which can both mean a cuisine specifically (and often exclusively) enjoyed by a culture, which can oftentimes be enjoyed by a so-called 'outsider' to an even greater extent relative to said 'outsider's baseline perception of the taste of such, by virtue of its, and their, relative exclusion from their experience. This concept is itself paradoxically dualistic and self-same, as it touches upon the same underlying force that perpetuates fetishisation, as in the fetishisation of Transgender individuals stripping them of their humanity[^Fe]
[^N!]: A similar tactic employed by Noise Artists, such as Lingua Ignota, or Kristen Michael Hayter, who was and is and I suppose therefore always will be a greatly vibrating supercord on the infinitely four dimensional knot on experimental and systems based Word generation and deconstruction to uncover the fundamental paradox underlying all things because to achieve silence you must understand noise and to come to sense see Entantiodromia or CARPVS MORTVVM[^Self]
[^Self]: Self-reference is an example of either meta-narrative[^Me] cleverness or egotistical hubris or perhaps both, and therefore never neither.[^QS] "Mirrors and copulation are abominable, because they increase the numbers of men while decreasing the number of eyes in the world who are looking at something real i.e. their Self: See Goethe's colour theory. *N.B.: "At the beginning of our story which is historically not fiction, our character, who for now, which is never, or for better which is worse, we shall simply call "N"[^N], was or is, or will be finalising his scientific paper on Borges' short story Tløn, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius. As those cursed enough or indeed gifted enough (as both are one and the same) to have been tasked or to have tasked themselves with the writing of such a tome will know, or have known, the proper treatment[^T] requires one to be entirely consumed by the work, so that eventually, or perhaps causally, the subject matter seeps into all aspects of their life, waking or not.*
[^T]: the manner in which someone behaves towards or deals with someone or something: the directive required equal treatment for men and women in social security schemes. the presentation or discussion of a subject: comparison with earlier artists is useful which means absolutely pointless because no thing means any thing which means every thing means some thing in analysis of the treatment of women in her painting. informally *(i.e. the full treatment)* used to indicate that something is done enthusiastically, vigorously, or to an extreme degree: a bit of soft-shoe shuffle[^S] got the full treatment. medical care given to a patient for an illness or injury: I'm receiving what they call residential treatment for a psychiatric illness that seems to, by the nature of the microcosm of this restrictive modality of not-living reflecting the macrocosm of transphobic society, be making me worse rather than better.  anti-cancer treatments. a session of beauty or healthcare: electrolysis treatments often form some of the most painful and expensive aspects of an MtF gender transition, in which a needle is inserted into every hair-bearing follicle of the face for either as long as the treatment sessions last or for as long as the patient can bear. the use of a chemical, physical, or biological agent to preserve or give particular properties to something: the treatment of hazardous waste is particularly expensive as I'm sure is bear hunting.
[^Desi]: The term _desi_ originates from the Sanskrit word _deśa_, meaning “country” or “land,” and refers to people or cultural elements from the Indian subcontinent, especially India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. It is not inherently a religious or holy term; instead, it conveys a cultural and regional identity.

It may mean “to bore a hole through” or “to apply intense pressure.” To “ream someone out” specifically refers to delivering a severe reprimand or scolding. i.{i.e.}e. 'the author reamed out the reader with reams upon reams of dreamlike sequences of words varying yet repeatedly reaming the theme of recursion on a theme of Eventually Existential and Unfortunately Unavoidable themes on a theme of thematics'[^Them]

As those cursed enough or indeed gifted enough (as both are one and the same) to have been tasked or to have tasked themselves with the writing of such a tome will know, or have known, the proper treatment[^T] requires one to be entirely consumed by the work, so that eventually, or perhaps causally, the subject matter seeps into all aspects of their life, waking or not.
[^F]: A word which here means 'fitting into place sufficiently for its purpose', but can also mean 'very good' or 'delicious'[^D] which it does also mean here, but can also refer to the opposite of *Coarse*, as in Salt, as in what Lot's Wife was turned into as a result of his inability to Keep Moving Forward
[^N!]: A similar tactic employed by Noise Artists, such as Lingua Ignota or CARPVS MORTVVM[^Self]
[^Self]: Self-reference is an example of either meta-narrative[^Me] cleverness or egotistical hubris or perhaps both, or neither.[^QS]
[^QS]: Quantum superposition refers to a concept in Quantum Physics in which probabilistic states are interpolated or interlaced upon each other such that a series of potential events (whether unfortunate or not) may occur together, not occur at all, differentially occur in a distribution[^K] ,
[^Fe]: Fe is the chemical symbol for Iron, a major component of the biomolecule 'Heme' which carries oxygen about the bloodstream through the lumen of veins (travelling *into, towards* the heart, or Centre of Love of Contractual Compassion) or arteries (travelling *away from* or out of the heart, or Cardiac Pump of autonomic and unfeeling contractile spasm) to ensure healthy distribution of oxygenated tissues via a relationship of exchange with the lung's semi-permeable membranes, which are septa or separations required for unification of the whole. To sever an artery is much more likely to be lethal than the severance of a vein; i.e. "the transgender woman pushed to suicidal ideation due to the lack of spiritual or supportive framework necessitating her understanding of Death as not just a physical process but more importantly (and multiple in its occurrence within a single individual's life) a spiritual and egotistical one, attempted to sever her brachial vein in vain" or "the anaesthesiologist who was also the canonical[^Can] Organist of the Glasgow Cathedral injected the general[^Gen] anaesthesia containing fentanyl, for the purposes of allowing her to withstand the incising and peeling forward of her scalp over her eyes like a shroud of flesh, in order for the surgeon to debride[^De] the organic inauthenticity encapsulated in the curvature of her cranial vault[^CV] in vein"
[^K]: K is the quite-widely known yet seemingly counterintuitive chemical symbol for Potassium - historically rooted in the substance *Potash*, which itself originates from the Middle Dutch _potaschen_, denoting "pot ashes"[^PA] in 1477, a perfect symbol for the alchemical process of obtaining worth from the supposedly (erroneously) worthless "dead head" or *Caput Mortuum* of a substance. An archaic method for the synthesis of Potassium Carbonate (a molecular trinity of the two aforementioned elements in a two-to-one relationship along with Oxygen in triplicate - K2CO3). The Symbol 'K' derives from Potassium and calcium have a complex relationship, such as in the balancing act of Calcium in The Body; wherein Potassium can increase calcium balance in the body by reducing the amount of calcium excreted in urine; in vascular calcification (which is a buildup of calcium in the lumen of the walls or boundaries or containing membranes of arteries that can lead to atherosclerosis) whereby Potassium may provide a protective role.
[^III]: (((See also and also and also as One: Triple Goddess)))
[^PA]: as in, ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
[^De]: **debridement** is a crucial step in wound care, particularly for burns, ulcers, or traumatic injuries, where cleaning out the wound helps healthy tissue to regenerate and improves overall recovery outcomes. It also refers to a dental process that involves abrading the surface of the enamel of the dental bones [^DB] (exposed and therefore vulnerable, yet very strong, fit for purpose, and useful in their exposure) which are with a medical device, ,
[^DB]: Components of the anatomy used to devour delicacies, or historically, tear the flesh from the bones of so-called 'lower' forms of life, in a dance of death and survival that stretches back in a chain of events both fortunate and unfortunate for both 'us' and 'them'.
[^CV]: The **cranial vault** (also called the **calvaria** or **skullcap**) is the upper part of the skull that encases and protects the brain. It consists of several flat bones that are joined together by sutures[^Su] , which are fibrous joints allowing for some movement[^Move] and flexibility during development and growth.
[^Su]: Sutures as in stitches, whether they be ligatures of bone woven into our genome from the origin of our birth which holds its origin in the first recorded syllable of not just human but all pseudolife[^Ps] , microbiological organismic life
[^Ps]: a term often used to describe viruses or the self-replicating apparently thoughtlessly cycling RNA[^RNA] molecules thought to be the initial members of the series of fortunate or unfortunate (and neither and both) [^QS] events leading to you reading these reams [^Re] of recursively reaming characters of words forming letters of this fictional or non-fictional (and neither and both) [^QS] story of characters.
[^RNA]: RNA is a precursor and now fundamental complementary dance partner, child and parent of DNA, the code formed of components in a chain of complimentary pairs of molecules bound together, forming a chain of cycles of evolutionary series of events leading to you reading these reams [^Re] of recursively reaming characters (such as 'U') of words forming letters of this fictional or non-fictional (and neither and both) [^QS] story of characters (such as 'you').
[^Move]: The motion of a Body composed of self-same parts to a different position through space, or, a collective[^Col] census or themed[^th]
[^N]:The chemical symbol for the most abundant component of the atmosphere, part of a cycle known as the Nitrogen cycle. Capitailsed (N): equals the size of the population. Lowercase *(n)*: how many of the subset sample[^sample] from said population were chosen as the sample size. a recursive symbol for a variable or an anonymous entity. As in "I have read this work N times and still can make heads nor tails of it"
[^sample]:A collected fraction of a greater substance, such as the abstract of a long, meandering academic paper on a fictional city becoming non-fictional written by a character in a city that may or may not be non-fictional becoming
[^mis]: *Mis en abyme* is a term which means "*placed into the abyss*", in which an artist places a copy of an image or idea within itself, suggesting recursion *ad infinitim*[^adinf]
[^adinf]: or "continue forever, without limit", as in, the placement of an image, idea, or spirit of a long dead write, clawing through the letters of a series of deeply recursive and cursed footnotes, between two mirrors which may be metaphysical mirrors of the self or empirical in nature or both, placed facing one another, in parallel, creating an infinite recursion of an image, idea, or spirit of not dead but perhaps not entirely real author of words, between two mirrors [^mis]
[^Fmd]:"foot and note disease" is a derogation coined by John Betjeman
[^adinf]: or "continue forever, without limit", as in, the placement of an image, idea, or spirit of a long dead write, clawing through the letters of a series of deeply recursive and cursed footnotes, between two mirrors which may be metaphysical mirrors of the self or empirical in nature or both, placed facing one another, in parallel, creating an infinite recursion of an image, idea, or spirit of not dead but perhaps not entirely real author of words, between two mirrors [^mis] i.e. "Mirrors and copulation are abominable, because they increase the numbers of men" -N, At the beginning of our story which is historically not fiction, our character, who for now, which is never, or for better which is worse, we shall simply call "Borges"[^N.B.], was or is, or will be finalising his scientific paper on Borges' short story _Tløn, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius_. As those cursed enough or indeed gifted enough (as both are one and the same) to have been tasked or to have tasked themselves with the writing of such a tome will know, or have known, the proper treatment[^T] requires one to be entirely consumed by the work, so that eventually, or perhaps causally, the subject matter seeps into all aspects of their life, waking or not.
[^Desi]: The term _desi_ originates from the Sanskrit word _deśa_, meaning “country” or “land,” and refers to people or cultural elements from the Indian subcontinent, especially India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. It is not inherently a religious or holy term; instead, it conveys a cultural and regional identity.People often use _desi_ to celebrate and identify elements of shared heritage, such as cuisine, music, traditions, and language, among South Asian communities globally.
[^Se]: Series: a chain[^Ch], such as 'a chain of events' or 'Throughout the series of history of media, such as literature and Television Series, Transgender individuals have been historically painted as a villainous, wicked, outsider population through the concept of in group-out group psychology[^IO]
[^IO]: Perhaps once a protective form of sociological containment to ensure bonds between constituent members of a stratum, for the purposes of preventing the interaction with an external threat (be it intra-species, (within group) or inter-species (outwith group) in nature) but, through the iterative passage[^P] of a series of self-propagating events perceived subjectively as temporally linear, and the enantiodromic[^E] evolution of both human intelligence and ignorance, has found its uselessness within this perhaps-once-functionality
[^Pe]: The highest point of an individual mountain, which may or may not form part of a mountain range. '** in *A Series of Unfortunate Events*, Mount Fraught** is the highest peak in the Mortmain Mountains. Its frozen waterfall is notorious for being Stricken Stream's headwater [^H].  It is a river that only flows if the ice is pierced for a number of times. a projecting [^Pr] part or shape. A Sample, or smaller component of a complete Meringue Recipe, which itself is a component in the ever evolving series of events leading to the acquisition of knowledge through the transmission of information on culinary science[^C]
[^Cr]:Crack two eggs and place them into a bowl, forming one homogenous plasma. Then whisk this single substance formed of two self-same components to stiff peaks" _verb_: reach a highest point, either of a specified value or at a specified time. Kurtosis is sometimes confused with a measure of the peakedness of a distribution. However, **kurtosis is a measure that describes the shape of a distribution's tails in relation to its overall shape**. A distribution can be sharply peaked with low kurtosis, and a distribution can have a lower peak with high kurtosis.
[^ago]: *That means, at some point which was apparently 'ago' but the word 'ago' can be broken down into 'a' as in, one constituent of a whole system, such as you/I, or Him, and "go" i.e. to either leave, or arrive, or both or actually not neither, at or to or from or backwards from or within to a place or even maybe the worst which is actually the best meaning, which is without. -*
[^chain]:*or thread made up of fractionally smaller threads, making paradoxically a much stronger thread together by separating more and more -*
[^N.B.]: Or, Not Borges.
