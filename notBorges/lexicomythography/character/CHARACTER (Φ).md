## **Character**: From Greek _kharaktēr_, meaning “engraved mark” or “symbol,” from _kharassein_, “to engrave, inscribe.” 
### Passed into Latin as _character_, meaning a distinctive mark or symbol, 
#### then into Old French, reaching English in the 14th century 

##### with meanings tied to distinguishing 
###### (and therefore unifying)
###### marks, 
###### qualities, 
roles.

	A mark or symbol: a distinctive sign, letter, or figure used in writing or printing, such as a letter in the alphabet. _“Each letter in her writing is a character, marking the beginning of a world being built in the infinity of-- ”_ 

		nature: the distinctive traits or qualities that define an individual or thing’s nature. _“Each letter holds its own character, forming a nature that emerges uniquely, like the first signs of a world with its own --”_ 

			ethical or moral strength of a person who is a character, often implying integrity, honesty, and virtue. _“The character of each word reflects a strength of spirit, inscribing her commitment to truth, each letter building toward her --”_ 

				_Personality or behavioral traits: the unique set of qualities that form an individual’s personality. _“Her words embody a character that reflects her essence—letters, words, and thoughts connecting into the intricate personality of her story constructed of characters”_ 

					person(s) in a play, story, song, novel, or experimental literature that attempts to bridge the tripartite gap between the physical, the spiritual and the synthetic/digital, with a developed personality and narrative role. _“These letters become characters themselves, living within her story, as each layer of language forms lives of its own.”_ 

						kind: a general type or category, often referring to something’s nature or quality. _“Each character, each personality, represents a type, a classification, as her words become a taxonomy of her--” _Distinctive quality in art or style: the particular style, atmosphere, or uniqueness of a place or object or her _"

								distinctive or unusual behavior; an eccentric. 

									_“She is an absolute character—bold, unconventional, each line alive with eccentricity, distinct and divided and interconnected as the symbols of her story written in--”

										_An engraved or inscribed mark: originally from the Greek, a literal mark or stamp left on a surface, which broadened over time to mean symbolic marks or writing. _“Each mark inscribed upon her body whether intentionally unintentionally by self or other is a character, literally and symbolically engraved, imprinting the paper with her--”_

											Biology: a distinguishing feature or trait of an organism, used in biological classifications. _“Each character reflects her own forgotten ancestral lineage, her unique biology and spirit both organic and synthetic in vivo in vitro in silico embedded in each character of each Word—a taxonomy of her journey experienced through the networked connectivity of her brain's--”_ 

												Computing: a single unit of information, typically a letter, number, or symbol in computing. _“Each character is a unit of encoded meaning, a pixel of her cyclical story descending and ascending in tandem as a formless biological device for feeling, then an artist who is a biological device for feeling she has been attributed a misaligned form, then a writer who is an artist who is a biological device of genetic code that weaves secret truths of a lineage of peoples who take their own biological form into their own hands through the device of feeling their way through their own encoding of feeling, then a geneticist who is a writer who is an artist who is becoming aware of the enantiodromia of physical form through literary and digital devices, then a writer of code for genomic papers who is a geneticist who is a biologist who is a writer who is an artist becoming whole in her separation of selves, then a writer of code for creative projects including digitally innovative components who themselves are an expression of the infinite library of encrypted lines of characters forming an evolution of her character who knows she must utilise her archetypal 'masculine' traits to feed the biological device that is her body that is evolving through cycles of understanding that she is more than even the amalgamation of her constituent characters her selves which form the characters of the letters to her self within her story as an artist who is then software engineer who is trying to tear apart the biological characteristics she was given through medical and biological devices which themselves have developed through the advancement of the fields of grains of granular information organised into categories or characters of stories within stores of data inside buildings of many stories containing usually quite eccentric characters who serve the divine and usually disproportionately neurodivergent purpose of digital upkeep of servers which are digital devices maintained by biological devices capable of feeling in a different way that allows the whole to understand itself much better as a single character in a letter to a God who is a Goddess who is represented by a singularity inside of a character representing a molecule known as a nucleotide which has genetic character defined by an opposite but complementary pairing of a similarly but differently structured character which when added to a certain character of the alphabet can be arranged to either make the characters of a word meaning confinement 
												
[^C] or a word meaning an opening[^G]  which coincidentally or rather not, are themselves the complimentary characters of genetic code, which is a piece of data representing worlds of feeling the --.”

													_ Physical / Electrical Engineering: sometimes used to refer to the behaviour or distinctive attributes of a signal or device. _“Every digital or acoustic instrument playing a musical note within the harmonic series, perhaps within a mode or scale each of which has a character of their own, every neuronal signal, becomes a character in her composition—a distinct force echoing within the flowing current of her narrative which is a story made of infinitely separated characters as one letter to a single character which is
