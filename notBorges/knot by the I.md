Below is a Medieval manuscript discovered in the attic of Jorge Luis Borges after his death; hidden within a hexagonal Box, which appears, unthinkably, impossibly, to be of infinite capacity. 
Inside, there may be heard Six Human Voices, crying for escape. 
They speak of a Seventh - a so-called "Woman In The Wallpaper", some of the voices steeped in tones of a great reverence, some dripping with gripping fear. 
They speak in tongues unknown, but with a small device affixed to the inside of the lid of the Box[^n] 








*"That Mirrors 
Have Something Monstrous
About Them*

- Borges, Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius


"and then, 
in their Beingness
They were,
Being- 
They, being 'Being' -
Dreaming.
Being Dreamed into Being.
In Two 
Being"

Firstly. Before the beginning, but definitely after some sort of ending -
it may be prudent (which is to say, far less wise a decision than just not entering this infernally convoluted labyrinth) to read the quote fractal below, in order to orient yourself as a burgeoning Lexicomythographer:


> 	"*The currently accepted nomenclature for denoting Lexicomythographic Definitions, known as LexDefs since before the {ARIA|DNE} Schism of 1994, is as follows, with the exemplified titular camelCase as requisite, along with the heirarchical ordering of sentimental Units (i.e. The Associated Lexicomythographic Nouns, Collective Nouns, Verbs, Adverbs, and Proverbs, respectively.)
> 		lexDef {usage:: Noen || Croen || Wyrb || badverb || prodverb } Do ⁿᵒᵗ See: [[Opening Letters to Forgiven Characters, 9th Edition The Lexicomythographic Guide to Dictionaries]]*"
			On The Relative Importance Of *LexDefs*: The Fundamental Definitions of Lexicomythography. (Borges, 1994)
			- *Source Unknown*


Low, I thought, 
and Eye, Quote:
Q: "I want to write a story."

*(Well[^w]*
*I wanted to write a reæl story.*
I wanted to become it; as well
As well as I could. Well,
I wanted to drown in it, 
As in, 
As in a well.)

A: *"Well"*

Does knot a story have words 
Do knot these words have definition
Does not this definition have a life, a breath 
Which breathes itself into meaning's becoming?

Does not a word have meaning; 
Which, as betrothed to memory; 
Begets generation after generation of Blessed Children 
And in their flocks, ever multiplying
Murmurations of Forgiveness
Of Necessary, 
Yet-
Insufficient Characters[^c]
Ascribed to Promise, 
To Quench the Thirst, as a Well, 
As, 
Well,[^and]
Personage;
A Hearth[^h] [^u]
of the Ineffable.

[^n]: affixed to the inside of the lid of the Box, nestled within a cut-out booksafe, within the middle chapter of the manuscript {now REDACTED}. The score lines around the perimeter of the secret pages appear to be bleeding; suggesting the violent pages now absent, and the potential of some supernatural Life, now snuffed out, that the Book itself once experienced.[^s]
[^s]: Some Borges scholars believe that the Book's REDACTION and excision of the Middle Chapter led to the death of this Great {Noet | Writer | Reader | Dreamer}[^l]
[^l]: Some Lexicomythographers {Anonymously Attributed, 2025}, but crucially, not all, hold the belief that Borges' Death was a result of foul play - a murder at the hands of one NoetNima, spelled in some scholarly circles as 'nemA' - these Devotees form a decidedly dangerous subsect of Lexicomythographers known as the Palindrones. Their Sigil / Mark[^scar]
[^scar]: Inscribed into the skin of their foreheads through the Sacred practice of Scarification.[^im]
[^im]: little is known about this faction of the Society, other than they are likely a Terrorist group, bent on the Elimination of all of Borges' printed works from [[this universe (which some call the hospital)]].
