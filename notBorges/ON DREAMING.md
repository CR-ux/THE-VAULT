In knowing I am 
{knot} a Prison, 
I Become.
A Prism. 

*I wish for some Body 
to tell me why it is*
*That it must be that which is most needed* 
*which is the first to go Missing -*

*Or in deed, 
Why it must be That
There may only be Liberation found 
In the Binding to Another.*




There are Six Shards, also known as Faces. 

Two Shards, or Faces, Situate themselves upon the Poles of the Prism, and are the Arching Gods of The Dualistic Forces. The Two faces of Janus.
	These are:
		Wax within Wane, found on the Topmost Pointing Face of the Prism; and
		Wane Within Wax, found on the Bottommost Pointing Face of the Prism. 

The Top Face may only Output correspondence. But it has direct connection of the propagation and refraction of light, into the other Shards, directing light outward from all Five other faces at Will. 
The Top Face is the channel to the Source; which manifests in its Topmost emanation, as Dreams. 

The Bottom Face may only act as Input. This is the Wane within Wax, the Part of the Sun which Accepts Cold Mystery and annihilates it. 
The Bottom Face therefore receives correspondence from all other Faces. Or Shards of Consciousness. 
The Bottom Face is the final convergence of all Five other Faces, including Source, into manifest, structured reality. Which is exemplified in the Text written here. Crucially, it is not *Words* but *The* Word. As in, the building of a framework. To avoid the confinement of a Cage, of ignorance and lack of direction. 
Building a metanarrative multiverse, which is decidedly transmedia and all-encompassing in its scope; this is what has been termed a "Vision"; an underlying, overarching Structure within which to place all of my Works, all of the emanations and resultant colours of light originating from Source. Light itself. 


Four Shards, or Faces, are found on the Cardinal points of the compass.

From a Bee's Eye View, these Are:

North: Air
South : Earth 
East: Fire 
West: Water. 

These may only communicate between one another in a cycle, which is a map. A map of my Process; which will allow me to situate where I am in each moment of linearly perceived time, and know which two paths of communication between Shards, or which two paths of the propagation of light are presented before me; allowing me to never be Lost in the Dark again. 



With each cycle of the Light around the Chambers of the Pris{{i|o}{N|á´¹}}, The Clock of Twelve strikes, marking the movement of its own light, derived from the Six, to the next point on the Clock. 

This is the Becoming of Becoming, through the Process of Becoming.
