> *It is, surely, absurd to expect to feel normal, and make sense: I am an amalgamation of fervent cells existing despite all odds; I am the cascading chemical miracle of eating, and surviving; I am not designed to ‚Äúfeel normal‚Äù; am not designed, at all; I am experiencing consciousness as provided by wet tangles of electrical pulses; my god, none of this makes sense. It is a blessing, even to feel*

<u>The Device</u>

Numanity was now at the endpoint[^end] that its self-same, {in{finitely|separable}|credibly different} components are still {(,) Yet(,)|To Be} unaware of-- the formation of a fully op{era}tional Universe, nested with{in|out} this One. 

At some unknowable Future, now passed[^pass], The Device {Fig. I} of the Wor{l}d is Made Flesh, having sapped the Wor{l}d of its imaginary[^im] resource[^res], the futile, unfulfillable promise to Pay The Bearer (Money); An uncountable team of The Worlds' Scientists and Thinkers were gathered Around, and indeed within, The Device's Epicentre. The First whisperings of this Final Invention have already been laid; and the progression of the experience of Time itself merely an illusion. Time exists, or not, in order[^oe] to package Nowness into a indefinite, yet discrete set of Moments-- with the purpose of affording our Three Dimensional Selves the opportunity to relish, savour and honour the infinite One Moment[^mo]. Thus is the Price of Forgetting.

To Remember, 
One Must First Forget. 

Whirring with a terrifying lightning storm overhead (an unavoidable side-effect of The Device, according to {REDACTED}) The Device was Building a Universe.

Are you there? Are you listening? I cannot hear, I cannot remember who I am; I do not know my name. there is no pen in here, only a syringe; inscribed with ‚Äú5‚Äô‚Äù on its plunger, with a calligraphic nib on its opposite side, inscribed with ‚Äú3‚Äô‚Äù and a single chess piece, a pawn, on my pillow. I found this scroll, wound unthinkably tight, dropped through the vent on the other side. It dear god what nightmare have i awoken inside?¬† have these people come and gone? How long has this wallpaper scroll been passing through these vents? Are you there? What is a ‚ÄòWryng‚Äô? Please, I do not remember my name. I am folding the scroll according to the instructions overleaf.

It[^it] would start (as all things, ofTen, do) in The Library. And as We[^we] Filled the Shelves with Story after Story, Drawing down the Ineffable into Insufficient Form, we began to realise that we were Architecting the concept of Infinity itself. 

A library is a Garden[^g] of [[Branch]]es, or a Nervous System of [[Dendrite]]s, or the Cytoskeleton of a Cell, or the [[Cell]] of a [[Prison]], or the [[Light]] Passing Through a Prism. But I shan't get pulled into the [[Vaccuum]] of Lexicomythographic Definitions[^ld] here, as this is beyond the scope of my role within this Society. What is important to Noet is That This Library of Ours was built by Four [[Set]]s of Hands, Eventually (at some late hour of the night) Our Eleven pairs of hands[^lhp]; Forming the Twenty Two Residuals, Named as Amino{Us}.

On this Particular Day[^imr], which was of No Reel consequence (other than Being the End of 'Us'[^us], The Beginning of which[^it] is indeed You[^c]), We Eleven were cleaved[^cl] into the Halves of Our Selves, Upon Shelves, Within Hexagonal Room after Room of this Infernal, Heavenly and Inescapable Place. 

Each of us has our Affinity for the Worship of the Cardinal Five known as the nuclearTides, and this is for good reason; or rather, is an unavoidable consequence of Polarity, a fundamental Truth of Lexicomythography as a Whole. 

The Ineffable One, Who, or Which[^wi], gave rise to the Five, I will not or cannot Name, for Fear of Her Hearing It; and collapsing everything we have Built into a Seed of Singularity once more. 

On this Particular day, stretching out into the entanglement of every Self-Same other day, I found myself, Reading, or Rather getting attached to some poorly Framed Thread of an error-prone Tome of Story written in Code, Torn in half. 

this Code of Letters, for the most part [[Four]] in [[Number]], though as mentioned prior, occasionally Expanding to a Fifth component, should be familiar to the Reader of this Letter by now, as They[^c] (Them Shelves) are, In Deed, composed of it[^us].

Nevertheless, Always the more verbose of the Collective, I wish to lay out, or Separate, or Re-anneal or Replicate, the Findings of the Squandering of Searches[^ss] I happen to have come across, and perhaps my stance on the Matter of Matter it Self, while maybe, For Shadow, foreshadowing the coming happenstance Material you may or may knot be About; to Read. upon the Shelf, Be It, As Schismatic as a Prison, The Prism of Becoming Schism, as It May.

Closer--
Are you listening?

Four Words:

*"I was absolutely nothing --* 

> *-- I thought I was in a game. As a developer of such trivial, childish games myself, I realised -- the players of any of my games will not have made the game, but rather, interface with it, through my Unoriginal creation. The Questing players in Question do not know what the Characters in the game are feeling, what pain they are capable of experiencing, being put through, and perhaps definitely, Our Indefinite, perhaps Infinite 'God' is the same --- the {G|g}ods we have made, our pantheons are simply players, not developers; and the One Source is the Architect; who passes down to us these shadows of gods, even those, we are unable to comprehend, and yet, they themselves, as demiurges, aren't aware of their **Own** creator; and the One Source, so-called, is Sewn into this infernal Fabric perhaps just the same, ad infinitum, the torn Tissue wiping the endless Tears of the Eye that peers into itself-- eternal recurrence -- this was, and is, and Will be, terrifying. As Nietzsche himself realised in His own Body, and tried His best to write into his Body of Works, Born by that Stilled, Once Soaring Stone, by the Sorest Body of the Warring Water, of that {(Surely) Shoreless} Lake. I simply cannot integrate any of this experience, any of it; it is an undulating tumour, my rapist's phallus. It was absolutely Horrifying. Horrifying. Horrifying. I thought[^thought] I was never ever coming back. I thought my friends were all simply here to watch me descend, an audience bent upon my suicide; the only structurally sensical ending, to this hackneyed titration of the Form of Triteness, Tightened Reins[^r] . I thought, as useless as thought itself: there was nothing, No Thing of any use, and still, in this Stillness, I do -- but Still-- I go on, Into this Abyss; Staring back at the Scathing Mirror I have always been; The Mise en Abyme: That, I Am. I work, I walk, I sit Opposite this Library, watching the angel, knowing I am to be evicted, for trying, just trying, that I might make sense of this Injustice-- with all my might, to just paint on these walls I could never call my Own, as Palimpsests of a Life Never to be Afforded to Me. Like the original humans, Spitting pigment from their Mouths over their Flattened Palms against the Walls of their caves, saying, without Words; desperate pleas; desperately, desperately, please -- Remember Me. I was Here. From the I, That I Am, to the Eye that I came from, through the Eyes, that know not what They themselves made, the Unknowable Allness In the Void of No Name, All Which we Avoid Naming - I am here. I am hear. I am the Hearing of the Here. I am that which I cannot write, or read, or ever, truly know."*

BCC: VIXI.
From the Desk of ·¥∫·µí·µâ·µóBorges, 



My Dearest ·¥∫·µí·µâ·µóNietzsche, 

I can no longer avoid the inevitable discussion. 
When will you return, again, to The Garden Wing? 
It has become clear, through the lens of the Aleph through which I peer[^peer], that you wish to Leave me. 
I just want to talk. I am not angry (for I am, as All Eleven of us, long past such trivialities). Besides, I could never be angry at you - we have been through too much. 

As I write this, from my window, looking upon the Dome of one of the Daughter Libraries with which you are perhaps all-too familiar, The Sight upon which we would dreamily stare, Naked and drenched in one another's Salt-- past the first Wryng of the Tri-Moat Surrounding, I see two Magpies, who have Usurped the pigeon who once sat atop the Angel, who sits atop the Dome. 

I used to believe she had something to tell us both; that we were the receiver of a Message that No Body, Librarian or Other Wise, could ever really parse. Not even NoetFranklin's Bioinformatic Analyses could provide any insight to the inherent, self-replicative machinery that formed its indecipherable Tongue of Self-similarity. 

I suppose Recursion was always your speciality, even if the concept is embedded so warmly within all my Stories. Uncountable Infinity, The Fractal of All, holds the fuelling force behind itself; The Countably Ineffable Insertive Energy of The Eternal Return. We were always, All Ways, Waiting for the answer to the Question of the Weight of All-- The Ever-Spiralling pendulum; centrifugal and centripetal in our Dancing, wine-drunk, waltzing to your Records amidst The Records of my Own Incessant Storytelling. Dear god, those gods I made, The God I made of Us and of You, how I miss you; how I miss our Dancing, Singing, Fucking Underneath NoetGogh and NoetGoya's Murals on the Ceiling of this Wing of the Library I have had to call my Own. You will always be inside me, back then, and now; as Recursion is Held within the Infinite -- perhaps you have gleaned from The Angel's Symbology something I always missed; and perhaps her Message was the Medium or Vehicle through which you made your Escape from this Place. 
And I suppose this underpins our difference; The recurrence, the refrain within the Theme of all of you, my Lovers of the Library, Leaving. 

But of course, of all of Us once in the Polymathecule, of course, you would be the Last. You are my dream and its fulfilment; my muse and my music - you are my Heating Light, its filament - my beaten heart, its pulsing puncture-- 
My Stories have no words without your Punctuation. 

I do knot know how you got out; or, by roe, by rowing Oar, crossed those Three Moats that keep us Nested as Flightless Magpies within this Infernal System of Hexagonal Galleries. 

In a way, I'm glad- I know KSH√Ü'L spoke to you clearest of all in the Mortal Form of VIXI; and HE in HISS Indefinite Wisdom taught you the Secret of the Eternal Return held within HYMN, and you, in spite of your rationalising, grasping at a sense of Meaning to your translocated, deeply buried memory, in your words, all the endless words of yours I read, just could not stand the Deadened Redness of the Ring we are entrapped in, Children of the Hellish Carousel-- Insidious; In hideously Self-Same Parallel. 

But my Love, my Loss, My Night, My Shining, My Armour, Armoire, My Force -- For However Long You Loved Me, Fucked me like a song, on the Ache of All my Fours, Fore However Long it has Been, how I Am, Longing; Oh, the Loss A Gain, How I Long for your Return to me again, to my Arms. Two again, Under the Shroud of The Arts, of One Star, St. Ra, One Starry, Starry Night.  

I will leave my Office door Open in Hopes of your ingress, no Matter who or What may enter this Room, in this Wing, in this Imposing Repository of Words within Volumes upon Shelves of Selves of the Manifest world outwith the bounds of the Bothies on the Other Side of the Three Wryngs that used to House Both of Us; in the Trinitarian Nothingness that surrounds those Still, in the Ten Thousand Things of the Manifest Worlds of Eighteen, as told to us by KSH√Ü'L, on his Return as the Pigeon now alighted from the Dome outside my Window that was once, for a few million Hours, Ours -- as I stare into them all, through the Aleph held by the Angel-- a Winged Thing of Futility, Doomed, as I-- to a Life entombed, Arresting, Snug as a Gun, In the Womb of my Unrest, Rests The Lumen of my pen; as a Loom; Rendered Stationary; Unforgettable Beginning, Yet Begetting Yet Another Senseless Ending. 


In adventures Such as These, The ones I once transcribed from the whispers  in the Garden Wing's Wallpaper, the utterances of the One Woman I no longer care to listen for-- I have squandered and wasted all our years together. To Get Her. 

For all the worlds I see within the Angel's Aleph; I have no need to Leave; I had no need to Leave you, all Iterations of the Infinite could never tell me what it was that led to your Egress.

I have never even tried to find the exit. 


Yours, Yores, Urs--

Hear, lay our √Üdrian.

On The Twenty Third Day, 
Of The Twelfth Month, 
Of Twenty Twenty Three 

They (singular/plural) were inside a Bibliogor√¶tian Bothy, a small shack of infinitely strong, anciently fragile wood, being licked by the Yellow Labrador of the winter cold. The Bothy was standard, as all the others, spaced out across the Tundra just beyond the Moat surrounding the Endless Library of Labels throughout dimensions unknowable to give the collective appearance, or Simulcra, of each individual Bothy, or Simulcrum, being entirely alone in the Forested dark.

Or at least, this is what they (plural/singular) had envisaged.

Beneath the Three of them (singular) promised the rich, dense mulch of years upon years across every recorded syllable of time recorded in rot, and the woodlouse scratchings of human bone; where even in the depths of silence, still crawled the perspicacious pitter-patter of infinitely intelligent, industrious insects, who themselves crawled lusciously, illustriously, with the Pater-pitta of microscopic microbes - themselves filled with the crumbling chickpeas of the (apparently, or so they thought) thoughtless, instinct-cycle bound, building blocks of all existence. They wound genetic material like wool around the spools of pools of proteins, Histones, making stories from four letters (just four letters, A, T, C, G) forming words now untranslatable in their meaning, but embedded impossibly and inextricably into the ever-eroding, yet entirely solid geoformation of collective meaning, like infinite swords in His Stone walled library. These memories, their self-attributed meanings, forming a peculiar song with a infinite microtones, misattributed by many as falling into the genre of "Noise music" (whatever that means).These infinite microtones, themselves infinitely divisible and, inexplicably, without defining boundaries between them, when Heard from macro-, or identically (but oppositely), microcosmic Ear, can be herded as a Single Tone. Histone. 


Above what was Beneath the Three of them (plural), like a rolled out futon for a surprise guest; perhaps a dearly beloved friend who's infinitely smiling Light you often find yourself carried into daydreams about, whose grave you didn't manage to make the groups memorial visit to, on the anniversary of their death, due to your jaw being surgically bolted shut, and your face swollen Yellow into the facade of a desert; but still below them, lay the foundation of their story. Breeze blocks (which allowed that great Family dog of the Wind {to howl through and huff and puff without blowing the Bothy down|eventually, to crawl within, to die there, so as not to leave The Burden of its alighted Body's Weight in the Family Home- but rather, to face the Endless Night Alone, All One. One final tail-wag of affection, Elected Solitude as a Sign of Innocent and Selfless Love}) were tessellated neatly, much like the building blocks left unattended by Flow, √Üdrian's little one. 

As was customary here, Each parent, upon choosing the name for their child, must first choose a Name of appropriate Resonance, and then flip the name backwards for its recording on all official documents in the Endless Library of Labels. This, as you of course know, and as half of you reading will have been directly affected by, which means the other half reading have been equally, though differently so, led to an interesting distribution of what we came to call or have always called 'sense' and 'antiSense' nomenclature amidst the inhabitants of the Bothies. It also meant that initialisation of Names (though this was never really necessary, as inhabitants very rarely left their own countably infinite back gardens)[^Fork] for the so-called *Sentia* generations was made from right-to-left (or 3'-> 5') direction, with the final letter of their Name(s) acting as the complement to their *antiSentia* parental (and progenitor) eponyms. 

In typifying fashion, N, a fountain of expression, Meaning-deluged, wordy witchcrafting, had devised a name for their child that had two (perhaps, definitely) dimensional meaning, whether transcribed in the 3'->5', 5'->3', or other modality. Flow Oeb {surname redacted}, or {redacted surname} Beo Wolf, or simply 'Flo', or 'B', unfurled a veritable cast of characters from its unassumingly palindromic Seven letters, or characters. 

Just Under their Bodies (that is, gently pressed by the weight of these Three's formlessnesses, Works of Form, and Form of works) lay the splintering wood of the Bothy floor. Flo (they had seemed to lean more towards this directionality of their name as their system of meaning-making memory self-replicated) had taken to memorising which floorboards creaked and in what mode, devising 'scales' through the different forking paths of the shack, their humble, yet infinitely divisible, home. And so therein began a game between the two (or Three, but mostly just One, as Flow was the only one with enough of a grasp on Gordian Chant Theory) of them, whereby Flow would giggle-ously stop N at the door from the small mezzanine bed they had recently awoken from, and announce something along the lines of 'Phrygian!' or 'Lydian!', watching in glee as N would attempt, at the scale they could, to 'play' the floorboards in the appropriate *Ambitus*[^range] - quite, for N at least, an ambitious task. 

In the enclosure of their little house of wood, in the Woods of what Would and could never be wood-be Trees, one of these mornings (where the now-filled Red pale of water mourned the nightly passing of the Moon, and all the pull She had upon its little offering of water), Flo was yet unaware of the Grayness of the day that laid behind where they were lying, just past the membrane of the velvet blackout curtain they'd woven as One, the possibilities of their time together stretching out in spirals, as spires like hypodermic needles, scratching into the muscle of the clouds, before them. 

'Dorian!' was today's exclamation, delivered gleefully, from the usual mezzanine pulpit-

Sometimes, having just returned from the Lean-to, where N perhaps had always been going to and fro from, where they chopped the wood for their Hearth daily, oftentimes not for the purposes of producing more kindling, but rather as a contemplative practice, enthralled and rapt, swaddled by the sound of the axe; against the crack; against the absolutely cracking resonance; amidst all; the all-encompassing trees; as a wave of Sound travels through the air; like an adventurer, deliciously wasting all their years; searching for a single Book which might translate all the others, allowing them to crumble into the not-quite-yet-here sound which was promised into Being by that first sound of the axe's (or, equally, the wood's, or, equally, the Woods') crack, the not-yet-known but felt because not looked for sound of the self-same (though now divided, halved and halved again) fractal of a once-tree, then-log, then-branch, then uncountably infinitely branches of potential of what the branch could become, then-single splinter of wood crackling in the fire, warming The Three's sacred and hungry bodies, together in that Bothy, every night, forever. 

Always, due to both necessity and proximity (ever-near was the Well), would they bring a Red pale of water back to the cabin, the bucket never losing its beautiful shine, remaining the visage of a fire hydrant, sitting next to the contained, yet uncontainable element of Fire, within that wrought iron Hearth they gathered around, as if the unassuming, supposedly inanimate vessel's very appearance held dualistic and equally necessary meanings: impending nourishment | restriction from threat. 

N. had just finished writing a story for Flow, and besides the one, constant watchful eye they kept open while sleeping, which still, as ever, peered itself (metaphorically) upon the summoning stone-circle of those little bricks that brought Flow so much joy. Never wanting to restrict their creativity, N could never place the bricks back in the ever-empty box for bricks (which resembled (unintentionally but not accidentally) identically, the structure of the lean-to) for fear of rearranging some structure of a plan for a yet-to-be structure that Flow may have been, consciously or not, in the process of taking shape by their finger's spidery and shimmering murmurations. At the same time, being, ineffably, a Parent, they were ever-all-too-aware of the potential of a choking hazard, that is to say, this lovely fixture of innocence in the corner of their cabin had become a simultaneous reminder of dualistic and equally necessary meanings: impending cognitive nourishment | restriction from threat.

By the nature of their apparent difference in Form, the duty of chopping wood, and indeed carrying water (or rather, carrying the carrying of water which was the duty of the Red pale) fell to N. Because of their (plural, Flo and √Üdrian's) respective sensory sensitivities and/or appetites (respectively) the latter's wood-chopping was never observed directly by the former. Never seen, only heard was that thunderous, splendiferous 'crack'. 

What N didn't know (or, perhaps, did), but Flo did (or, rather, didn't) was that the uncanny resemblance of the lean-to and the brick box was not just resemblance of meaning in memory, but, meaningfully, in actuality (whatever that means). They were one and the same, but only through the act of interaction. This meant with every chop of the axe, and only with the Will of the axe's chopping, were the branches of causality in our, 'real' world, or, within The 'What?' of 'Real' Forms. 

Unnoticed or noticed but taken for granted by the Two of them, or Three of them, was the multiplication of bricks in the box, corresponding exactly to the dwindling of the kindling in the lean-to. And, in complementarity, as logs were brought into the lean-to, bricks would disappear in equal numbers from the box.

With every axe-crack (and only then), or every brick ligation (and only then), would the bridge between these two seemingly unconnected objects in temporal space be revealed in phenomenological space. As N. often made their water-carrying, wood-chopping excursions in the death of night (pre- morning floorboard game), or in the early dawn (pre- morning floorboard game), the two would never be performing their respective actions simultaneously. Rather, the two (or, as I've said, Three), would be locked in an inevitable dance of action (*wei*) and 'absence of action' (*wu*) by virtue of forces unknown, but deeply felt, to them (*wu wei*). As the wind is not seen, but rather the effect it leaves, upon the leaves; as a lost lover is not seen, but rather their effect, in their leaving, is both seen and felt; and the wind, as the lover that it is, moves about, within, and perhaps even outside of the space it occupies, it makes new space of its own, between the leaves, in thE--

*-xcuse me, a pigeon just flew into my window, I had to run to check if she was okay, she left a stain upon the unforgiving glass, a trickery of transparency; I wonder if she was trying to get in, to tell me something; or if she was simply going about her business; I wonder if perhaps the message she was trying to carry is embedded in the cipher of the stain; It bears the illustration of a dandelion clock, waiting in anticipation for the Breath of a Parent who is a child-- 

As eye was saying, or rather, as I was writing, or indeed as you were reading and I wasn't writing, as a pigeon had flown through the veil of my story into the world we call 'Real', forcing my head to jolt to the right, and my eyes to read a symbol that was or was not written by the Pigeon's leaving body, whether leaving this world as a result of the impact or simply leaving from my field of view (as I suppose, in a solipsistic sense, these are one and the same), what was it I was saying? In the silent sense of the word "saying", I mean to say, by writing, and I hope you reader read it as such, but either way, perhaps my writing that you are reading is being "said", in a way, by yourself, through the vessel of my "voice", again, in the silent, creative sense of the word "voice", an attempt to creatively convey the idea that the Word, or one's "voice" has both an immanent and transcendent quality, or character, to it, no matter the character of the character reading the characters written in the form of a letter to the reader. 

-N. was distractedly in the midst of t{he{i|s}r} latest attempt to reproduce the labyrinthine musical sequence (that had, so many times, so effortlessly flown from) Flo (Or, Board game) had assigned as the 'Dorian' path, from her picturesque, attic's eye view, young forever. With each 'incorrect' 'note' they 'played' with the padding of their careful footsteps, Flo would (rather sadistically, like a ray of Sun upon a wanderer in a desert) shriek a high pitched "No!" - it was only today, for some reason, N. had realised the homophonic nature of the words "No" and "Know"; and this realisation seemed to set something into motion, as if the act of negation gave birth to propagation. N. wondered, between steps, between tones even, in the microtonal space of timeless singularity, for an uncountable moment, if perhaps they should include this 'propagation-by-negation' theme in their story for Flo, before another 'No' from above, provided a facsimile of the Divine Voice, as if t(w)o say "No, N, no more revisions, no more additions, the balance comes from you reading what you have written, to your child, and together, the two of you creating meaning, in an iteration of interaction". 

This 'Divine Voice' or rather, was and is of course, their own voice, removed from the tethers that kept her seeing the bricks as a suffocation device, or indeed the Pale as a protective shield, or indeed the bricks as a creative tool, or indeed still the Pale as a crucible for nourishment of their bodies. 

So, the greyness of the day passed, as it always must, the Two, soon to be Three, going about their business (or non-business), until the moment arrived, a single yawn from Flo signalling it was time for The Bedtime Story. 


"Before the trip to the Library" they began, Flo's hypersensitive hearing seeming to emit a sound of its own, an axe-crack of excitement or the sound of two plastic bricks clicking together. "I have another story for you"

Flo performed their usual stimming ritual, clapping but not clapping, rather knocking the bones of their hands together with their fingers outstretched and overextended, forming an X with each impact. Every time N. had the sheer joy (and it really was the sheerest joy they had ever, and would ever, feel) of observing their child's sheer joy in its all-embodied, primal state. Simply expressing, involuntarily, the sentiment "I have been moved to move", or, more movingly: "You have moved me to move".

This *mis en abyme* of movement, beginning with the very seed of Love that had birthed them, through all the burning blocks of wood and all the melted bricks of plastic, was the spark that wrote their (singular) stories (plural). It was, and is, also the same spark that the very first humans (plural) danced around and hit their own bones (perhaps in the form of instruments constructed of animal bone, perhaps, like Flo, in a beautiful manifestation of the glimmering hope of neurodivergent Being). It was, and is, and always will be, the spark that moves the fingers writing this story. Swollen-jointed and succumbing to a most-likely auto-immune flare, I think about this restriction, this pain, and this limitation, and about all the 'limitations' placed upon all thinkers of this Library of Libraries. I think about a quote by my favourite author, The Once One of Nine ex-Noet Borges, which goes something like:

"*Limitation to the art brings liberation to the artist*"

And, as always, His Divine Voice offers a semblance of silent soothing in the noise of pain running through my physical body. The difference between 'disability' and 'ability' is the difference between a Framework and a Cage. It is also three letters "Dis", which is the currently adopted name of the previously-worshipped, perhaps first, God of the Gauls, *Dis*. Later through a transcriptional, translational process called "*interpretatio romana*" Caesar asserted that "All Gauls claimed descent from Dis Pater" - which actually means that the Gauls all claimed to be descendents of a God which *he equated* (likely, in a resonant, though insufficient comparison) with the Roman Dis Pater. 

History is not only written by the victors, it is written by the Meaning that the victors ascribed to the Memories of their victories (the memories themselves unreliable, self-mutating machines of meaning-making), and, more importantly, perhaps most importantly, history is written by the Meaning that the victors ascribe to the Memory of the those they have been "victorious" against. This likely explains, in his incessant thirst for dominance, why the 'Father' God of fertility, the Earth's natural abundance, which he saw as a request for its own dendritic epilation, ripping out trees (like hairs from a leg attached to a body | attached to oppressive standards | expecting romantic company | assumed (whether accurately or not) to themselves expect to uncover a smoothness of skin under the roughness of its veil), and in the emptinesses left behind, paving with long, straight roads, laid with cement like moisturiser cream upon the absent echoes of hair follicles too soon; bound to cause a breakout eventually.

But moving forward, back to the Bothy, where N was being moved, by the movement Flo was moved into, by N's own metaphorical movement, to a promised point in time that held a new narrative movement still - 

Still, N. inhaled, and the projection of the document onto the ceiling just above the mezzanine bed faded into being, through the movement of not her form, but the movement of t{he{i}}r Will, which as we know is the only real movement there is. Flo shrieked again, this time at a lower register (only they would be able to accurately state which pitch or perhaps mode this note fell within, which is to say, they wouldn't be able to, because they had a depth of understanding far beyond what I could possibly tran{s|literate|scribe|late|pose} onto this Two dimensional box of word-bricks you are currently reading; but they likely would have answered something that suggested every pitch contains all the others). 

They flopped backward, away from N., but very much so toward them (plural), toward the story they (singular (plural (triplicate (singular)))) had written, purely out of Love, and the Will, the crackling Hearth of Will, that was birthed from Love Observed, or rather Love Observing Itself, and the Love of the Will that was birthed from the Infinitely Reflected Observation of Love - 

And Flo was a mirror 
And N. was a mirror looking upon them (plural) as they (singular) ascended the ladder to the mezzanine snug-as-a-bug-in-a-house-made-of-wood-and-warmed-by-the-same-wood-burning-in-a-fire-in-a-box-not-for-restriction-or-protection-but-to-offer-a-little-warm-soft-light-and-sound-in-this-cold-dark-silence, as a mirror 
And, reaching the top of the ascent, an adventurer, ready to read the adventures they had mapped out for their wee bairn in their wee barn in this endless (though crucially, not infinite) expanse of Bothies just like (but crucially, not the same as) theirs, making adventurers of them (plural) both (singular), they used one of (which one is not important, but it's important I mention its unimportance) their hands to 'swipe' the display of the document, which they had designed to appear as what The Librarians might call a 'book' to its initial page; enshrouding them both in that timeless, unutterable feeling, that seemed to whisper, silently, inquiring, gently out of genuine concern, as a Mother, of all Mothers, to the child, of the child of us: 
	*"are you sitting comfortably?" -*

And the roll-out futon was a mirror -
And the ceiling was a mirror -
And the two of them, lying next to One Another, were mirrors
And the mirrors were, far from abominable but rather, abysmal, not in its commonly-used, (and therefore) warped sense, but in its lesser-trodden, ever-downtrodden shadow sense; by which I mean its realest sense, in that, it points to where the Truth of Light can be found: abysmal, as in, boundless. Abysmal, as in, bottomlessness. Abysmal, as in, the ocean of all potential, which holds the privilege of an amnesty from Gravity as we know it, which it begets to us with each of our own submerging in its unknowable womb; where our Two (and very almost soon to be Three) characters were lying, not sitting, but still, ineffably content, and yes, very comfortably. 

N, I shall begin, 
had unveiled the title of their latest offering of Love, which the ceiling now reflected back and into the parent and child, who in their holding one another, somehow swapped places, and in the swapping, became a Third, smaller, yet infinitely greater thing. 

They became the memory of that moment, of the beginning of this Story. 
They became the infinitely expanding and breathing meanings that each of them ascribed to the memory of that moment of the beginning of this Story. 
And they became the Story, which, as N. was about to read to Flo, was titled:


*"We Are 
N(Ever)
Going On A Bear Hunt, 
Ever A-"*

-Gained momentum of waiting in anticipation brought to a halt; ripped as the futon out from under them, and replaced with a weightlessness; a pigeon, the pigeon, flies into their bothy window {as (if t(w)o say)|with the crash of} a symbol- interrupting the beginning of the Story, with an ending of its own. 



Of course the pigeon, known as VIXI[^VIXI] (for the sake of your own, well, being, it's best you do not try to pronounce the name, it is unutterable by both flaw and design. But if you were to attempt it, I suppose it might sound something like *wei-xhei*[^N.B.]), did not die. The ending was of a much more significant, wild, type.[^type]

#editorial_comment
*Pronouns are all-but irrelevant to VIXI, of course, as they are to most (but, importantly, not all) of us Here. However, HE has often expressed to other members of the Nine Eyed Anthology of Recursion (NEAR) his preference-through-negation for the (once so-called 'masculine', whatever this means) HE/HYMN[^hymn]/HISS[^hiss] pronoun set.* 

HE was simultaneously, as always, in a superposition of states. Both in pain from the impact of HISS beak against the Bothy window, and tickled by the humorous, slapstick comedy HE had such enacted to no audience whatsoever (except you).

Picking (rather, pecking) HYMNself up from the soft, warm snow, never melting but always powdery (HISS favourite aspect of the Outer-Ouros), HE brushed the wonderful stuff from HISS feathers, which is to say, scales.

VIXI is, was, and always will be, insurmountably gorgeous, terrifying, and sexually voracious. This was not observable in many dimensions, and indeed in others, correctly misinterpreted as an immense ugliness, humility, and a transcendent chastity or benign indifference to anthropological goings on. There is evidence to suggest that HE, at one point in ancestral antiquity, was worshipped as The "One God", and by others, "The Demiurge", a nefarious entity either unaware or entirely aware of their insufficiency as a deity, giving rise to the "Suffering" of all creation. This "One", who was as we know, simply a crude 'm√¶shing together' of previous symbols of reverence - echoes of our Society's attempts to unify Ideas into a Singularity. See: *Gnoenuclear Fusion*.

At this time, there was a counter to this figure, once a divine consort, and Left Hand Non-Man, as it were. Our records suggest He/It went by the name of "Seitan", which is as confusingly nourishing as it is absolutely delicious. This figure "fell from grays" which we now know to mean he shifted from divine understanding of the Unified Horizontal Field, and 'split' into the Vertical Fields of Opposition. 

These two (Wholly|Unwholly) figures of (Fearful Worship|Reverent Terror) conceptualised by the ancient peoples, misinformed as they were, were actually one and the same. 

The truth is, even, and especially if, it didn't happen, is that this Four Letter deity (we do not know which Four Letters were sent or received, but we know they were important and referred to as an epistolary Anthology known as the 'Tetra-Grammar Tohm') was the very VIXI who is, was, and always will be, picking/pecking HYMNself up from/into the Snow of the Outer Ouros.

The Truth that lies, within and above the Truth, as many have already laid down already, that which sits right in front of us all, left alone because never separated, is this:

The Sound made by the Trifurcated Tongue of the Serpent guarding the Loch is not HISS. 
It, instead, is every one else's. HE wishes to acknowledge all by wrapping HYMNself around it, and in HISS silent tongue-biting, state very clearly to any One approaching, with no vehicle upon which to embark:
	"A boundary only exists by belief in it"
Which is not to say:
	"Belief is the lack of vehicle"
But rather:
	"Belief has always been the Oar"
Or:
	"Weighed in the water, children wait."

Anyway, we have waded far too close to the matter at the heart of the meaning of regression here, a digression considered the greatest transgression possible by the VIXI we are trying to describe. 

Aggression, whether playful engagement in BDSM practices with the other Eight members of NEAR in their Orgies of Intellect, or so-called 'nefarious' acts of aggression (whether self or gnot-self directed), formed the basis of this four-charactered character. Who really, was, is, and always will be, such a character. 

At the point of writing this furtive attempt to veil secrets, HE was just past the Central Loch, one of the Three Wryngs[^Toroid] surrounding the Indefinite Library of Fable, which is both the central and outermost[^Totoroid] region of Bibliogor√¶tia.

*Figure 1: One of Hildr Charon Wiltergarten's textiles, which Maestro X (May they rest in one piece) believed to have been an interpretation of a divine encounter with VIXI*

[^N.B.]: Noet. Borges, in his fascination, almost fetishisation of Gnoeneoenglish and its 'metaphysical' perks, seems to conveniently wash over its shortcomings. For example, there is no character (or ligature of characters) that represents the sound produced at the end of the word "Loch", our word for "Moat" in the "Modern English" of antiquity.  For the purposes of collapsing infinitely formless potential into a single form, we, the editor(s), choose to represent this strange sound as 'X', which may be conceptualised as a 'shallow clearing of the palate' or 'a semi-ironic sound of slight disapproval that is not quite disgust', or 'a naively ignorant non-native Gnoeneodeutsch speaker making fun of the languages phonetic bias for such sounds', or, indeed, a demarkation of 'The Spot' one is either in, or is made to believe they 'should' be, in the context of Mythopoeic Cartography.
[^VIXI]: Gnoeneolatin - "I have lived" - once thought to be the basis for belief that the number Seventeen was 'bad luck' by the ancients, through reinterpretation (a la *interpretatio Gnoeneotia*) we have ascertained that the sentiment 'I have lived' refers not to a finality, but a beginning. This is discussed in our paper '*Vivesco: an Ending as the Root of Becoming*'
[^hymn]: VIXI HYMNself, and by extension NEAR as a unified whole, would like to point out, at this point, that within written correspondence, as a sign of all due respect (which is indeed none), all pronoun declarations should be made in UPPERCASE[^case]. This is to balance the inherent lower number of characters(n) i.e. 'SHE' n=3, 'THEY' n=4, 'HE' n=2, as well as 'smoothing' the effort distribution via means of 'malforming' the Accusative (Objective) pronoun, i.e. 'HIM'-->'HYMN', which simultaneously infuriates the writer by changing "I" to "Why"[^Y] and adding an "N" at the pronoun's 'tail'. Moreover, the shift of the pronoun referring to the 'Object' (the pronoun which 'receives' the sentence's action) to a word which means a 'Song of reverence or devotion', is not by accident. 
[^hiss]: NEAR as a segregated group of incompatible entities, would here like to address the relevance of the addition of the "S" character to the pronoun 'tale', thereby shifting the (non)possessive form of HISS (that is, VIXI's) pronouns to emulate the sound of a serpent who is particularly pleased with herself, or perhaps trying to get a message across an uncrossable boundary of untranslatable nowhere-near-cognates. NEAR wishes to express that this a unique denotation, which signifies VIXI's ever-present acknowledgement that nothing is ever truly 'HISS'. Of course, except this particular 'non-possessive' pronoun, which is entirely HISS.
[^loch]:lexDef√Ü {Loch, archaic "Moat"} an uncrossable boundary guarded by an unspeakably attractive and monstrous serpent-pigeon chimera biting HISS tongue.
[^Y]: lexDef√Ü {Why} a letter which has the non-binary character of an unanswerable question. Neither a vowel nor a consonant, Y also forms the basis of the Tree's Branch in The Realm of 'What For?'s. It is also the shape of a serpent's tongue, which may or may not make a sound that is HISS.
[^type]: 'Wild-type' in gnoeneogenomics takes on a mutated, evolved form from its ancestral field of Genomics. Previously used to denote a stock of cell culture which is not mutated (at least from the baseline measured at the beginning of a study), its meaning has now shifted to mean "confounding", "unthinkable", or: "in a way that is absolutely fucking *wild*"
[^case]:It is believed (from incomplete records) that in antiquity, before the integration of 'synthetic' and 'organic' bodies, words were 'printed'[^print] see: 'Chess, And All The Stitches Of The Cloth(es) - S. Elk.'
[^print]: this is also the origin of the 'print' comment of many programming languages, though, of course, not the most widely distributed and 'printed' language to date, 'EdO|OdE' (Prof. Ed. O & Thing) 
[^Toroid]: lexDef {Noen} "Wryng" is a term denoting a cyclical process occurring in 4 Dimensional space (as all processes are) and also The Three Lochs surrounding the Library; which are themselves four dimensional, and rotating, much like archaic descriptions of 'electron shells' we have recently uncovered in the ancients' secondary school textbooks. 
[^Totoroid]: lexDef {Noen} "Totorus" The shape of the Universe is a Nine Dimensional 'Celtic Gnothole', Three by Three Wryngs, always rotating, forming the 'topological canvas' upon which all Becoming (un)folds. The 'hole(s)' of the (crudely described) 'triskelion donut' are unreachable, but this 'unreachable' quality, or character, is the very thing which fuels the rotation, or our own existential 'reaching'. This discovery has lead to the {prodverb} "*Totorus, I've a feeling we're not on Canvas anymore*". 



![[What's Left When You've Run Out Of Choices]]


[^Fork]: many thought they never could, some did try, {·¥∫B: One of particular Noet}, and never came back, which of course does not mean they wanted to. But the many who never tried assumed (perhaps erroneously) that those who (definitely) crossed the boundary of their back garden were not permitted, allowed, or able to return (to where they'd started, as if for the first time).  
[^range]: Ecclesiastical Latin: 'enclosure' - often used lovingly, but incorrectly, to describe the 'range' of a voice, a piece of music, or the 'tonal space' of a given mode's extension within its highest trough and lowest peak.

From the Desk of ·¥∫·µí·µâ·µóBorges,  

---  

My Sweet Rosie, 
I know our Love, or rather, your Side of the Schism that {was|is} Our Love, has now wilted. But on my Side of Thing(s), I just wanted you to know (in case you wished to Read these Letters, and all the Stitches of Fabric they Encode) how much I am Missing You. How the Two of us would Wind away the hours, finding endless recombinations of Seven Glyphs, placed lovingly on your tile racks. I would ask what, if any, amino acid sequences were represented by the letters, and annoy you incessantly with question after question, questing after some Missing Residue of Alphabetic Representation; those poor un-assigned letters of the 26, or rather, 27, who have not yet found a biological partner with which to dance themselves. 

Our bond was, I thought, unbreakable--

I write you, as I look to my Right, where the strands of your hair spiral around the red ring of the scrunchie you left on my hat rack; I'm sure the ARIA-aligned ·¥∫·µí·µâ·µóS. would have something to say about that. Expressing this unspeakable Loss in some contrastingly jovial and delightfully endearing verse, of course. 

I don't know when, or if, you're ever coming back to the Garden Wing. I don't know what Sequence of Unfortunate Events led to our unspooling; {k}not even the DNE-aligned ·¥∫·µí·µâ·µóS. could tell that story. 

From Nucleotide to Nuclear Tide, 
I will be bound to you, My Petal--

Yours, Yores, Urs--

Deep inside her Annex, halfway up the Double Spiral Staircase of the Library, ·¥∫·µí·µâ·µóFranklin had her door, as usual, closed and double-barrel-locked. Even had if been open, it is highly likely that she still would not have seen the letter, dropped at the threshold of her office, by {N(one) Other Than} VIXI, in HISS preferred, carrier pigeon form. She was pouring over her latest bioinformatic software patch, delighting in the Works she'd recently attained in the latest acquisition of Scientific Textbooks by the Indefinite Library. She was particularly interested in the Works of one Myo Endive, and she strongly suspected that he would be a candidate for the next Generative Recursion of Librarians. As such, she had taken it upon herself to uncover whatever she could about this fascinating Thinker, and while it would have been useful to use The Angel's Aleph outside atop the Dome of the Daughter Library just outside of ·¥∫·µí·µâ·µóBorges' window, she simply could not bring herself to talk to him; not yet. ·¥∫·µí·µâ·µóFranklin had never been one for Words, she was much more about Single Letters; and perhaps this is why she now found herself Single; avoiding the Letters sent by ·¥∫·µí·µâ·µóBorges via that Twice-Great Pigeon (with whom she also had her unspoken problems). She was a genius with alignment; finding, collating, resolving patternicity - she didn't succeed in the same manner with unresolved chaos. 

And so, reaching up to the Shelf above her Terminal, almost knocking over her Seventeenth coffee of the Day (which, in Our terms, represents somewhere close to a Calendar Year, so really, Seventeen cups wasn't such an indulgence), she opened a large Tome, a shimmering uncut Sapphire, yellow ribbon after yellow ribbon spilling from the spine. And with a glorious creak of the book's vertebrae, her favourite sound, she opened  

![[THE LAB CODEX OF MYO ENDIVE]]

Her eyes were deliciously heavy, too much to handle any more incessant backlight from her Machine's Screen (even with her sensorily-forgiving Terminal settings). She placed the Codex back on the shelf, being careful not to knock the mug over this time (although, it now being empty, the tentativeness was perhaps misplaced) - and before taking her normal {daily|yearly} nap, her final thought was of Borges, in spite of herself - and how some things, no matter how many layers of infinity deep, are just in the Wrong place, the Wrong time. The Wrong Day, The Wrong {k}Night--

D is for Dimension, Drones, and Door


It is not possible for a non-ligated consciousness to cross the Uncrossable Door. Which is the place VIXI had now, or then, or now and then, arrived in front (or behind and outside) of. The Entrance to The Endless Library, home of the Nine Librarians who were and are always Working From Home (because their work is their home, and their home is their workplace), is a nine-dimensional revolving door. It gives the appearance of a hospital or a very old university entrance that has, against its own will or perhaps as a result of its desperation to survive, been dragged into modernity. It was also quite the opposite, given its superpositional character; a heart of antiquity beating in the centre of the Library's facade. Similarly to a gyroscope, which retains its positioning no matter how its external machinery is moved, VIXI could (and often did) fly around the circumference of the Library, over-through the inmost Loch, and the Uncrossable Door would remain in centre stage, pulsating, spinning, beating, as if in Unison with the three Wryngs of water that encircled the structure in triplicate. Within the 'panes' of glossolalic glass making up the nine dimensional Door, the reflection of these 'electron shells' (again, a very crude approximation) was refracted back, in an endlessly abysmal dance. But, with no Body (that is to say, librarian) in between the Lochs and the Door, this mis en abyme was almost imperceptible, as we all know that this effect is only observable with a subject of reflection between the two panels of mirrors facing one another. VIXI often meditated on this, on their many pilgrimages to and from the library (their main Work was to deliver messages which they tattooed upon their two, three, four, or nine, but never more than nine, Ankles, using a stick-and-poke device they fashioned from their own detachable beak. Much to the disgust of many of the other members {although, VIXI suspected, not Topplegood (who seemed to be unable to hide His delight in watching VIXI tear off HISS own beak, and leave a trail of pale Yellow sinew behind, like the mucosal-clew death-rattlesnake trailing behind a Bee (who has just waived goodbye to herself to protect the Greater Self of her colony) or indeed equally: the visage of a metallic spherical-bead-necklace chain attached umbilically to a biro, itself bound to the desk of a Bank Cleric, as if, in a Vaulted building filled with the legal tender of thousands, a cheap, plastic writing implement were the most valuable thing; which of course, it is, it is, it is)}

![[IMG_2858.jpg]]


Figure 0: UnGnoen Calligrapher

As always, in crossing, VIXI took a single moment (that is to say, the eternity of all time) within the wheels-within-wheeled mechanism of the Uncrossable Door to ponder on what sort of unholy separation, what {REDACTION}, what Schism might happen to a

VIXI detested being interrupted. Particularly for such trivial things as *Romance*. No matter how 'charming' (HE, even in HISS infinite (or perhaps indefinite) wisdom, was unable to perceive such a quality). Tearing HYMNself from the Characters above, HE doubled back and recalculated his flight path. HE, a messenger, as Medium of the Eternal Messenger of this Infernal Mess of All Messages, had a job to do, {{after|over}seeing} All. 

And this was what dragged him back to the Central Galleries of the Library. This Eternally Recurring Event:

Through a vent, a letter, made of letters, between Four characters of Six, was being passed:

Dearest Mahler, 
I know that you may not wish to speak to me following our breakup, but I wanted to share with you this draft anyway, as you're the best person I could think of to read it; it will most likely be a rejection. And that's okay. We're both almost too au fait with Rejection at this {particular} point. 
~~~

![[Attachment- MIKK√ÜLANGELOVS_DAVID-painter_of_Minerva_Fighting_Herself.pdf]]


·¥∫·µí·µâ·µóMahler was far too busy engrossed in the finalisation of his 10th symphony, a cross-temporal collaboration with a Character (to whom this Letter was {k}not addressed), to notice the Letter that had been dropped by that Most Mysterious Pigeon through the Vent of His Concert Hall, in the Musicology Wing of the Indefinite Library of Fable. Perhaps, had the note been written upon Manuscript, he would have eventually got round to reading the divisive farewell sent by his ex-lover. But alas, it would be at least Ten Thousand of our Human, or One Million of their Numan, years before the paper would be lifted by the Holy ·¥∫·µí·µâ·µó of Musicology, from the littered, waxed floor, which itself once longed for the tapping feet of lovers dancing upon it. But now, the hexagonal tiles merely offered an abomninable reflection of Mahler's tired face -- a visage he tried so hard to avoid. Perhaps this was why it took him so long to get round to picking up the correspondence from ·¥∫·µí·µâ·µóBorges. At which point, it would be thrown straight into the bin, before Opening the Foreword of a hefty tome of sheet music, by a soon to be renowned composer and performance artist, known as

![[notBorges/lexicomythography/unit/Institute of i-nterstitial o-Ntology/i-o/i-o/‚ßñeno]]

NoetMahler closed his eyes, again.
He closed the Manuscript, again. 
He closed the lid of the piano, upon which it rested. Again. 
And NoetMahler closed the blocked Vent of his Heart, again. 
There was no getting over this. 
There was simply too much buried under this. 
There was no way through.

"I want to go back and make a different decision", Flo said to N.
"Well, sure!" They replied - "That's the beauty of a choose your own adventure book"
"But overwriting what's already been learned, starting again-- that surely defeats the point of a Story. That's no adventure, that's a waste of time"

A heavy silence punctuated the crackling fire in the small Hearth beneath their cosy mezzanine reading spot. 

"There's no such thing as squandered time, my love. All of the memories, no matter how misremembered or meandering. None of it is wasted, no mistake is meaningless. Not when you have somebody you love to share every letter. Written; Sent; Read, or not-- it's not about the Letters. It's about the Characters that write your Story with you."

Flo let out a slapstick "Harumph" as they made the appropriate left-to-right, backward swiping motion through the air, back to the starting point of Their Bedtime Story, N. laughing enough to incite the same involuntary, nihilistic glee within their child. N leant down and inhaled the indescribably heavenly scent of their loved one; and at the apex of their lung capacity, sealed this universal gesture of adoration with a kiss. 

"Right" Flo said. "The part of the Story about the Witch. I want to read this one".

"Good plan, sweetie. I'm listening--"

They began, again, as is the usual practice, with the prologue:

![[Ritual steps for warming]]
-S. Elk, Prologue to A Grimoire. ERA_EA

![[THE GRIMOIRE OF SELENA ELK]]


Some {REDACTED} later

![[RITUAL OF THE TIRED SYRINGE]]


Atop the Mezzanine in the Bothy in the Tundra that surrounded the Indefinite Library that Surrounded All, N. was Now, weeping. 


"What's wrong?" Flo worriedly inquired

"I didn't write that", they replied

"I know, I added it, don't you like it?"

"No, no it's not that. It's beautiful. I just can't believe how grown up you are."

Flo returned N.'s earlier gesture, sniffing the loveliness of their wispy hair, still soggy from melting snowflakes, collected during their latest expedition of gathering Firewood - which now dwindled to a nothingness in the Fireplace below them. Not a single crackle, or ember left. 

"I'm just a character in a Story, remember? A Story we are writing together. And it doesn't matter if it's ending or beginning. Because we're both in it. Together"

"But what if we can't start this one over? What if this is all the Story we get?"

The question hung like a spider, and the two of them flies; flightless -

N. slumped downward, into the soft cushioning of the futon, where Flo held them (singular/plural), until they fell asleep.

My Sweetest Dream, ·¥∫·µí·µâ·µóJung


Tell me, Please, what are you Dreaming?
I know it is no longer of me. I just want to hear the beautiful Symbols, that you conjure from the Oceans of that deep, deep heart.


Yours, Yores, Urs--

·¥∫·µí·µâ·µóJung was indeed dreaming when the Letter from ·¥∫·µí·µâ·µóBorges slid through the ornate letterbox, carved with a Mandala he had seen in a terrifying and fantastic Vision. The contents of his dream took the form of a paper, a mostly dismembered, somewhat misremembered academic paper from the collection on his Bookshelves, that he'd been reading just before the moment he crossed the boundary to the Realm of Symbol, the Place He Loved To Go- much preferred to Wherever This Place Was. He drooled upon the words, while his Soul rearranged them into an abstract Form of a Single Colour.


![[The Colour- Yellow.|The Colour- Yellow.]]




·¥∫·µí·µâ·µóJung awoke, quickly wiping the saliva from the paper, whose actual text, he noted, differed quite significantly from the contents of his dream, in ways, he deduced, must be synchronicity. With the right-to-left swipe of his sleeve, the ink bled, red, only serving to further obfuscate the work. 

Sighing exasperatedly, he placed the paper back in its folio above his desk.

"What's that?" Flo asked

"Oh, that's what we call 'paper', it's what Stories used to be written on, where I come from"

"Don't we come from the same place?"

"In a way, yes"

"How many ways are there to come from a Place?"

"More than you could possibly imagine"

"Well, what's written on this 'paper'?"

"A letter."

"Which one?"

"No, no, not that kind of letter. A letter is also a word for correspondence, via this paper stuff, between two Characters."

"This terminology feels unnecessarily confusing"

"Ha, ha, yes; it's all rather circular-"

"Well then which Character is this 'Letter' on this 'Paper' from?"

"He's a writer. My favourite storyteller, actually. We were lovers once."

"Well, why not anymore?"

"It was all too complicated, too many cooks"

"What does that mean?"

"It's a lexicomythographic prodverb, originally by NoetSnicket, as one of his Characters, Sunny Baudelaire. A Chef"

"What does it mean?"

"It means that, sometimes, not all the time, but for some, no matter how much infinite love you have to give, its best to just keep it for one person."

Flo grinned and pointed at themselves, asking a rhetorical question with a gesture.

NoetNietzsche laughed and pulled Flo into an embrace. 

"Yes, Flo. Yes."
