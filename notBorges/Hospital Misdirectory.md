##### [[Patient Welcome Pack]]

Dear Patient,
We’re going on a bear hunt. We’re going to catch a big one. What a beautiful day. We’re {k}not scared.

Upon arrival, you will be confined to your room. 
There is a one-way system of vents. 


##### Re: creation

No music is permitted within the walls of the Hospital.
Correspondence with your fellow patients may be made through a single scroll of Wallpaper. All notes must fall silent. You are {k}not alone.
The note can’t go under it. The note can’t go over it. 
The note can only go through the one-way system of vents. 
Tiptoe! Tiptoe! You are {k}not alone.


##### Facilities

Swishy swashy. We will guide you through the deep, dark cave of your own unravelling, but we will not remove your chains. These chains are metaphorical, but they are just as non-fictional as the Doctors on Staff for your own betterment.


##### Getting A Round

Firearms are permitted for use only by the Staff. They are fitted with silencers to ensure your Safe Departure Into Quietude. Cadaver Chutes are installed through the centre of each spiral staircase; which you will never see, even, and especially if, your lifeless body should ultimately make its way through its lumen. 
Stumble trip. Do not think about _The Woman in the Wallpaper_, who may or may not be in the central room. She is fictional. She is more real than any other patient in the surrounding rooms.
  You are {k}not alone.
You are {k}not alone. You are {k}not alone.

##### Help has Left at Hand 

You will {k}not be visited personally by any medical staff, but please, rest assured, you will be observed at all times. This is for your safety only. You are {k}not alone! What a beautiful day. The removal of your identity is for your safety. We're {k}not scared. Do not ask what your name is, you will receive no answers. Questions are permitted and encouraged, but we gently suggest the redaction of punctuation such as the Question Mark, in order to save writing space upon the scroll. All of your belongings will be taken from you in order to keep you safe. You are {k}not alone.

##### Visiting \<{H}ours>

are {k}not yours. But you may be visited at any given time. 


##### Mourning Mindfulness


You will awaken not knowing your name. There will be a single object in your room. It will guide you.

Please find a wayfinding map of your place of residence for the next Era.

We wish you a restorative stay; for you to rest, for the rest of your pitiful little life.
