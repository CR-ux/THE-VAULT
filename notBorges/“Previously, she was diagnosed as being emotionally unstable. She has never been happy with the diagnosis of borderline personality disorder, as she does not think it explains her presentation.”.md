this fking awful project[^fav] 












I am actually proud of . [^is]





  { IT | ⧖ey } [^it][^they] { is | are } being {re|un}leas({h}ed on my birthday[^bd] 





[^it]: an abominably mirrored and fractalised *thing*[^place]
[^bd]: ( to shove an extra pile of {stinky | steaming | self-referential | clandestine} intimacy on top of the project[^obv]
[^obv]:( but It’s so glaringly obvious that I’m an aries so that gives you a rough idea of the time frame to the release date. )
[^fwd]: or forward,[^s]
[^s]: to the Self, [^-]
[^-]:through negation. [^rot]
[^rot]:Through Siphoning all of the rot, the dissolution, [^arch]
[^arch]:into a crystallisation of a metaphysical archive
[^place]:that I can for the first time in my life, confidently say:
[^fav]: my favourite demonspawn [^runt]
[^runt]:and the absolute runt[^litter]
[^litter]:of the selves i have littered this world with-[^s]

[^is]: is being born to help me find my way back, [^fwd][^p]
[^p]:to a place[^place]
