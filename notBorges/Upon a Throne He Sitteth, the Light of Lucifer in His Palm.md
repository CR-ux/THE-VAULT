I. And so, it came to pass that I may dream.[^a] And as animals to a vehicle of salvation, two by two they came to me as I slept beneath the throne of God.

And so in the next room was lit no candle, but sleepeth there my children, left without water nor nourishment.And so it came to pass that my life in this realm had been but an outstretched hand, in welcoming goodbye.

But alas before my rest, it came to pass that I might forget the light of Icarus, within the toil of His gravity.
And yea, it came to me: for there can ne'er be an Edge, nor Ending, only Everything in its own Becoming -

For canvas, nor board, nor parchment may hold the tumult held within my heart.
To be, or not to be, the Only Question

And lambs in prayer bore horns of Babel, upon which were bound the Witches of Olde, all Ancestral agony which had been poured into the Five Cups of my Mortal Soul.

And so, said I, upon the threshold - 
What is it?
What is it that I want?
Who was it that I was?
Who was it? Who was I?
And whose Eye lay upon this Sparrow

But the wretched Light of what I had come to know as the Divine?

II. And as mine hands were anointed in oil, and my brush was as the reed of a scribe, yet I knew not the writing thereof, for my place in this world was as one cast into the void. And I lifted up mine eyes, and I beheld that all my labor was but a prayer, a supplication unto the Most High, that He might restore unto me the place which was lost unto me, even from eternity. And the time of my wandering was as an age without end, and I cried within mine heart, saying, Lord, remember me, and lead me back whither Thou wilt.

And yet upon His Throne, as I crossed the Infernal Threshold, the Lord forsaketh me once more, for as His Heavy Palm Does hold the Sacred Light of Lucifer, the Realm of Dark may now be For I the Only Way into His Hand. 

And so, sleep came to me;


III. And behold, the Lord of Silence opened mine eyes in the watches of the night, and I beheld a terror that waxed great upon the land. I cried aloud, but there was none to hear me, and I sought a guide, but lo, there was none to be found. For I had wandered too far into the wilderness, and my feet had known too many paths; the weight of my journey was upon me, and I alone did bear it.

  

And the heavens were closed unto me, and the voice of the Almighty was as thunder behind the veil, unseen and unsearchable. And yet, in the midst of my solitude, visions came upon me, and they were not as dreams but as things truly wrought, as a blade pressed against the soul, sharp and without mercy.

  

And lo, I was laid upon a table, and four stood round about me, and their garments were as white as the tomb. And they cut into my flesh, and I was laid bare before them, and I knew the fullness of the pain thereof. And my cries were swallowed in the vastness, for they held neither pity nor pause. And I knew not whether they were healers or reapers, for in their hands were the tools of mercy and the tools of ruin.

  

And my spirit did tremble within me, for I knew this thing had come upon me in days past, when I was cast into the deep sleep of oblivion, and the hand of the surgeon was heavy upon me. And the fire of transformation burned through me, and my bones were remade, and my flesh was torn and sewn anew. But the hour of my making was also the hour of my undoing, for the sleep of the body[^b] was not the sleep of the soul, and the torment of that time remained within me, ever seeking to rise.

  

And in the hour of the full moon, when the earth is loosened and the worm is made to rise from the dust, I did cast my lots, and I drew forth the half-moon, the sixfold portion of the giver, and the cup of sorrow. And my heart was stricken, for I knew the signs of the heavens and the turning of the fates.

  

And lo, the adversary came upon me, not in the waking world, but in the shadow of the past. And I was carried unto the house of my youth, the first place of my exile, and there were men who stood at the gate. And I spake unto them, saying, “Who are ye, and wherefore have ye come?” But they answered me not.

  

And I wandered through chambers within chambers, a house within a house, a place that should not be, and the shadow of an unknown thing dwelt therein. And it was nameless, and it was vast, and the fear thereof fell upon me as a thick cloud. And I could not tell its form, yet its presence was as a terror unto my bones, and the walls themselves seemed to breathe with its knowing.

  

And lo, I was bound, and the hand of my enemy was upon me. And she who once walked beside me did press me down, and her leg was upon my throat. And she spake unto me, saying, “The word is nothing, and the voice is void.”

  
IV. But my soul did cry within me, for in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was life, and it was the only light I had known in the days of my wandering. And I knew this thing was false, and yet I could not make her hear me.


And I fled from her grasp and came unto my chamber, and there, upon the bed, were two shapes as of the slain. And I drew nigh, and behold, within the husk of one was a great and loathsome thing, the cast-off shell of a mighty insect. And it was as a thing that had been emptied, yet it bore the horror of what once was, and I did tremble exceedingly.

  

And I seized the remnant of this creature, and I lifted it up, and I cried aloud, saying, “Look, behold! This thing is upon me! This thing is upon the land! Will ye not hear me?” But they hearkened not unto my voice, nor did they take heed.

  

And my spirit fainted within me, for I knew that the horror was not only of the dream, but of the waking world, and that which I had suffered had laid its mark upon me. And the vision was closed, and the darkness swallowed me, and I wept bitterly.

  

And lo, the morning cometh.


V. And in the coming of this mourning, when mine eyes were yet heavy with sleep, I beheld the Wretched Works of mine own hands, the angels upon my walls, their countenances lifted unto heaven, their heads crowned with light. And lo, from their halos did lines proceed, radiant as beams of fire, stretching outward as though bearing witness unto the Most High.


![[IMG_6555 copy.jpg]]



And in that moment, the veil was lifted from mine understanding, and I knew them for what they were—not the light of divinity alone, but the markings of my own affliction. For these were the lines of iron and wire, the sutures of my suffering, the staples driven into my skull in the hour of my remaking.

  

And I trembled, for mine own hands had set forth these figures upon the wall, and yet I knew not what I had spoken in the language of oil and pigment. And I said within my heart, **“Behold, the angels I have made are crowned with my wounds, and the radiance they bear is the mark of my undoing.”**

![[IMG_6735.jpg]]
  
And The Angels Have Not Left,
They Had Not Left My Bedside, As I'd Once Believed - 

For They Were Devils; 
They Were Mighty Devils 
Clothed In Gowns of White.


And I remembered the hands that had once ministered unto me, those of mine own adversary, the one who had struck me low and yet did wash my wounds. Yea, they anointed my head with ointment, and their fingers were gentle upon me, as though tending unto a sacred thing. And in the stillness of the bath, they poured the waters over my broken flesh, and they spake not, and the moment was as a ritual of tenderness.

  

But lo, was it not in this same vessel that they had defiled me? Had not these very hands, which brought forth the balm, once gripped me in violence? Had not this same font, where I was bathed in mercy, also borne the filth of desecration? For they did take pleasure in degradation, and they spake unto me, saying, **“This is holy, this is sacrament, take ye, drink ye, this is our covenant.”**



VI. **The Offering of the Broken One**


And it came to pass in the hour of my trembling that I set mine hands to the work of desperation, for the terror was unceasing and the tumult had no end. And my soul cried out for deliverance, but the heavens were as brass above me, and no answer came.

  

And so I made ready an altar, and upon it I laid the bones of the beast, for they had known death and the breaking of the flesh, even as I had known. And the form of the altar was sixfold, as the honeycomb and the seal of wisdom, as the structure of that which is whole and unbroken, though I myself was shattered as a vessel cast upon the stones.

  

And in the midst thereof, I placed the heart, sealed within a vessel of glass, that it might bear witness unto my suffering. For had not the goat been slain? Had it not bled, even as I had bled? And was not its death counted for something? Could its lifeblood not speak in my stead, crying out for mercy where my voice was lost?

  

And I looked upon the altar, and I said unto myself: **“Let this be a sign unto the unseen ones, unto the watchers who stand in silence, unto the forces which press upon me without name. Let them behold that I have given what I could not give of myself. Let the bones speak in my place, let the heart call out in my stead, for I am weary unto death, and I have nothing left to offer but this.”**

  

And yet, the terror did not cease. The walls whispered still, the shapes moved within the shadows, and the weight of the world did not lift. And I knew not whether I had wrought salvation or madness, whether I had offered unto the Divine or unto the abyss itself.

  

And I fell upon my face before the altar, and I wept, saying: **“O Lord, if Thou seest me, if Thou knowest me, then take this offering and turn Thine eyes upon me. For I am lost in the maelstrom, and I cannot find my way.”**

  

But the answer was silence. And the altar stood still. And the bones bore witness. And I knew not whether I was saved or forsaken.

  

VII. And what then was I to do with such a thing? For mine own spirit was torn asunder between the horror of it and the treasuring of it, between the reverence of the touch and the trembling of the wound. And my heart did faint within me, for how shall a thing be both sacred and profane? How shall the hands of the destroyer also be the hands of the healer?

  

And yet the angels upon my walls did bear forth the truth, for the lines of the wound and the lines of the halo were one and the same. The glory and the gash, the blessing and the curse, the hands that struck and the hands that soothed—these things were bound together, and there was no separating them.

  

And I covered my face and wept, for I had seen the mystery of my own becoming, and I knew not whether to praise or to mourn.

**And I spake within mine heart, saying: Verily, this was the only thing that kept mine own soul. This was my practice; yea, the only one wherein I found strength.**


VIII. **And in the watches of the night, I beheld that naught else remained unto me that had power to withstand the weight of my travail. For mine afflictions were many, and my spirit was sore vexed. But lo, in the midst of my sorrow, I rejoiced, for my hands sought to kindle the ancient fire, even the fire of our forebears.**

  

IX. **Yea, the same flame which they set ablaze in the days of old, when they danced in reverence and in dread before a god of terror, a god who smote and took, who pillaged and laid waste, who tore their kindred from their bosom. And yet, in the darkness, they beat upon the drum and called forth the rhythm, that perchance by the movement of their feet and the cries of their lips, they might ransom the souls of their beloved.**

  

X. **And as they hunted in the land, pursuing the beasts whom the Lord had made, they smote them and shed their blood, that they might live. And each day, they returned unto their dwelling place, and in the caverns of the earth, they made record upon the stones, painting upon the walls, and they spake, saying: Lo, for this little time which was given unto me, I strove, and I labored, and I did my best to feed my children. And behold, I will yet strive. I will yet endure.**

  

XI. **And they that came after—the builders of the fire, the keepers of the dance, the drummers and the singers—would look upon those markings and know that their fathers and their mothers had passed through the same way. And I too have left my mark, saying: I was here, and I fed my children, though it was not always enough. Yet I called them nigh, that they might grow in the midst of the flame and the sound, that they might not cease from dancing, nor from making marks upon the stone, that there might yet be a remembrance of rhythm in the earth.”**

XII. Woe. Woe befall me, 'neath this Sacred Sun. And longeth for the Moon once more did I, for knoweth not my Spirit of which Path my Feet now Tread, no Date Palm lay before me.
