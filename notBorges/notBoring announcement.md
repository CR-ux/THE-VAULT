ABSTRACT

<sup><sub>Æ</sub></sup>
{ notBoring | Boring } announcement

Dear cherished theydies and the gentlebent i have a special announcement 
of a forthcoming special announcement 
nested within a really stupid and not special announcement 
shrouded by an announcement hidden in plain sight 
to cover up a  harrowing {REDACTED} never to be ushered

  
2/9
<sup><sub>i|o</sub></sup>
For my next trick:


 my creative moniker will be transforming into ⧖er final form

  



  3/9
<sup><sub>U</sub></sup>
On my birthday in 2025, 
sincerely, absolutely, possibly, 
the best work I have ever made (which obviously isn’t saying a huge big lot, 
rather it means ‘the most grotesque and demonic fucked up piece of unhinged shit 
I’ve ever had the genuinely harrowing experience and subsequent impulse, 
no, parasitic compulsion, to make’),
is set {poised | hackles raised | mandibles quivering}
 to be released 


under a new moniker that will notB named .
⧖eir forthcoming creative output is essentially the alchemical Alembic 
where all the sporadic and disorganised work of my other projects is distilled 
in a {truly | maddeningly } arduous and mathematical process of encrypted curation. 

  

4/9

this is because this moniker doesn’t want to be known, 
and the work ⧖ey make has proved itself to be steganographic in nature,
in a transmedia cipher ⧖ey have developed.
 the keys for which are scattered across the internet somewhere in various forms. 
 ===
there are also three  in the physical world; 
doomed never to be found 
or their purpose understood,
	 which are hidden in the grounds of a psychiatric hospital ( in london)

I refer to the creative entity in third person because
⧖ey do not feel like  what I have come to call ‘me’
in any way whatsoever. Quite frankly, ⧖ey terrify me in myriad ways .

⧖ey are the result of the worst trauma and the most
intensely dangerous period of psychosis I have experienced,
{ cumulatively | recently- }

coming to terms with psychosis/schizotypal traits has been 
very difficult and nearly impossible 
because the nature of these presentations
means the recognition of their emergence 
can often be as elusive as the recall of a dream 


i also, at odds with my usual repulsive oversharing, 
*have been very reluctant to share information that may paint me as an unreliable narrator of my own story.* 
this is vitally important. having words, sentiments, experiences BELIEVED and *listened to* 
this is a vital , precious resource. especially for survivors 
especially for trans people. 
especially for trans survivors.
especially for trans survivors who wish to make art that speaks their truth; 
albeit a truth hidden away in form, 
to make form part of the art itself - 

the work we make with what love we have left for this strange life we've been gifted with; 
is the blemished skin that tells the secrets the heart cannot 




⧖ey are the way I am rebuilding; not my self. My life. 
My life itself as the artist; notMy life as an artist ;

finding my way back, or forward, to the Self, through negation. 
Through Siphoning all of the rot, the dissolution, 
into a crystallisation of a metaphysical archive
that I can for the first time in my life, confidently say,
I am actually proud of .

<sup><sub>charm</sub></sup>

 It is being released on my birthday 

(to shove an extra pile of stinky steaming self-referential clandestine intimacy on top of the project,

but It’s so glaringly obvious that I’m an aries so that gives you a rough idea of the time frame to the release date. )



8/9
<sup><sub>N</sub></sup>

anyway TLDR[^TLDR] i, but notI, am releasing what I consider to be my _real_ debut album on my birthday 

it is a triple album at the very least and i doubt i'll make anything i feel more satisfied with,
it's horrible. 



9/9
<sub>NB:</sub>


whether anyone finds it or hears it or not doesn't really matter, 
what's important is that i feel i've finally done it, 
that it's going to be  out (or in) there somewhere, 
and maybe i can rest knowing that , 
start to move on 
as a mirror 

[^TLDR]: yes i realise TLDRs at the end of a multi-slide album release announcement disguised as an academic paper are inherently against their purposes of function
