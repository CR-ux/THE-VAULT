coming to terms with psychosis/schizotypal traits has been [^un]
very difficult and nearly impossible[^bc] 

but my time in hospital allowed the worst of the dormancy to unveil itself[^rear]



basically forming connections between every word and sonic component of words
in this endless spiral of the most harrowing game of word / thoughtformn / resonance association


but now i am back i have reached a point where these traits

have become a balm, rather than a scary descent 

and so this next, culminating phase of my creative work is primarily literary in nature
(still with a heavy sound/performance component)

  


this is vitally important. having words, sentiments, experiences BELIEVED and *listened to* 
this is a vital , precious resource. especially for survivors 
especially for trans people. 
especially for trans survivors.
especially for trans survivors who wish to make art that speaks their truth; 
albeit a truth hidden away in form, 
to make form part of the art itself - 
  

[^bc]: because the nature of these presentations[^m]
[^m]:means the recognition of their emergence [^d]
[^d]:can oftentimes be as elusive[^f]  
[^f]:as the recall[^r]
[^r]:of a dream 
[^med]: they plural. the medical clergy, that is[^d]
[^un]: i *have been very reluctant to share information that may paint me as an unreliable narrator of my own story.* [^bc][^other]
[^other]:with regard to {myself | others}
[^rear]: and reared its head as a very severe hypergraphia & what they[^med] call {'clanging' | 'chain association' | 'delusion of reference' | 'magical thinking'}
