So the woman in the wallpaper is the author of the book of my epistolary account in my time in Psychiatric Hospital, which obviously had a giant chessboard in the garden, which is where I spent most of my time making sculptures from it. I also discovered on my last day, a vent coming from my room that looked like a hexagram for descent or something, or mountain. I can't really remember which number it was, but it doesn't really matter. The point is that all of these things led to the conceptualisation of the story, which is why it immediately surrounds, the six pieces immediately surround, and then the outside 12 is the album that came from that, and then the 18 outside of that is the 18 narrative universes, or individual universes of each character, as emanations from these central archetypes, who themselves branch from a singular central source, duality giving way to trinity to give rise to Six central figures, or Chess Pieces, or sides of a Di. These Six themselves branching into the Eighteen via another process of Dualistic Schism (each of the twelve dividing into two factions); and then the letters they send between them are symbolised, in the "Realm of 'What For?'"s, as Vents in the walls between this interconnected system of Chambers, the organisation of which represents the necessity and burden of Hierarchy for a system composed of self-same components to remain self-generative and animate. So you can see how it expands outward from this central red ring parallel, this book I wrote in the middle, and actually that's like the central text that's going to be maybe encoded with a cipher that's contained in all the other stories.
