-S. Endive, M. Endive, ERA_Æ




{REDACTED} Fighting Mars (Combat de Mars contre Minerve) is an oil-on-canvas painting once thought to be created in 1771 by who was thought to be the French artist Jacques-Louis David.



Interpretation of “{REDACTED} Fighting Herself”

The painting {REDACTED} Fighting Mars by Jacques-Louis David brings forth themes of du{redacted}thin the characters Noam and Nima, manifesting as opposing but interconnected writing styles in this novel.

Mars and {REDACTED}: Forces of Duality

Mars represents a left-brain, masculine archetype—a raw, strategic, aggressive force grounded in direct acti{redacted}nded receptivity, reflecting an internalised power that remains poised even in opposition. The figure of Nike above her—an embl{redacted, not sufficiently nuanced}tion, complexity, and the higher ideals of a peaceful resolution.

In this novel, Noam and Nima appear as analogues to Mars and {REDACTED}. Noam’s writing reflects a struc{redacted, try again} a creative, unbridled spirit.

Symbolic Objects: Conflict and Resolution Through the Elements

Each character’s surroundings and objects become potent symbols:

	•	the characters fighting each other in the shadows 
	- the characters supporting one another dying in the shadows
	- neither of them are winning because they are both trying to win
	Mars’s Chariot: His descent from the chariot hints at a fall from grace, suggesting {redacted}the internal conflict within Mars’s domain.
	•	{REDACTED}’s Shield: {REDACTED}’s shield, poised as if deflecting an unseen force, reflects her defensive wisdom. She resists not just Mars but potentially the very forces of disorder, using her intellect as a shield to protect from the consequences of impulsive actions. Perhaps guarding herself too much from the wisdom behind her.
	•	The Lion Knocker with the Ring: Between them, the lion with the ring could symbolise {redacted}of integration, a convergence of Mars’s strategy and {REDACTED}’s insight.

Emanations of {redacted}[^VIXI] Through Postures and Attire

Mars and {REDACTED} stand as avatars of {redacted} duality:

	•	Mars’s Exposed Chest and {REDACTED}’s Covered Chest: Mars’s vulnerability, portrayed through his exposed chest, symbolises an unguarded nature,{redacted}und may represent sacrifice and transformation, signaling that only through enduring the trials of duality can true wisdom emerge.{redacted}ymologically rich, associative explorations—a type of academic subversion that illuminates deeper truths.

In their narrative journey, Mars and {REDACTED}’s interplay can reflect the growth of these characters {redacted, neither of them are winning because they are both trying to win}

The Painting as an Encounter in the Story

In sum, {REDACTED} Fighting Mars becomes a fulcrum of The Audience's narrative, {neither of them are winning because they are both trying to win}

2. **The Androgynous Crone as True Sovereign**: Appearing feminine yet bearing a moustache, the Crone characterises a synthesis of gendered archetypes, embodying sovereignty that transcends the dualistic tension between Mars and {REDACTED}. The Crone’s shroud, threaded loosely yet powerfully through the scepter’s top, signifies a veiled yet potent authority that{neither of them are winning because they are both trying to win}

4. **The Hand of Death as Silent Guidance**: Death’s hand, with its definitive yet gentle indication towards Mars, symbolises the inevitable embrace of cyclical change.
