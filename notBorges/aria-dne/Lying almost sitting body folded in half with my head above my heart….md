falling through wheels in wheels of despair and guilt and self-flagellation then clawing up towards resolution and understanding of privilege then allergic resistance to the word itself and thinking about my own oppressors and abusers on a personal and structural and global level then back down into comparison and absolutism and no other human mirror through which to reflect and contextualise but the actual mirrors placed on my walls too harrowing to peer into and the swelling and the deep stitches in my gums and the hinges of my jaw and the screws embedded into my chin and the exposed nerve of the tooth now crumbled thanks to my disability and the lack of integrity of my connective tissue it brings and the starving and the blaming that I’ve subjected the sanctity of my aging body to the avoiding of the life I have been given in reluctance and the subsequent inability of the bones of my jaw to keep my teeth intact and absolutely none of it even a small mark or smudge on the disintegration of this planet and the disintegration and obliteration of Palestinian bodies and black and brown bodies and trans bodies all around this world being pulverised by a darkness more all encompassing and senseless than any darkness I may have ever felt on a personal level and wondering why I have not been able to connect to the gratitude and joy and privilege of my own transition before realising there is no joy or euphoria any of us can feel in our singular hearts that isn’t shrouded and polluted and muddied by the collective loss back of everything no wonder I cannot rest or sleep my brain conjuring convulsive images of bonesaws and sounds of tissue ripping and snapping like twigs underfoot and feeling at once so alone at this time and unable to be amongst love or gather community meaningfully barely feeling the sunlight slowly starting to creep through these double glazed windows no interest in parties or practice or anything I thought could bring connection when disconnection is food now isolation is food now I devour it loaf after loaf and it leaves me hungrier for justice mind simply emptied by pharmaceutical plasters placed upon this burst pipe of my spirit once so light filled and defiant and living authentically now only a shadow cast by the artificial neon of headlines and jolting breathless from sleep paralysis to a handful of text messages and an alarm I’d set for some reason I forgot (perhaps to remind me I am alive in lieu of being Love) and no blame anymore nothing or nobody to blame just back to the breath through a nose blocked and crusted with blood and a wishing for will just a wishing for will anything get better will anything conjure a will to be strong enough to heal and use any of this pain for something other than silly little songs and another night spent alone is nothing to the days and years and centuries and millennia of loneliness held in the hearts of us all yet felt directly with such immediacy by those under rubble and pulling babies out of wreckages of rebar and concrete and earth and dry, dry, earth falling down and no food and no water and the world carries on carrying none of this weight I cannot lift caring about interest rates and swiping right and scrolling scrolling the dead see scrolling fingers swollen and another party and another sedimentary layer of sickly disgusting and stark hierarchy and another birthday and turning thirty and still clutching onto a teddy bear a heavy boulder rolled away the milestone of miles and miles of a journey having learned nothing and needing someone being laughable and selfish and absolutely pitiful and in survival barely living and not thriving is the never ending knowing that at the senseless hands of ignorance that put me in this specific form of agony there are people dying there are people dying there are people dying there are people dying and what are we doing but sitting here tears falling over swollen cheeks onto a smartphone opening a journal app and writing
