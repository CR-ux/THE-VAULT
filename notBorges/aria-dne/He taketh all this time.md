He taketh all this time 
Give endless hefty blows
For the sake 
Of making your immortal 
garment 

Do not mistake 
The stillness of my tongue 
For silence 
Do not mistake 
My lack of words 
For Silence 

Solitude be
The greatest romance 
Solitude, the
Communion 
 
I arose
In need of a vehicle 
I awoke 
Beset with the need to flee 

Pestilence enters the chamber 
The rock rolls away from my skull 
thoughts swarm and plague my restless heart 
Hark! The angels have all left my bedside 

I hold onto Him 
Like my motherâ€™s sleeve 
Before the hellish gate 
weeping for transfiguration
