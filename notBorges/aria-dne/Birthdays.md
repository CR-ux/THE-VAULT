Birthdays, those first days 
They’re the worst days 

Buttons of shirts as the
Bookmarks of pages 
Retell regretting in that simple minuet 
Known and heard by both of 
Those who made it and those 
Who never showed up
To that sweat drenched 
Unforgettable turn of the 
Weals in wheels in reeling over 
Yet another year 
Gone 
But not 

For
Getting every thing I thought 
I wanted I thought 
I wanted I 
Wasn’t thinking anything when I made you Callie 


Happy birthday 
The sentiment 
contains a demand 
The sentiment knocks down the door
And begs, unrequested 
Demands, 
By missed chance and 
Drowned romance and 
Kissing, 
Dancing- 

The sentiment shakes 
the stage, the chest 
Quiver of impossible 
arrow 

The sentiment takes place 
Of age, the rest - 
River of uncrossable 
narrow 

The sacrament makes waste 
Of page, the nest 
Shiver of this incorrigible 
marrow 

The sentiment breaks waves 
Burnt sage, a test- 
Liver of this living 
Thin, 
Sorry, little 
Flutter-falling 
Heartbeaten, rising 
Waving 
Goodbye to yet another 
Year of trying to
Fly 

In some sort of unwarbling 
Path, 
I am done with my branches 
I am sick and splintered with them all 

I have been ripping at my roots 
And nailing them to trunks 
And fingers numb I drive the hammer 
Missing, missing you or 
Something of myself I thought I’d found in 
Hollows that I left in you or 
Something of a song I thought I’d
Laid down as a lover 
Rapt and wrapped and raptured into 


A sentiment 
Demanding not a word 
Except 
consent 


I think they made my thirtieth birthday the worst day of my life 


And just this morning 
When I’d pulled myself out 
Of the lake of what you’re pouring into me 

You asked when my next one would be 
Two months from this timeless fog now blanketing our morning eyes 

And we laughed as 
Children as we 
Are 

Realising my thirty first 
As every other one, from one to 
That one 
That hurt - 

And dirty, warmed and wet 
stuck to the back parts of you 
(Where I’ve been trying not gather leaves)- 

We peeled apart like segments of a fruit 
With the same satisfying Velcro sound 

A warm that came from you reminded me 
I am savouring this moment, you, just leaving 

I am savouring the letting go 
Of the ideas that find themselves 
Knot-rotting and sand-sinking ink blot sloughed and 
suffocating all the air  

I am savouring my newfound disarmament 
In the uncertainty of your 
Arms or what you 
Bear or have 
Bore, 

Auger to Augur 
Water to water 
The Lion laying down right 
Next 
To the 
Ram 

And lying, left there I
Couldn’t stand 
The sanctity I’d never planned to 
Gather in your hand and 


Finding myself lost in why our names might rhyme 
(thrice sufficing for my insight into your reply): 

It’s a dangerous road 
This one you’re 
thinking yourself along 

 more dangerous still is how I’ve lost interest in this poetry either because I am thinking about you too much or because I want to be thinking about you more  
Or im thinking about what it all might mean and how terrifying it is 
And how every birthday comes around with yet 
Another web of intricate and searing meanings 
I have contorted my lost year around 


I don’t want this not to mean anything 

I hate all the ways my words might be read 
And how none of them are the same as the sentiment 

That just 
Keeps coming back 
To 

This morning we found out I have the same birthday as your mother
