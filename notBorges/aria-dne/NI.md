*The First Chapter Penned by Pawn* 


> *"and there were times when it felt like we were architecting chapels to the gods of harm;*
> *when we would invent structures of veiled abuse, entrenching our entropy in our entrails;*

Half-dead, I still do not know how long I, we, spent in there
Or how many of us there were, by the end 
Or if any of us were the same people as when we arrived 

It's possible that I was the only one left, from the original Six--
Or even, perhaps - and this is my most horrifying thought, an incessant fly's buzz, at the cracked window of my skull:
I may not be the Self who arrived in that Room, between Seven and Eight O'Clock. 

All, a board 
We were told, 
Not by Word, but by circumstance, that time stood still in the Hospital 
Which some call the Hivehouse

The time in every room, contiguous, sucked out like a thorn-
the clocks paralysed upon co-ordinates
The time in each room is out of time, 
instead, together, 
unthinkably together, they form a map.
I cannot forgive them 
For they once knew what they were about to do 

I still do not know my name 

But the things I do know, places all the other pieces in a Stalemate, one I am too weak and too afraid to draw their attention to. 
Besides, it's too late now; 
I'll never write letters to, or read letters from the other Five again. 

People are enthralled by stories of Cults because we as a species are ever looking, half-listening, barely there but hunting - for a higher power. We see an individual, or group of individuals devote themselves to something and, as they disembowel themselves, tear each other apart, blinded by an obsession stronger than love - and, whether we are ready or able to admit it, we envy them. 

We envy them until we make a god of our own. the gods we make, we make them so that they may smite us; and then our hours are blissfully filled with lament. 

For there is no hell deeper, colder, than an answered question;
Than a hunger sated, or a teaching integrated- 
There is nothing we fear more, 
Than the imminence of safety; 

It is danger that keeps us half-alive
