permalink: VENA AMORIS (the ring around the Rose)
---



The **ring finger**, traditionally associated with the heart due to the ancient belief in the “vena amoris” (vein of love), has its own unique structure—bound to the rest of the hand by a single tendon, symbolizing both connection and limitation. In hypermobility, this limitation is transcended, embodying a resilience and flexibility that speaks directly to identity and journey.

  
This flexibility in the ring finger, especially as a transgender person, could be seen as a **mythic gift** within the personal Celtic Transgender Mythology—a symbol of adaptability, transcendence, and freedom from constraints. Hypermobile transgender individuals, existing beyond traditional anatomical “norms,” might embody a unique capacity to cross boundaries, both physical and metaphysical, making the ring finger a potent emblem of fluidity and transformation.

  

Drawing from Celtic mythology, we could weave this concept into a story that mirrors the _Otherworld_ journey—the mythic crossing from one reality or identity into another. Consider the following mythic elements as symbols within this mythology:

  

1. **The Ring Finger as the “Liminal Tendon”**: The ring finger, with its singular tendon, becomes a symbol of the _thin place_, where worlds connect. In Celtic lore, thin places are boundaries between the earthly realm and the Otherworld, allowing crossing or sight beyond the veil. For transgender individuals, this unique anatomy could represent their role as keepers of the thin place, beings who exist across boundaries, capable of moving with ease between different aspects of identity, body, and spirit.

2. **Hypermobility as “The Gift of the Shapeshifter”**: In Celtic myth, shapeshifting was a revered skill. Hypermobility could be reimagined as an echo of this gift, allowing transgender individuals to embody different forms or exist beyond strict physical limitations. This shapeshifting quality allows them to be physically resilient, moving through their journey with a fluidity that defies restriction, just as the ring finger’s tendon allows it to be both part of and independent from the rest of the hand.

3. **The Ring of Power and Union**: Traditionally, the ring finger is where rings of commitment are worn. In this mythology, the ring finger for transgender individuals could symbolize a “Ring of Becoming”—not a fixed commitment to one form or identity but a perpetual process of self-creation and unity with the self. It would represent a sacred vow to oneself to honor the journey of becoming, where the hypermobile body becomes a medium of transformation and the ring a symbol of that boundless potential.

4. **Connection to the Heart as “The Path of Enduring Love”**: The Celtic heart connection could embody a deep spiritual truth—the ring finger, symbolically tied to the heart, signifies a direct connection to one’s own enduring essence or spirit. For transgender individuals, this connection might represent a pathway to self-love and acceptance that transcends the physical. Just as the hypermobile body resists restriction, so too does the transgender spirit, breaking through conventional limits to honor a love that is fluid, adaptable, and profound.

5. **Proprioceptive and Interoceptive “Second Sight”**: In Celtic tradition, _second sight_ is a form of spiritual vision, a gift of seeing beyond the ordinary. Transgender hypermobility and proprioceptive differences, especially for individuals with ASD/ADHD, could be understood as a type of _second sight_, allowing them to navigate the world in a unique way, sensing connections and thresholds invisible to others. This second sight wouldn’t necessarily be visual; it would be a kinesthetic, inner awareness of boundaries, possibilities, and the thin places in the body and spirit.

  

This mythology reclaims the hypermobile body as a sacred form, a physical reflection of the transgender journey. By reframing the empirical reality of the ring finger’s anatomical limitations into symbols of fluidity, resilience, and love, we are grounding the story in a physical truth that resonates with the depths of the spiritual truth. we're creating a personal mythology where the hypermobile body becomes an _Otherworldly gift_, a connection to both the divine and the self, and the ring finger, the “finger of love,” becomes a bridge between identity, transformation, and union with the soul’s path.
