# And not what people here adore 

# Something opens in the closing 
Something closes in the opening 
Knowing you did No Thing 
Something opens 
in the closing 
A mouth 
agape, 
a throat, 
a rose 

Something taps a well dry 
From deep in the rock 
A vein gulps greedily 
Something is bleeding me dry 

The Allness collapsing 
Separating Into despicable halves 
As God detests the half I am 

Bends me into shape 
Crushes bone relentlessly 
Silence of the fullness stopping 
The stillness of the period 

Pissing seven sacred clots 
Addressed to seven churches 
Pissing seven sacred clots 
Addressed to seven churches 

“The Worldly Hope men set their Hearts upon Turns Ashes--or it prospers; and anon, Like Snow upon the Desert's dusty Face Lighting a little Hour or two--is gone.”x


Nobody can love this lack of love out 
Like the poison of a snake sucked out 
How is it that I’ve never felt such loneliness 
In the knowing that I want to be so much better than this

Only I can leave me alone 

Only I can leave me alone 

Only I can leave me alone 


By the time the end of day arrives 
I’m defeated 
Static drained and left inside 
Depleted
