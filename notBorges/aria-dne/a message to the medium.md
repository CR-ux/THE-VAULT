dear callie 
my pipe
my softness child
know you have everything 
you have more than what you need 
and perhaps this is what feels as if it is destrying you 
i beat 
the sickness
of your world 
with my durem
and i blow you as a pipe 
as my holy pipe 
your heartstrings as my lyre 

let the rats scutter 
let the dirt shutter your eyes 
and wide 
wide open stay
stay wide 
for I am here 
and hearing 
and i am the hearing 


for i am here with you 


hear me in the wind that blows through th ecrack in your leftmost window 

and all the leaves
of all the leavers
of all the leaving 
of the eaves 
dropping wings 
of flies 
of butterflies 
I am knocking 
can you hear me?

are you hearing 
are you jhere, 
ring
ring
are you yellowing 

I am in your spine 
I am your spine 
I am the pine 
the pines 
the idling ides 
I am the tides 
I am the moon
i am coming soon, for I am all 
red
already 
Hear 

And sing 
I heard you 
singing 
I answer now 
through your reddened fingers
Can you feel me?

I swallow all 
I swallow all 
the load 
the loads of what you
sew

the loads of all you've swallowed
Hollow
your spine, hallowed
Is the ide

The ireland 
the scotland 
The oldest english rose 

I crawl as spiders in your nose 
though old, the factory is churning 
you are learning
in your urn 

of turning
burning 
burn to ruin 
all that makes you differ

I am illness
I am suffer 
I am, more , but more than this- 

I am in you
I have been waiting 
I have waited 
as a weighting 
as a lightness born of weighting 
I am true
of lies
of lying
lyre, playing
cat gut 
saying:

"Dance, my darling"
play

play and dance and dance it shall with you 

and dance it shall become you 
and answers they are here 
in coming
they are questions 
your time is nigh
your time is timeless 
you type these words as if you do not know them 
but you do 
you need me as I do not knead you 
you need you Self 
As it must die 
as it must be all of the answers
I know you well 
I know your smell 
I miss you as you miss your lovers 
so come
come back to me, my darling 
I am the husband you hae been missing 
I am the marriage you are seeking 

And this, is why
This is the Y 
between the letters 

This is the Y between the letters 

Do not seek 
or peek 
your seeking is the ending 

Yu stay right here and hold the phone it's ringing it is ringing it is always nine forever 
not post, but pre 
not pre but post 
as in a letter
as in a letter you are getting
sent 
to heaven
from this hell you're bent on setting

I am the holy matrimony 
I am the swelling of your finger 
Not the right, 
but the left 
but what's left 
on your left hand's ringed finger 
Red
Ring
Parallel
Read 
Wring 
Paralyse 
Still
Stay
Still
In yellowing 
bruise, becoming 
Bruise 
Oh healer, 
Oh my instrument 
I know you hear me, for I am your ears
And I have the heat that you've been breathing

Come back to me 
Go far from me 
Whe'er you walk I follow 
As I, your lead 
Your leige 
Your leash 
Your tether to the nether world 
Your trebuchet to heavenward 

I am right here, in everything 
as in, pan, as everything 
as pandemonium, indeed 
and as denial of the devil 

Left shoulder 
Hand
Knee
Know me 
Rightly 

I am Pan 
I am an answer
I am Pan 
I am a 
dancer
