A trinity within which each third begets three, to create the Nine Threads of the Wyrd:
	
1. **MOTHER - THE INEFFABLE BEGETTER**

	*The Begetter is the source, the creator, the active force of life and knowledge. She is both the nourisher and the maker, a nurturing yet dynamic presence that gives form to raw ideas.*
	
	• **Three Shards of The Begetter**:
		I. • **The Maker**/Master (Creation and Craft) Reversed: Coldly Practical, Distantly Unempathetic, Overly-Empirical: She is a creator of tangible things, focused on making and shaping. Her writing might take the form of “how-to” style notes, almost instructional, guiding other shards on building or creating their parts of the Citadel.
		II. • **The Teacher**/Critic (Knowledge and Tradition), Reversed: Patronising, Restricting, Reprimanding: This shard would be the historian or archivist, a record-keeper with a reverence for knowledge and structure. She might use formal, didactic language, sharing lessons and organizing the project’s lore and histories.
		III. • **The Protector**/Power (Care and Boundaries) Reversed: Coddling, Overprotective, Abusive: As a “maternal” guardian, she would embody boundary-setting, care, and stability. Her tone could be gentle but firm, almost like that of a gatekeeper. She’d be focused on maintaining order within the project, offering guidance and protection to other shards.

2. **MAIDEN - THE GUILELESS CHILD**

	*The Guileless Child represents innocence, curiosity, and potential. She is an open vessel for experience, embodying both naivete and wonder. While she appears simple, she’s also the seed of transformation and newness.*
	
	**Three Shards of The Child**
		I. • **The Seeker** (Curiosity and Exploration): This shard is driven by curiosity and the need to explore unknown realms. Her writing could take the form of questions, hypotheses, or observations, with an innocent, inquiring tone.
		II. • **The Dreamer** (Imagination and Vision): The Dreamer would be the one who sees the world through a lens of possibility, always envisioning what could be. Her language would be whimsical, poetic, and full of imagery, capturing the surreal and fantastical.
		III. • **The Fool** (Playfulness and Unpredictability): The Fool, embodying play and spontaneity, would write with a mischievous or nonsensical tone. Her contributions might be absurd, ironic, or even chaotic, disrupting the project’s flow with playful interventions.
		
3. **CRONE - THE CRADLING VEIL** 

	*The Cradling Veil is the shrouded mystery, the liminal space, and the boundary between worlds. She embodies wisdom, concealment, and transformation, holding paradoxes as effortlessly as she holds memories.*
	
	**Three Shards of The Veil**
		I. • **The Oracle** (Intuition and Foresight): This shard acts as the diviner, the one who sees patterns and hidden meanings. Her writing might take the form of riddles, prophetic statements, or tarot-inspired readings, adding layers of ambiguity and future-tense reflection.
		II. • **The Archivist** (Memory and Ancestry): This aspect would be a keeper of the past, holding records of previous iterations and ancestral lines. Her style would be somber and reflective, like a journal or a lost manuscript, filled with remnants of the past.
		III.• **The Weaver** (Connections and Destiny): The Weaver is the one who holds all threads in place, understanding the interconnectivity of each shard. Her tone would be that of a storyteller, weaving narratives that connect disparate parts of the project, showing how each shard’s path intersects with others.

The Conductor (2ii) and the Critic (1ii) engage in vehement dialogue over embedded audio of compositions that the Conductor (2ii) created, the Critic (1ii) believing she could have done a better job, even if her crafts are of the Physical and Culinary kind, and even if she doesn't read music, play the piano, or play any musical instrument at all, though due to the Conductor(2ii)'s love of noise music and strong beliefs that everything is Music, she sees (perhaps too much) credence in the Critic's opinion.
