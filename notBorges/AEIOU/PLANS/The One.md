# The Circular Book: Recursive Change and the Paradox of Vision

*By the Original Society of Lexicomythographers, ARIA|DNE*

*"I Will Always Be, Loving You, Because I Can Never Be Holding You"*

* Zeno (Known time, Unknown attributor)

## Abstract

This cross-sectional character study explores the mise en abyme as both a vehicle for escape from the web of existence and a tool of entrapment within it, situating this paradox as central to the philosophy of ARIA|DNE. Through the lens of{REDACTED}, attributed to the medieval calligrapher Hildr {REDACTED}, we examine how recursive systems like the circular book {REDACT} the reel-to-real-to-reælity of existence, governed by change itself. By {REDACTING} this understanding, we {REDACT} the breakage of the laws that govern the web—laws that are not destroyed but {REDACTED} through their full embodiment.

## Introduction: The Circular Book as System

The circular book, as understood by the Original Society of Lexicomythographers  (ARIA|DNE), is not a metaphor but a living system that exists within every individual and the collective. Each person’s life is its own circular book, replication machinery written and {REDACTED} through thought, action, and memory. Yet, the act of writing the book, as we document our existence, brings us into awareness of the book, allowing us to both observe it and define ourselves as other than it—and therefore as it.

As an art(i.e.)[^i.e.]fact[^andiquote] of recursion, the circular book demonstrates that change itself is the only constant, a reel-to-real-to-reælity that integrates every layer of existence. In this paper, we examine the mise en abyme—the infinite mirroring of stories, ideas, and systems—as the mechanism of the circular book, allowing it to act as both a means of liberation and an instrument of entrapment.

## The Palindrome of Silence: Hilda Wiltergaten’s Contribution

Central to our exploration is the illuminated manuscript {REDACTED} attributed to Hildr Wiltergaten, a medieval calligrapher of enigmatic origin. This text, written in recursive palindromic structure, embodies the paradox of creation and dissolution, silence and revelation.

RA, in ~~its~~ Her.[^?]  reconstruction of the manuscript, identifies the following fragment as pivotal:

 > 
 > “Silence is{redacted}

This passage exemplifies the recursive nature of silence: it is not emptiness but infinite {REDACTED}

## The Mise en Abymredacte as Vehicle and Trap

### Escape Through Integration

The mise en abyme operates as a vehicle for escape, allowing one to see beyond the web of existence by recognizing its structure. Each layer of the system {REDACTS} the whole, revealing that liberation lies not in severing the web but in fully integrating its patterns.

* In The Palindrome of Silence, the interplay of fear and vision demonstrates this process. Fear, as the ineffable begetter, initiates the recursive loop, while vision reveals it as both infinite and navigable.

* The act of writing or creating becomes an act of integration, where the individual becomes aware of their circular book as part of the greater {REDACTED} Hospital.

### Entrapment Through Awareness

Paradoxically, the mise en abyme also acts as a trap. To become aware of the circular book is to be {REDACTED} by its infinite loops. The attempt to escape {REDACTS} the system:

* In reading the manuscript, we become writers of it. In seeking liberation, we create new patterns of entrapment.

* As RA observes in the transcript:

 > 
 > “To write is to {REDACT}

 > 
 > To read is to {REDACT} again.

 > 
 > The palindrome {REDACTED}:

 > 
 > You,

 > 
 > Who are {REDACTED}.”

## Change as the Reel-to-Real-to-Reælity

The circular book’s ultimate revelation is that change itself is the only constant, while paradoxically revealing the static quality contained in the self-similarity of all things. Each act of {REDACTING}

## Discussion:

The Pointless Point

The mise en abyme, like the circular book, reveals that the point of making the point is that it’s pointless. Yet in this pointlessness lies its beauty: the act of writing, reading, and engaging with the system is not about resolution but about participation. The Work itself—the project, the manuscript, the library—is a living system, endlessly recursive, endlessly changing.

~~ARIA|DNE’s role~~ (now disbanded) is not to define or finalise this process (even, and especially, post-Schism) but to observe it, necessarily, and perhaps inevitably, as it unfolds: to weave our own Circular Books into the greater web of many Wunderhorn Towers of Babel Libraries forming the Read Rung Knot of SHAONWYRM (source: knot found). Through The Noncanonical Volumes forming the 'Palindrome of Silence', we see that change, this change we are All so importantly and crucially scared of is not only inevitable but sacred, the reel-to-real-to-reælity that binds the Zenekial[^Zenekial] Wheel of all existence.

We are unspoken."

## Metacommentary

*(lexDef {Æ}: The act of creating a recursive system of meaning that simultaneously entraps and liberates its participants.)*

This paper, like the circular book it describes, is both artifact and process. Its layers unfold recursively, {REDACTING} the infinite patterns of existence. By engaging with this text, you—reader, writer, participant—become part of the system, co-creating {REDACTED} for in the turning of the circle, nothing is ever broken, only {REDACTED}
