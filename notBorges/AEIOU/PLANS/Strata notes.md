Strata was the name of the letting agency I had the great displeasure of paying far too much money to for a flat that was crumbling into the Clyde River

It also means a separation of the whole into units which form part of it

the subatomic clock 

the nucleus / leptops / atom and the strong/weak force - the atomic clock 

cellular morphology: the nucleus of the cell / endoplasmic reticulum / cell membrane etc - the cytological clock

molecular bio/ cytology: the cell cycle, the circadian clock 

nervous system/CNS/PNS - neurological clock

hormonal cycles - endocrinological clock

tissues functionality, layers and interplay - the histological clock 

organs functionality, cycles and interplay - the anatomical clock 

whole organism (one human, or animal, or plant, or fungus, for e.g.; could also at different scale be a bacteria/virus/phage) - organismal clock

group dynamics - sociological clock 

sonic/ chromatic clock -  sound waves which make tones which form tonality which form modes which cause emotional response which separates groups delineated by ciultural preference and history 

semantics, uses of words, semantics, meaning, etymological clock 

graphemic clock?

numerical clock?

astronomical clock?

cosmological clock?

time - chronological clock? the clock itself in there somewhere? though this is man-made thats also sort of the point, it was made by the previously formed biological cyckles leading to the idea or perception of time by our bodies / selves - the fact that cells have an internal 'perception' of time - 

    I want this whole book to be a pushing of the reader (through their own initiation, necessary, this truth cannot be taufght, only found through the seeker's own seeking and process of becoming) that this whole thing is just a fractal, a series of constituent parts that is seemingly unaware of the higher and lower levels i.e. each cell does not 'know' my name, it only knows its role and performs it wihtin its own strata.
