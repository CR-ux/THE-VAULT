- Concretise the Nine "Authors" which are split into a trinity each begetting a trinity (Callie, Rose, Petal). Their integration makes Either Ten (9+1) or The Twelve (9 + 3).
- 
- Create "Spine"[^S] of 22 Chapters (A is for Aleph) - this MUST retain 144,000[^II] words total. The Central Codex of the Work could be an “academic paper” on this fictional non-fictional field of Lexicomythography.
- 
- Each time a tangent is followed (via footnotes or stream of consciousness or already written material to be linked), ask yourself "Which shard (of the Nine which are three) is speaking?"
- Include all the planning in a 'hidden' part of the Repo once it is created

Envisage with me a future, which is happening, which has already been and gone:


All of the contributors are actually me, split into their constituent special interests of: 

Creatives (music, writing, illustration) - meaning / maiden
Coders (genomics, technology, numbers) - memory / mother
Contemplatives (occultism, comparative mythology/theology, sacred dance)- crone 


This central “spine” is simply the shroud over Hera’s stone of the philosopher, a red herring to prevent swallowing by Chronos, or, the protection of very vulnerable, personal information embedded deeper within the subsequent fields. 

All of the references are self-made, sometimes fictional, sometimes existing in the web space on separate websites (like my paper on host response to avian influenza, or my creative informatics residency, or performances and musical works I have made)

This paper, a thesis on Lexicomythography written by The Landing Net {of Arachne’s Selch Rhose to Falls}, is 144,000 words exactly; perhaps including footnotes to prevent burnout, and leads to a fractal path of every work I have ever created and every work I ever will , including these fictional characters of the story which is actually a series of Borges - esque short stories, written by (or perhaps , to be written, foreshadowing and “locking in” future projects that have yet to come to fruition, thereby “bagsying” them [I have a lot of problems with my ASD/ADHD that become self-limiting: I go so deep down these roads of modes of expression and then never come back but simultaneously feel so impatient and want desperately to have them out in the world] and providing a source of creative accountability, an online repository/codex of my Ten Thousand Selves - a ridiculously intricate “TODO” list

[^DNA]:As in, the two complimentary strands of DNA.[^Pal]

[^Hip]:The last Six lines of the Hippocratic Oath; which does not begin with "First, do no harm" '***primum non nocere***'[^Wrong]
[^Wrong]:While this widely held misquote is attributed to Hippocrates, and crystallises the essence of the Pact[^Faust] , it isn't a part of the Hippocratic Oath at all.
[^Faust]:Such as in a Faustian Bargain, or the toll that must be paid to cross a threshold. Such as, the bonds of DNA that must be unzipped to separation, in order to come together in multiplicity.
