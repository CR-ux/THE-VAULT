CREATE A DIGITAL CREATIVELY COLLABORATIVE COVEN/COMMUNITY


# **The Arboretum.**


## A CRUCIBLE FOR COLLABORATION

#### IN WHICH
###### your contribution and critique are welcome and appreciated

#### **BUT**
###### neither are expected nor requisite for your presence here.



Hello 
I am very lucky to know a lot of incredibly talented people who are talented in very strange specifically shimmering ways and those people are you 

most of y'all know the following two things: 
1. I been going thru it 
2. I been compulsively and desperately making art as a direct result of the it i been going thru 

and this third thing came to me over the last few months, gnawing like a hungry rat through my intestines until finally chewing through that last nerve in my spine that wasn't letting me believe it:

3. I be coming back to go thru the same it until I let other people into the process that #2 involves 

(*and hey*)
(*to labour the point of the point of joint labour*)
(*and to say you've all been saviours)
(with the ways you've flavoured my depraved and at times tasteless existential states)
(of making my way thru it all with all your awe-inspiring favours)
(for which this fledgling light forgetting face on any wretched sudden drizzling or much too thudding heavy raining day is not ineffably and terribly just ever-infinitely grateful* )

no existential lessons we are supposed to learn from the things we go thru as humans can ever be truly integrated until the individuals going thru the 'it' that is so isolating in its highly specific shade of bleak, at least share the experience of Thing #2 together. Art making is life making (because at this point I'm just insane enough to believe that art has actual sentient life of its own once conceptualised). And the process of coming together in bringing that separate entity, a portal for projection of the personal into the universal, i think that's the fundamental link missing from my life personally that needs to be reforged, or maybe even properly forged in the first place. 

So welcome hello 
My chaotic rabbitholing brain needs structure 
and some form of externalised creative accountability 
and honestly the loftyness of most of my concepts can simply never reach their intended and destined execution without many, many trusted hands. and I trust all of yours with the very life that each of you has helped save in some way 

because babbling poetry aside, literally 
thank you each of you, for everything up to now and for everything that may be, 
for fucking saving me every goddamn time 

the artmaking is the vehicle 
but i can't goddamn drive it anywhere
i got no fuckin license 


Please feel free to hop in and out if and whenever you wish! 

i am hoping to somehow set up and integrate either a calendar applet, a timeline, or both, to have a set of visual maps tagged with fields of interest for people to peruse and take part in should they feel so moved. 

I thought about using emails, but really discord is the best for the functionality necessary for a secure and safe place to come together and make creative things happen. 

there are infinite permutations of you, maybe some of you yet to directly interact, who could hypothetically benefit each others' work / projects / creative goals in some way, so hopefully no matter what this can spark the forging of those creative alliances. I can't know this many cool and creative people and not have them know each other that's silly! 









send amessage to patrons letting them know personally awhat's going on 



USE the community message space to share vulnerable information that would otherwise be corssing a self-boundary and drain vital essence. directly ocmmunicating allows for no heartbreak of screaming into a void of no response. even if there is no response, you know they have read it.

create a list of their unique talents, skills, ways of working, general availabilities and time commitment capabilities

create a list of all project ideas into a concise, bulleted and visual  (networked) form using obsidian. individual project components should be tagged with the skills and talents required to execute said component *flawlessly* and *to completion.* This is vital. Do **not** consider sharing a project component with the outside world *until* you have tagged and allocated a team appropriately. This team can be comprised of human and non-human members, self, or other. 

Each component should also be notated with the amount of time required to bring the project to its completion. Perhaps in a kanban modality, to view the timelines of each and therefore know the best order of operations to tackle The Work. 


Requirements for sharing a project component: 
- tagged with requisite skills 
- notated with time estimation 
- delegations added 
- log of work completed maintained and up to date 




Every day, the ritual is as follows: 
Open The Heart 
- Allow the eyes to open 
- Close them once more 
- Breathe in and out three times with focus entirely on this process and allow awareness to be narrow as a laser upon only this process for these three, nourishing and reviving breaths of Being. 
- Spend however much time as is necessary in order to ground the self, write stream of consciousness insights carried in the Return from the Spirit realm upon waking, providing oneself a sense of utter peace and safety in the brief initial precious moments of first waking consciousness. 
- 
Open The Crucible 
- Review any work done on the previous day, adding to logs accordingly (10m)
- Reach out to anyone to reel them into the component in question if needed, or draft any correspondence for the future execution of such.
