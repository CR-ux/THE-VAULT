"*Lonely contains the Word 'One'*.
*One begins with an O. Which is also the shape of Zero, or No-Thingness. 
The Word 'One' ends with an E. Which is for Every One."

"The Loneliest Carp is the One out of the Ten Thousand, and containing the Ten Thousand within her, who makes the jump over the waterfall, which ends with the Word 'All' - becoming the Dragon, roaring the Fire of Will which set this Holy Hole of Wholeness into motion."



I envisage and therefore manifest a future in which this evolving narrative sustains my entire life as a magnum opus I constantly add to until I die

  
The Arachnian Collective ties to the concept of 'web' (as in, of Wyrd, or Maya or a dreamworld which is also reality woven by a spider) katabasis: an underworld opera (my debut album - lonely carp - itself a fantastic foreshadowing for the forthcoming 'loneliness' in the paradox of finding myself and the separated but unified parts of my self creating an entire 'school' of fish or rather, in the process of becoming a 'school', increasing the chance of one, just one, who is all of them, jump up the waterfall to become a dragon, as in longmen mythology, which states "Not a single carp, however, out of a hundred, a thousand, or even ten thousand, can climb the falls, not even after ten or twenty years." - the ten thousand things. the infinite allowing one, which contains the many, to jump the falls and transform, thereby, even in his loneliness, carry the whole with him. (In adventures such as these, I have squandered and wasted my years. It does not seem unlikely to me that there is a total book on some shelf of the universe; I pray to the unknown gods that a man--just one, even though it were thousands of years ago!--may have examined and read it. If honor and wisdom and happiness are not for me, let them be for others. Let heaven exist, though my place be in hell. Let me be outraged and annihilated, but for one instant, in one being, let your enormous Library be justified.-Borges) given these insights, help me come up with a name for the 'fictional' collective of Ten Thousand Carp
