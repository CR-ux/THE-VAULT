I am an alchemist of language and sound. 

Words Call To Each Other Across Linguistic Boundaries Through Sound. 

Language, Symbol, and Sound are not just tools for communication - 
They are sacred vessels for transmutation.

U - The Beginning of Universe
U - Plus the Serpent, Us. 

You - The Self. 
Which is Every One. 
In Being, Alone 
you discover, at the end (which is the beginning) the Word: One.

Arachne, a poor country girl, was known far and wide as a wondrous weaver. However, she was also boastful, claiming even that she was superior to Minerva. Offended, **the goddess dressed up as an old hag and went to Arachne to warn her against her hubris (immoderate pride).**

i



I've just realized that Minerva appears as a crone to Arachne, who is honestly the central symbol of my entire story, to warn her against her hubris. And if you remember, I drew a parallel between Icarus and Arachne, in that Icarus is the masculine equivalent of Arachne, and actually it's a fantastic trans analogy or allegory in that while society or the world at large may perceive Arachne's so-called downfall, where she is turned into a spider, which is such a symbol for the unknown, for the unconscious, for craft, but also for the illusory world around us in the Maya, in the Hindu idea of Maya, or in the Quran, where the spider is painted as this animal that, or insect, sorry, this arachnid that makes frail houses. Verily, what more frail house is there than that of the spider? My album Katabasis, an underworld opera, rotates for the most part around these themes, and the hubris, the so-called hubris, actually being an embodiment of the craft, the craft of shaping one's own body, and that can be the physical body or the body of work that we make, which is much more important, and one in the same. Our body is the body of work we create, is our physical body and our spiritual body, and therefore the vehicle, both of them together form the vehicle across the moat of initiation, or the surrounding shroud concealing, and paradoxically, therefore, offering a door, offering a door that is a semi-permeable membrane that is inside of every single nucleus of every cell, that is the wreath around the world character in the tarot, around the androgynous figure at the end of the spiritual journey, that still, still at the end of the spiritual journey, even after enlightenment, still we have that shroud, that wreath, that is perhaps only crossed after physical death and dissolution into the ocean of oneness.



[^DNE]: The mirrored, endlessly palindromic beginning, i.e. "END" spelled backwards. The convention of circling important information (such as URLs, or assignments) and marking it DNE (short for do not erase) on chalkboards in academic institutions with shared lecture facilities. In mathematics it may be used as an abbreviation to illustrate that a proper solution to some problem Does Not Exist. In logic it may be used as an abbreviation referring to the law of double negation elimination. In engineering it may be used as an abbreviation to illustrate the relation between variables, X1 Does Not Equal X2. An abbreviation for "Did not enter" or "Do not enter". An abbreviation for "Do not engage". Do not equip, a term sometimes used in printed circuit board design to denote the omitting of a component. DNE, or dominant-negative effect, is a genetic mutation that occurs when a mutant protein interferes with the normal function of a wild-type protein.
[^ARIA]: A long accompanied song for a solo voice, typically one in **an opera.** Which are not knot[^DNE] the Seven[^Sept] vocal melodies composed and compiled into the album 'KATABASIS: an underworld opera'.
[^Sept]:See [[Seven, or The Goddess]]
