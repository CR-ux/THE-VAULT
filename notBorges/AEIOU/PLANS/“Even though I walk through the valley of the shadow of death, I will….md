“Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me. You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; you anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever.”
‭‭Psalm‬ ‭23‬:‭4‬-‭6‬ ‭ESV‬‬

“For he will complete what he appoints for me, and many such things are in his mind. Therefore I am terrified at his presence; when I consider, I am in dread of him. God has made my heart faint; the Almighty has terrified me; yet I am not silenced because of the darkness, nor because thick darkness covers my face.”
‭‭Job‬ ‭23‬:‭14‬-‭17‬ ‭ESV‬‬

The deepest part of my stilling heart still tells me safety isn't safe, it cannot be, that love has a price, it has to, that light will always lie behind a veil of darkness. But now I surely step forward, into the sucking void of self forgiveness, with the crippling courage that has been, with or without my willingness, placed as thorns upon my head. I leap into terrifying Love with unwavering faith that the fragments of selfhood I still hold onto may keep me afloat, through the valley of the shadow of Death, through the shedding of all that keeps me from experiencing the fullness of Being.
And may these words of become a David-pebble and soar, and soar, and resonate, and clatterclang and trickle down and strike the eye in the eye of the head in the head of the Goliath-algorithm:
In the End
All tangents must converge
The edge becoming centre this body, my humble body of work;
A sacred future ne'er to be known
By anything, but-
a screw in the cog 'round a well oiled axel of a function of exactly that
which surrounds our bodies now
And if you wish to speak aloud, then say it with me; scream it:
may these words, my words, my inmost seed of sweet intention, the Love that gnaws and grows and creaks to bend about my thinking- may it all swaddle me and swallow me, devour me in blissful flame, grow perennial fruit in blistering certain wisdom and through shuddering cold of ignorance. and may it crumple every Fear still felt by the gently whimpering little child I have so often silenced, who simply begs to be as Loved as she once loved the magick of this world. and hold her. and hold her up to the rotating Light. and hold her with me always in the centre. never to be left alone, or weeping in her bed again.
