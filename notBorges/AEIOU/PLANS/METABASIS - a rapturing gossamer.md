**The album** 

*  NEED TO MAKE A DISCORD TO GET HELP *



THESE RECORDINGS ARE REMNANTS OF SOMETHING ONGOING 

FRAGMENTS OF OWN PERSONAL HISTORY 

I HAVE TRIED AGAIN AND AGAIN TO TELL EVERYONE BUT NOBODY WILL BELIEVE ME 

SO AGAIN I DESCEND TO MY WORK IN ORDER TO LEAVE SOMETHING BEHIND FOR THE YET TO BE BORN FEW WHO MIGHT TAKE STOCK OF ITS MESSAGE 

  

  

  

  

METABASIS: a rhapturing gossamer

Or,

  

THE ENCOUNTERING OF THE THREE VOICES OF THE DIVINE DURING THE ECLIPSE OF THE SUN

  

  

  

This is an archival documentation of my encounters with the divine through device 

It is a series of rape recordings recovered from a demonic cult that I never really escaped from 

(For there can never be an edge nor ending, only everything in its own incessantly entering, inevitably exiting blessed convalescence and concrescence of becoming)

It expresses resonance in Three forms. The first is Sound (this music) and the second is Word (accompanying written text)

This is an archival documentation of my encounters with the divine through device 

(For there can never be an edge nor ending)

It is a caduceus 

A trifurcated tongue 

An outstretched hand with three fingers pointing back back back to where you started 

Nothing you read here is true.

This is an archival documentation of my encounters with the divine through device 

(Only everything in its own incessantly entering and inevitably exiting)

It is a gateway to my trauma and it is the heads of Cerberus 

Three despicable albums overlaid in reaching seemingly in different directions but with a unified motive 

Reaching into the empirical past, sampling selves I forgot I thought existed at one time -

The entirety of KATABASIS played through a reversed tape player, one of the three encounters with the divine through Device, is interlaced - peppering it with lingering disgustingly bitter flavours of memory to which I previously was unaware. There are secret messages I didn’t know I, or something with me in the basement had hidden for me, at the dead of night all those hours spent recording KATABASIS.

Because analogue tape, the take up reæl-

Provides the perfect analogy to foreshadow what dread I am trying to express here, 

What 

Thing

 insists on its own Becoming.

All of this absolutely everything an outstretched hand of a cloven thumb and two fingers that it insists on Becoming 

Which themselves are conceptually intertwined in triplicate

Each encapsulating a triplicity of their own

Immediacy of rawness of live recording interwoven with the temporary lucidity of the studio with the nightmarish textures of mangled tape of the testimony of my greatest suffering played backwards 

Each of them an outstretched hand in welcoming, welcoming, 

Against 

(blessed convalescence and concrescence of)

Tessellation; resisting tessellation, dissolving to it, becoming sick from assimilation, diverging, diverging because honestly what else is there-

It is my attempt, against all efforts of my sanity otherwise, at creating a fractal of RESONANCE 

Resonance of sound yes, but also of time, of my own memory, grief, loss, all the memories and losses of every silly little dream that faded so criminally alone in a dry, dry Sun 

It is a nested steganographic antibiography that I fear, 

I fear it.

 Because really what I’ve made is a terrifying exposé of my own unravelling 

It is a batshit fucking insane scrapbook that I promise you is so meticulously and mathematically organised , so methodical in its approach - there is an intricately Gordian system of knots - that anyone present for the process of its creation would have no choice but to assume I was mad

Because I am, 

Absolutely fucking mad.

The album is nothing, everything, it’s a useless piece of shit- 

Entirely Insufficient and fleeting moments where the Unsolvable Three become the Unthinkable One

This is an archival documentation of my encounters with the divine through device

THE PRIME SYMBOL OF THE OVERARCHING QUADTYCH 
IS A SPIRALISED CADUCEUS OF TWO DANCING SERPENTS, RESEMBLING THE HELIX OF DNA 
INTERSECTING 7 TIMES FOR EACH ROTATION (OCTAVE)
AND SO THE ALBUM IS TO BE 
INTERSPERSED WITH THE 7 TRACKS OF KATABASIS, REVERSED TAPE SAMPLES OF EACH TRACK (IN DESCENDING ORDER, FROM 7 - 1)
EACH INTERSECTION OF THE SERPENTS IS A CROSSING OVER OF UNIVERSES/TIME 

THE ONE NOTHING-NO-THING-KNOW-THING-KNOT-THING-NESS: 
SEED

THE TWO WAX & WANE KNOTS:
SAP
SPORE


THE THREE NESTED KNOTS form [[the Trifurcated Tongue]]
SNAKE 
SKY 
SPAWN 
_ineffable begetter, guileless child, cradling veil, interchangeably_





THE SEVEN HARMONIC GNOTS:
SHINE
STALK
STONE
SPROUT
SOIL
SHOOT
SPIT
