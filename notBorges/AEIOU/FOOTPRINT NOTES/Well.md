[[lexDef "Well"]] : {REDACTED}

**Well (n.)**: A deep source of water, often concealed beneath the earth’s surface; a font of life-sustaining liquid, drawn upon in times of need[^1]; metaphorically, a repository of wisdom, emotion, or creativity[^2][^3], waiting to be tapped; a convergence of unseen forces, where surface and depth intermingle[^1.1][^2.1.1^] [^1.1^] [^2.1^] [^2] , offering nourishment to those who seek its hidden reservoirs that run both at the surface of depth and source of shallowness.






[^1^]: This essential resource has been a symbol of sustenance and mystery in many cultures[^1.1].
