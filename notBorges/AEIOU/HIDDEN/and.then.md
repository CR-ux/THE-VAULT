all of this is for nobody but my own incessant need to make something incredibly committed and needlessly complex moreso for when Iâ€™m dead and even if it were in a thousand years someone autistic enough might be like woah wtf and write a PhD on it
and then all of this would have been for nothing but my own incessant need to make everything needlessly committed and incredibly complex; so for more death and odd years, thousands of them, anyone autistic enough would perhaps, maybe, breathe life, re-woven, into mine. 
and then maybe i'll be immortalised by the very system which kept me from living while i was alive,
and then maybe i'll always, always be dying 
and then definitely, i'll finally 
live
