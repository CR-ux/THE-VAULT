*_Their names are not merely markers but dry-wipe palimpsests upon a makeshift whiteboard. Each layer unveiling, not just who they (plural) are but how they (singular) came to be. To read the reams of writings of Ed. O. as read by D&E and rewrite the readings taken by D&E written in red is a reading exercise in reaming. Which is to say to read, is to write the infinite layers of stories unwritten beneath them, unread because unready for writing—each an anagram of the last, each a proof[^pudding] doctored[^forgery] by the act of reading._*


To 'Observe Silence' has two meanings, both of which fracture into myriad splinter meanings. 
For the purposes of this work, I wish to draw the reader's attention to two mirrors of intent:


1. To be a Silent presence which is Observed, 
		or, contrastingly and indeed simultaneously-
0. To be Observing a Silent Presence. 
1. The two characters of this layered lettuce of a story made of letters between a cast of characters-


-We shall call them Prof. Ed. O. and Dr D. E., were both performing both functions of the above dualistic premises. On premises. 
	The Premise being that D. would help E. understand the so-called 'Hermitesque[^lexDefU] Spiralling' witnessed by their
colleagues and students in the middle of their final lecture, through a series of intensive dream studies and in-house analyses, the 'house' being Professor E's house, or premises. 

D felt, sick with how much delight she seemed to feel bubble in her heart's caldera, each time the Professor's presentation increased in its baffling complexity. 

Having supposedly taken a vow of silence with an immanently dispersed and unnamed force, buried within the 
words describing insects to which they dedicated their life contributing to the research of; their correspondence was only given through web-like linguistic "Gnots", or, (in E (or indeed Ed. O.)'s 'words'):. 

> 		'words-sword-swarm-warlike-drone-osophy- sophila siloed philo's drosophilic cross section of clementine my darling race to arms of ardent cause and loving face locked in place for all causal proximity loci[^loci]' 


which they would usually write in dry-wipe marker on the white acrylic of their apartment' kitchen cupboards. Never without 'signing' each anagrammatic sigil; this left a peculiar appearance of a person (singular), desperate to credit themselves (plural), so as not to appear to their clinical Observer (plural) as an entity that had fallen into multiplicity (singular).

Paradoxically, or perhaps in parallel to this, due to the dry-wipe pen's inherently transient nature as a medium, at any given time, communication would be less of linear process and more of a geometric exploration of meaning across graphemic structures of memory. 

Professor Ed. O. would often begin a day with a "Seed" Word, much like they (singular) were opening an infinitely spiralling series of Scrabble matches with them (plural)-selves, erasing and replacing letters like some deranged cruciverbalist, and try, in futility, to flatten the Nine Dimensional paradigm of perception they had recently entered (exiting the world of Academia) as a result of their silence, into a Two-dimensional net, the design field being their kitchen cupboards, mostly just filled with empty plastic Tupperware once holding packed lunch items within packed lunches, packed within the empty plastic longing for its emptiness as its filler longs for filling; sealed and closed inside one another, in ways the Doctor of Anthroarachnojungian Analysis had never even conceptualised, even through all her years after hours, covertly battling on the front lines of competitive Tetris like her (higher, apparently) Three-Dimensional psychiatric practice, was a day job for her more grand pursuits in the dimension (supposedly) below[^Turningtables].

Currently[^currently], the cupboards held as palimpsests, the remnants of proofs of quite genius ideas, that poor Ed. O. (or E. O., or just Ed. or--) once poured over but now, either edified nor obtuse in their obsessions with letters and the insects written to them, or their obsessions with insect-written letters in their Opus of Experiments on the Oscillating Elocution of Odomata[^Odo] (Prof. Ed. O. & OE[^OE] & Co. Year E0), or in their Expedition  E has discarded like grocery shopping lists, offer glimpses into a mind quite mad. D had recalled in the preceding week while living with Ed, The Myth of The Witch Peering Into The Macroscope; Supplementary Data on the Mesh of Epiphragil [^dr], whether through dreams or waking reality, she could not remember exactly. All that emerged as important in this current moment, was the symbol of the Wave Function Collapse- as an example of phenomenological mis en abyme[^N.B.].


Within the Professor's mind(s), one proof kept emerging itself, screaming its own insistence on becoming. They were not equipped, or rather, they (singular) thought them (plural) selves into thinking that they (plural) were not equipped, to appropriately "Draw down the Moon"[^Moon] of this interconnected system of Ideas (singular). 

But if anybody (plural) could do it (dual), they (singular) could.

Knot knowing this, they began, again, Dr. E. still sleeping in the sun-blemished corner of the apartment, but soon to be, woken, by what was perceived in their dreamscape as the squeaking of rats; threatening to bite her exposed ankles, which, coupled with the simultaneous sensory input of her Arctic Salmon pink silk trousers caressing her ever-epilated and raw skin, gave the synæsthetic illusion of embodied reality. 

Jolting upright in both physical space and the quantum space of neural frequency through a laddered series of strata, known all-to-well by the psychiatrist, she took no prisoners, as in, she wasted no time in switching on her Field[^field] recorder on the coffee table in front of her, which sat upon a copy of *The Gesamtkunstwerk of Wiltergarden*, which seemed to be, for lack of a better word, gnawed around the edges. 

Beginning immediately, which is to say with quite some fumbling, flipping Three Dimensional sheets of paper attempting to manifest them (singular) selves in Two Dimensions for the purposes of Three Dimensional transcribing; but them (plural) selves not quite getting it right, still requiring a 'depth' of the notebook; the spine of which was slightly thicker than the pad of lined paper (no margin) it held together. A series of metal coils, like the copper wiring of a particle supercollider, or the strand of DNA used to encode the proteins necessary for such a creation, seemed to, for lack of a better word, gnaw into each hole of the notebook at the top. At the same time as appearing an action willed by this cruelty of metal, against the cross sections of Tree branch cadavers, the ringed prongs also, quite calmly, acted as the closed jaw of the Idea archiving device itself, with the 'holes' at the top of the paper, both securing it and allowing its potential severance from the manuscript horde, acting as 'sockets' in some Dodecadental Dragon so often told in bedtime stories to children with the unconscious purpose of transmitting Archetypal Information across generations, through a necessary 'wire', or 'device', resulting in a 'dream', which is a device wired to a dreamer.

Again, beginning immediately, she observed (as best she thought she could) the 'mad'[^lexDefU4] professor's scribbling, Body language[^lexDefU5], and Breathing[^DNA]
