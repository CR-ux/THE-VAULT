I'm developing an incredibly complex conlang (termed AZOTHYXH) which is also a Magick system / divinatory tool. It is a layered, multi-form communication system, comprising a semantic (spoken), symbolic(scrawled) and somatic (signed) component. A forked tongue of three tines. A Trilinguadendrexicon.
I plan for the story of its discovery (in Enochian style; fictional but marketed as nonfictional/ancient)/creation to be the narrative, allegorical 'canon' of my musical releases , providing a contextual lore. 
Mythology of Dragon's Gate - 'lonely carp' moniker change to something related to the lore of AZOTHYXH/SHAONWYRM.
AZOTH is the magick system (Alcehmical Zephyr of Tarot Heuristics)
AZOTHYXH is the proper noun / the language (pronounced Az-Oath-ee-oozh)
AZOTHYX (Az-Oath-Eaze) is the adjective (e.g. the AZOTHYX alphabet)
