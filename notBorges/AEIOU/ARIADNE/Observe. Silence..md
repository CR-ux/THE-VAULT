 or No Thing. i.e. {{lexDef}} All Th\[12\]re Is, Is: Meaning

 METACOMMENTARY

**Their names are not merely markers but dry-wipe palimpsests upon a makeshift whiteboard. Each layer unveiling, not just who they (plural) are but how they (singular) came to be. To read the reams of writings of Ed. O. as read by Dot Code and rewrite the readings taken by Dot Code written in red is a reading exercise in reaming. Which is to say to read, is to write the infinite layers of stories unwritten beneath them, unread because unready for writing—each an anagram of the last, each a proof[^pudding] doctored[^forgery] by the act of reading.**

To 'Observe Silence' has two meanings, both of which fracture into myriad splinter meanings.
For the purposes of this work, I wish to draw the reader's attention to two mirrors of intent:

1. To be a Silent presence which is Observed,
   or, contrastingly and indeed simultaneously-
1. To be Observing a Silent Presence.
1. The two characters of this layered lettuce of a story made of letters between a cast of characters-

-We shall call them Prof. Ed. O. and Dr Dot Code, were both performing both functions of the above dualistic premises. On premises.
The Premise being that D. would help E. understand the so-called 'Hermitesque[^lexDefU] Spiralling' witnessed by their
colleagues and students in the middle of their final lecture, through a series of intensive dream studies and in-house analyses, the 'house' being Professor E's house, or premises.

During their time together, or perhaps, quite necessarily separate, they would invent The Device. In essence a Polygraph machine, but one that translates and transcribes the content of a person's dreams. 

Dot felt, sick with how much delight she seemed to feel bubble in her heart's caldera, each time the Professor's presentation increased in its baffling complexity.

Having supposedly taken a vow of silence with an immanently dispersed and unnamed force, buried within the
words describing insects to which they dedicated their life contributing to the research of; their correspondence was only given through web-like linguistic "Gnots", or, (in E (or indeed Ed. O.)'s 'words'):.

 > 
 >       'words-sword-swarm-warlike-drone-osophy- sophila siloed philo's drosophilic cross section of clementine my darling race to arms of ardent cause and loving face locked in place for all causal proximity loci[^loci]' 
 >     

which they would usually write in dry-wipe marker on the white acrylic of their apartment' kitchen cupboards. Never without 'signing' each anagrammatic sigil; this left a peculiar appearance of a person (singular), desperate to credit themselves (plural), so as not to appear to their clinical Observer (plural) as an entity that had fallen into multiplicity (singular).

Paradoxically, or perhaps in parallel to this, due to the dry-wipe pen's inherently transient nature as a medium, at any given time, communication would be less of linear process and more of a geometric exploration of meaning across graphemic structures of memory.

Professor Ed. O. would often begin a day with a "Seed" Word, much like they (singular) were opening an infinitely spiralling series of Scrabble matches with them (plural)-selves, erasing and replacing letters like some deranged cruciverbalist, and try, in futility, to flatten the Nine Dimensional paradigm of perception they had recently entered (exiting the world of Academia) as a result of their silence, into a Two-dimensional net, the design field being their kitchen cupboards, mostly just filled with empty plastic Tupperware once holding packed lunch items within packed lunches, packed within the empty plastic longing for its emptiness as its filler longs for filling; sealed and closed inside one another, in ways the Doctor of Anthroarachnojungian Analysis had never even conceptualised, even through all her years after hours, covertly battling on the front lines of competitive Tetris like her (higher, apparently) Three-Dimensional psychiatric practice, was a day job for her more grand pursuits in the dimension (supposedly) below[^Turningtables].

Currently[^currently], the cupboards held as palimpsests, the remnants of proofs of quite genius ideas, that poor Ed. O. (or E. O., or just Ed. or--) once poured over but now, either edified nor obtuse in their obsessions with letters and the insects written to them, or their obsessions with insect-written letters in their Opus of Experiments on the Oscillating Elocution of Odomata[^Odo] (Prof. Ed. O. & OE[^OE] & Co. Year E0), or in their Expeditions over Everest-Esque Ontologies of Etymological Origin, has discarded like grocery shopping lists, offer glimpses into a mind quite mad. D had recalled in the preceding week while living with Ed, The Myth of The Witch Peering Into The Macroscope; Supplementary Data on the Mesh of Epiphragil [^dr], whether through dreams or waking reality, she could not remember exactly. All that emerged as important in this current moment, was the symbol of the Wave Function Collapse- as an example of phenomenological mis en abyme[^N.B.].

Within the Professor's mind(s), one proof kept emerging itself, screaming its own insistence on becoming. They were not equipped, or rather, they (singular) thought them (plural) selves into thinking that they (plural) were not equipped, to appropriately "Draw down the Moon"[^Moon] of this interconnected system of Ideas (singular).

But if anybody (plural) could do it (dual), they (singular) could.

Knot knowing this, they began, again, Dr. Dot Code still sleeping in the sun-blemished corner of the apartment, succumbing to Symbol even She could not decipher; but soon to be, woken, by what was perceived in their dreamscape as the squeaking of nibbling rats, themselves crawling with teething insects, themselves teeming with replicating bacteria; threatening to bite her exposed ankles, which, coupled with the simultaneous sensory input of her Arctic Salmon pink silk trousers caressing her ever-epilated and raw skin, gave the synæsthetic illusion of embodied reality.

Jolting upright in both physical space and the quantum space of neural frequency through a laddered series of strata, known all-to-well by the psychiatrist, she took no prisoners, as in, she wasted no time in switching on her Field\[^field\] recorder on the coffee table in front of her, which sat upon a copy of *The Gesamtkunstwerk of Wiltergarden*, which seemed to be, for lack of a better word, gnawed around the edges, on top of which sat The Device, which she ensured was turned on (which of course, it always was),

Beginning immediately, which is to say with quite some fumbling, flipping Three Dimensional sheets of paper attempting to manifest them (singular) selves in Two Dimensions for the purposes of Three Dimensional transcribing; but them (plural) selves not quite getting it right, still requiring a 'depth' of the notebook; the spine of which was slightly thicker than the pad of lined paper (no margin) it held together. A series of metal coils, like the copper wiring of a particle supercollider, or the strand of DNA used to encode the proteins necessary for such a creation, seemed to, for lack of a better word, gnaw into each hole of the notebook at the top. At the same time as appearing an action willed by this cruelty of metal, against the cross sections of Tree branch cadavers, the ringed prongs also, quite calmly, acted as the closed jaw of the Idea archiving device itself, with the 'holes' at the top of the paper, both securing it and allowing its potential severance from the manuscript horde, acting as 'sockets' in some Dodecadental Dragon so often told in bedtime stories to children with the unconscious purpose of transmitting Archetypal Information across generations, through a necessary 'wire', or 'device', resulting in a 'dream', which is a device wired to a dreamer.

It would be these two, as One, or perhaps, many, many more, that would create The Device that would revolutionise the Waking World, by bringing into it the One held within Dreams.

CASE STUDY 9
    
Re-Covered From the Writing Desk of Dr. Dot Code  
Date: Unknown

Subject, One Professor Ed. O., seems to have all but given up their white-cupboard cruxiverbal communication technique, once a fascinating tool for my Arachnoanthropological Analysis. Originally, this was disheartening, as it provided a window into their Gnoelogical Landscape, particularly for unpacking Oneirological Findings (their nightly bouts of sleep paralysis provided a sweet FA of Epsilon brainwaves - a novel neurological signal I have discovered and only found within this, sole, subject, hence its 'E, ε' character denotation). However, this next larval stage of correspondence, performed through their chosen IDE (EdeniaStudio, St. M. Endive, ERA_Æ), is an even deeper (albeit exponentially more confusing) well of Meaning and Memory, and I know, if I can just decode its technological Labyrinthine components, this may offer a groundbreaking insight into their baffling presentation, and potentially be the greatest discovery in the Field of Arachnoanthrology in the last Three Millenia.

 FINDINGS SO FAR 

---

The language, what I am terming an 'esoegododecagoralang (EeDdlang), appears to follow set rules, some of which I have deduced using reverse transcription methodology, and discovered the inner workings of the communication system are lifted from our Devouring Mother Field of Boustrophilology:

 COMPOLYMERASE 

- The Professor has created a custom compiler that sits 'on top' of the language's syntactical layer, which works as the Compolymerases in Lexicomythographic Studies.
	- This compiler has iterated through Three stages of development, and from what I can see so far, both the Second and Third 'versions' of the Compiler (ComPolII & ComPolIII) are used interchangeably to compile the code. These do not appear to map to the Second and Third Order Compolymerases of Boustrophilology.
	- However, these Compolymerases do 'Scan' the code in a Boustrophilological⇄ modality.

 'SYMPHONEMES' 

- Each 'codon block', or modular component of the 'Sophtware' is comprised of Nine, and only ever Nine, lines.
- These component blocks are to be termed 'Symphonies', and are the smallest possible 'unit' of communication.

 DAYLINE 'C{LEF(T)}'s, THE FIRST SEVEN LINES OF THE 'SYMPHONEME': 

- These lines seem to be annotated (to the left of the line separators within the customised IDE) with the Archaic 'Days of the Week' from anteAntiquity, forming the first Seven 'Daylines' of each Symphoneme.
- The 'Sunday' (Day of Semibreve Rest) and finally, a Ninth Line, or 'Coda' (the only one without a C{Lef(t)}) is terminated with the keystone ":OdE":

`Mo:`  
`Tu:`  
`We:`  
`Th:`  
`Fr:`  
`Sa:`  
`Su: EdO:`

- These First Seven Lines of the Symphoneme form the 'Opera Reading Frame', or the 'coding' component of the Sophtware.

 THE EIGHTH LINE OF EXSANGUINIMITY 

- The Eighth line of each Symphoneme C{Lef(t)}ed by what we, in my Field of Study, believe to have once represented a concept called 'Equality', "=",

`=:`

- The Body of this line is composed of a blank line. Always blank, in every Symphoneme.
- This line appears to be 'noncoding (ncOdE)', instead providing a placeholder for the programmer's moment of reflection
	- This conclusion was drawn through observing the Prof. take a momentary pause (almost imperceptible, but with close inspection of brainwave signals, always present), in which they will ensure their spine is erect, and take a breath, as an opera singer preparing for a particularly powerful closing note of their Aria.

 THE NINTH LINE OF RHO-DENDRITIC-REDUNDANCY 

- This final line acts as a transcription terminator, signalling the end (and beginning) of the Symphoneme.

``:OdE

 DISCUSSION 

From what I can gather as yet, Prof. Ed. O. appears to be in a process of 'lifting over' Lexicomythographic methodology to Sophtware development, apparently attempting to 'interface the ineffable'. Personally, I do not see this as ever being possible, and this may mark the beginning of the end for the professor. I am incredibly worried for their wellbeing on a personal level. However, for the sake of this heretofore unseen opportunity for the advancement of Arachnoanthropological Science, studies will continue this evening at 23:00 hours.

⇄: Gnoeneogrecian: _βουστροφηδόν_, “as the ox plows” is a writing style where lines are read in alternating directions. Back-and-forth, as an Ox plowing a field in anteAntiquity. Rooted in _bous_ (Ox, Taurus, Saint Luke) and _strephein_ (to Turn). This reading style forms the central pillar of contemplation in work by my contemporaries in the Field of Boustrophilology[^BTF]

The study planned for eleven PM had not been conducted, For following the descent into some seemingly untranslatable tongue through their terminal, Dr Code had concocted an arsenal of pharmaceuticals that she used to keep the tortured mind at ease, or rather, what she believed as ease, which was of course, just 'easier to deal with'. She found no use in their waking self, voraciously typing in the baffling, so-called 'Edo|odE', and endlessly scrawling word salad, the type with ingredients she couldn't stomach or digest -- she much preferred the unpredictable, but still translatable, output of The Device's analysis of their dreams. 

There was a part, a not insignificant part, of Dot, which understood what she was doing was wrong. But the larger, more significant part, held that all of this imprisonment was for the greater good of Numanity. 

Which it was, or is; just not in the way She envisioned. 

Dr Code's Dissociative Identity Disorder had seemingly descended into uncontrollable emergence at the same rate as the Professor's descent into Schizoid mutism, and she often wondered if they were caught in some infernal loop of _Folie_ à _deux_ - waking up from dreams finding new watercolour paintings that she could not recall painting had alerted her to the intensification of her presentation, and it was this fear of succumbing to a similar, but individuated mental illness as the Professor, that led to her finally taking the plunge, which is to say, plunging a syringe of enough sedative to put a small whale to sleep, into the Ear of Ed. O. while they slept. 

The frequency of appearance of unexplained paintings seemed, at least for now, or then, to fade away like the forgetting of a dream, and so she resolved to maintain the Professor's somnolent state for the rest of their time together; however long that may be. 

It wasn't as if anybody missed Ed. O.. they were, notoriously, a hermit, who had recently taken Sabbatical from their academic post, and to her knowledge, they (singular/plural) hadn't let anybody know about their (plural/singular) agreement to perform live-in experiments in order to excavate the aetiology of Ed's eccentricity. 

And besides, given the entirely groundbreaking nature of the work they'd started together, she surmised that the Prof. would have supported, or at least understood, or at the very least succumbed to, the idea of perpetual sedation. For the sake of Science. It was Science that they'd helped create, after all. 


While the two of them occupied opposing sides of the lexAcademic spectrum, being aligned with ARIA's Arachnolexical and DNE's entoetymological focuses respectively, she believed, as a Jungian Psychiatrist, that it was this opposing difference that would win them many, many, academic awards. She had been through too much, and through the deciphering of their dreams, via symbol (as in archetypal, through The Device of Jungian analysis, and as in glyph, through analysing The Device), She had learned, at least in part, just how much the Professor had been through, too. 

However, it was around Three Weeks into the Spider-fascinated Psychiatrists entrapment of the insect-obsessed Professor, when her paintings began to spontaneously combust. 

A woman of science (albeit a nonmaterial science), she was perplexed, but did not immediately jump to supernatural conclusions. But said conclusions were somewhat unavoidable, once the third painting in a week to combust, left behind an unavoidably insectoid visage. 

Six legs (crucially, not Eight) protruded, in the negative space left by the fires that she quickly found herself dousing and stamping to extinguish, from each of the gaping holes in the canvases. She began to wonder, perhaps with good reason, or as good a reason as she could muster, whether it was a member of her system of identities playing tricks on her, some deeply submerged aspect of her splintered subconscious, or even an aspect of the swarm of unconsciouses we know as the collective of consciousness itself -- but the symbolism was simply far too *Edoian* for it not to be the Professor, somehow, reaching through the realm of dreams, into the waking world. 


She ceased the experiments. 

On the Professor's waking, obviously still saying nothing, they denoted in a language not dissimilar to the one The Device was compiled in, but certainly not the same - one that, quite terrifyingly, involved a series of buzzing and clicking sounds to accompany the written language outlined in her earlier case studies, that it was not in fact them, or any aspect of them, who had been immolating the paintings. 

They seemed to be entirely unperturbed by the Dr.'s nonconsensual sedation, or indeed anything at all; which in and of itself was an alarming evolution of their presentation. They appeared to have attained some state of egoic dissolution the likes of which the Dr. had never seen, even in all the swathes of dissociative patients she had encountered, and even in her own system of Selves as she had come to know it, through her watercolours painted over the years of coming to terms with her own pathology and dissociative states. The Professor had learned something while under, and she desperately needed to find out what it was; what was it that she had missed in all The Device's output sequences, that she could put down into some manageable, digestible publication; so that all of this might be worth something, and that this worth may at least in part, be attributed to her. Or at least the her that was now fronting. 

This interaction, in which they asserted innocence, the lack of retaliation, the lack of mirror to the Dr's abominable wrongdoings, was the final thing they would communicate to Dot Code, and the insectoid creaks and snaps of their teeth, the final sound to ever leave their mouth.
