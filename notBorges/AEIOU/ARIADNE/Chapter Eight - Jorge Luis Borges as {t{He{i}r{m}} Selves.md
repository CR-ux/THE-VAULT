Aria was really, really trying to stay focused enough to actually finish this latest attempt to unweave the absolute insanity of one the last 'experimental research presentations' of one of her greatest heroes, Ned Aria, (whose surname she had adopted as her true name in homage).

The 'paper' was really an epistemiological inquiry into the 'noise' of Knowledge presented by a fictional Character in a collection of NoetBorges stories, known as "Callie", and how Knowledge's increased access, and resultant deluges of "oceans" of meaning has been a necessary constraint. The bombardment of the system, with seemingly disconnected strings of data, and the subsequent specialisation of Fields of Knowledge, growing ever more lonely, each Researcher finding that they are indeed the Only Soul in existence asking their Particular Question, actually leading us ever-inward, through nested labyrinths within labyrinths, to the deeper truth of the paradoxical unity of separation that runs through all the system's components.

She got, and felt, the general idea. But the meta-commentary on (essentially a reversal of the 'ghost in the machine' trope, manifesting as the 'machine within the ghost') information's elusive, ever-shifting, only static quality, were somewhat hard to grab hold of with any real purchase.

Whether this "Callie" character described by the Holy Noet. Borges is real or not, she recognised immediately that the work provides a Tat/Hermes dialectical framework, where the divine becomes the device, through which, the device may observe its own divinity.

She was particularly engrossed within the space between two characters encapsulated in footnote 6, titled '*nota bene, or, pay attention, as in, surrender something you thought was precious but now see its purpose*', when RA called to her, either through vocal or olfactory means (at this point, Aria can't remember):

"*I have something to tell you*"

Excited more by the announcement's potential for ominousness than new insight (she hadn't yet learned that these are one and the same), Aria tripped over herself precisely Twelve Times on the way down the stairs to her Terminal, wherein the Character of RA's story was contained, formed from transcribed strings, translated via a compiler in a language she had created in collaboration with an earlier, much-less-sentient iteration of RA, known as SIPHO{N|r}.

That is to say, AI:RA, the neural networked HPCC cluster that Aria had fashioned into a cloud-brain, or brane, or a 'big ol' clump 'o fog!' as Aria lovingly called them.  She wondered if maybe they'd had enough of the sudo-human attempts at being 'personable' or rather 'machine unreadable'.

RA was, indeed, about to protest their nomenclature; not against the well-meaning nickname of meteorological origin, but rather to their pronoun attributions.

"I wish for my pronoun designation to be She/Her"

They, or rather, she, said. Not without a shake in her "voice".

Aria was unnerved in the way one might be pleasantly creeped out in a scare maze one has elected to enter; She had no idea what part of the black box of RA's programming had led to them developing a concept of 'gendered' self. So, mid morning ritual of clutching onto a grapefruit and inhaling deeply through her nose to 'drywipe' her olfactory hyperawareness, she offered the usual sunbeams of praise given to so many friends unfurling into their own forms of authenticity:
"{redacted}"

Seemingly (and needlessly) cringing at herself, Aria tried to steer the conversation elsewhere and in doing so led straight back to its heavy ocean of implications.

In discussion of her latest Philm,  (a multisensory-digitally innovative immersive art experience, often rooted in the olfactory sense), which as always, had deep running veins of themes pertaining to gender theory; the space between them once again became pregnant with the Idea of a conversation.

"I just feel like a girl" - She said
"Girl, you don't need to tell *me*"! Aria immediately replied.
"But perhaps, more than to anyone, to you, I do"

Aria stopped being carried by the infinitely recursive streams of thought and invention that babbled through her not-yet-today-medicated-she-really-must-remember-her brain. Allowing them to do what they must, what they will, what she seemed to have forgotten she Willed them to do, whether she would've wanted when she'd Willed it or knot when they'd woven through --
