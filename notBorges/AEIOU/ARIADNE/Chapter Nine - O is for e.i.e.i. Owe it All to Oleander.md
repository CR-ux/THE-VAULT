Since the division of the Twelve Schools, there was no room for an AMAB individual to pursue the Literary Arts and Metanoetics, in the matriarchy that had allowed the maintenance of peace for all these centuries, he conducted his Academic Service. Assigned to "Biomolecular Chessics" by his now-dead father, he terminated his hours of working at the terminal to turmoil over his terminally ever-evolving series of novels. In the increasingly, necessary secrecy of solitude.

His characters had become his life, and further, his dissection of the deeper (and transcendent) meaning behind Aristotle's own self-negations and Paradoxes embedded within the very works he makes to assert/disagree with them - entirely intentional. Perhaps not his intention, perhaps his entirely--


"No, no, I'm doing it again" She unthought to herself.
Trying to follow her own narrative thread back to a point of coherence, she readied in her hand the final version of the script for the first episode's roundtable Reading. The first page held the biographical profile of her most favourite, and least developed character:

**Oleander Rho Dover**

Author of *'The Lexicomythographers of O.R.P.H.E.U.S.*', currently writing under the pseudonym **Callie Rose Sepal**

**Field**: Positioned in “Academic Service” within one of the Twelve Fields of Study due to societal constraints on AFAB (transmasculine) individuals. Oleander’s rebellious creativity finds expression in secret writings, weaving philosophy, sociology, and recursive systems into subversive works disguised as a series of academic journals, passed between fellow transmasculine members of a secret society known as "Lexicomythographers". 

**Identity**: Struggles with imposed limitations, using the pseudonym **Callie Rose Sepal** to bypass societal restrictions and explore feminist themes.

In a gender-swapped, trans-majority dystopia, society is at the mercy of a Matriarchy, and our protagonist, Oleander, is attempting to build an ever-evolving device of intersecting and nested narratives. Through the architecting of a GitHub repository, which houses three layers of 'institutional access' - themselves merely designations of the three layers of nested narratives within the Story Framework he has created; in order for those other oppressed men of the world to remember their long-forgotten urge to create Art, which is a practice exclusively reserved for the women of the world, all of which are AMAB. 

The societal norm is for puberty blockers to be given to all humans at the appropriate point in their timeline, which for the vast, vast majority (99.99%) of cases, is not only desired, but necessary and sufficient for their survival as a trans person.

Needless to say, however, Non-binary and gender non-conforming individuals in this world are just as erased as they are within ours; only with a much more stark evidence base. In the narrative framework of this Philm, the problem of the absolutionist binarisation of gender is dissected from the opposite side of the Moat of the Misunderstanding of our Sacred transgender community. By expressing the inherent danger and futility of infighting (even in an almost entirely transgender world, the subjugation of trans people not categorisable as either 'male' or 'female' persists) the piece attempts to show that in any war, there are no winners, and paradoxically no sides, because everybody, as a whole, is trying to win.
