    	Clara was busying herself as usual at her desk in the Library, when suddenly she became aware that she was a character in a series of books, designed as a series of letters, written, and rewritten, between characters in stories of stories upon stories of towers of Turrets of castling Libraries of Babel. 
    	
    	The realisation was earth-shattering yet inevitable, like any metaphor describing such a feeling might emulate a simile attempting the same function.
    	
    	She knew, now, suddenly, as one might be inexplicably be made aware of context in a dream (which, within its own context of lucidity, we go along with), knew the very Title of the Works within which she was a central character:
    	*The Lexicomythographers of O.R.P.H.E.U.S* by some "Oleander Rho Dover", which certainly didn't roll back the years of trying -
    
    
    
    
    *Oleander scribbled out his name, *quickly, quickly. What you are about to do-**
    *Replacing it with the much safer, though much less authentic, pseudonym:* 
    	*-*Callie Rose Sepal**
    
    Since the division of the Twelve Schools, there was no room for an AMAB individual to pursue the Literary Arts and Metanoetics, in the matriarchy that had allowed the maintenance of peace for all these centuries, he conducted his Academic Service . Assigned to "Biomolecular Chessics" by his now-dead father, he terminated his hours of working at the terminal to turmoil over his terminally ever-evolving series of novels. In the increasingly, necessary secrecy of solitude.
    
    His characters had become his life, and further, his dissection of the deeper (and transcendent) meaning behind Aristotle's own self-negations and Paradoxes embedded within the very works he makes to assert/disagree with them - entirely intentional. Perhaps not his intention, perhaps his entirely 
    

"No, no, I'm doing it again" She unthought to herself.
Trying to follow her own narrative thread back to a point of coherence, she readied in her hand the final version of the script for the first episode's roundtable Reading. The first page held the biographical profile of her least favourite, and least developed character:

**Oleander Rho Dover**

Author of *'The Lexicomythographers of O.R.P.H.E.U.S.*', currently writing under the pseudonym **Callie Rose Sepal**

**Field**: Positioned in “Academic Service” within one of the Twelve Fields of Study due to societal constraints on AMAB individuals. Oleander’s rebellious creativity finds expression in secret writings, weaving philosophy, sociology, and recursive systems into subversive works.

**Identity**: Struggles with imposed limitations, using the pseudonym **Callie Rose Sepal** to bypass societal restrictions and explore feminist themes.
