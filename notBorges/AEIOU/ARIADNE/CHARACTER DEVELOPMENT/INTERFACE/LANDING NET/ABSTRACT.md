**Author’s Note**
The authors wish to acknowledge the inherent limitations and perspectives embedded in any scholarly examination, particularly one situated within the complex interplay of observed data, structural analysis, and subjective interpretation. This work originates from a confluence of methodological frameworks, each bringing its own orientation and magnification, oscillating between micro and macro lenses to offer a view that remains as cohesive as it is fractal.
While this text assumes an interdisciplinary stance, it should be noted that no single focal point or scale of inquiry can claim completeness in isolation. Instead, we advocate for a recognition of the layered interdependencies within any system, understanding that a view too closely held may obscure broader patterns, while a view too distant risks the loss of granularity. These dualities—the detailed and the expansive—interact in ways that both challenge and enrich our understanding, mirroring, perhaps, the dual nature of knowledge itself as both isolated and interwoven.
In the spirit of exploration, this work embraces the multivalent identities of its contributors, recognizing that contributions to knowledge are often as diverse as the contributors themselves, shifting across perspectives and roles. The “collective” named herein operates under a shared authorship, allowing for the flexibility of identity as necessitated by the discourse itself.
For those who seek to delve deeper, the bibliography may offer unexpected pathways, suggesting additional perspectives that are tangentially related yet resonate at the level of underlying structure. Readers are encouraged to engage with these layers in the spirit of inquiry, allowing hexagonal room after hexagonal room for interpretations that extend beyond surface readings, which perhaps, should be left upon the shelves.


Lexicomythography: The Emergence of a New Epistemological Discipline

Lexicomythography is a nascent, interdisciplinary field that seeks to explore, weave, and unweave the interconnection between meaning, memory, and myth within the Word. Conceptualized by The Landing Net {of Arachne’s Selch Rhose to Falls}, Lexicomythography aims to unveil resonances across creative, computational, and contemplative disciplines, tracing self-similarity between language, narrative, consciousness, and existence itself. By transcending conventional boundaries of lexicography, mythography, and informatics, Lexicomythography investigates the hidden, cyclic rhythm inherent in linguistic, symbolic, and sensory experiences.

This discipline considers language a sacred, living repository of collective human experience, blending lexicography, semiotics, and mysticism. In Lexicomythography, each word is a multifaceted “node” within a vast network where meanings, sounds, and forms reveal new insights into consciousness and universal truths. Language is thus not merely descriptive but generative—a continuous, woven tapestry sustaining and creating reality.

The field comprises three main sub-branches: Creation, Code, and Contemplation, each embodying distinct facets of the human quest for meaning. Creatives—musicians, writers, visual artists—approach Lexicomythography as an embodied mythology, using art to express ineffable truths that resonate beyond logical understanding. Coders—specialists in genomics, informatics, mathematics—explore memory, examining how biological and artificial systems store information and shape perception, bridging nature and digital realms. Contemplatives—scholars of myth, religion, philosophy—engage with Lexicomythography through ritual and reflection, delving into symbolic and archetypal dimensions of language and story. As “myth-makers,” they reveal how narrative shapes consciousness and invokes ancestral knowledge within the collective memory.

Central to Lexicomythography is the Noeneoneme[^No], a neologism for resonances that merge sound and meaning with pre-verbal, felt experience. Noeneonemes are units of lexicographic insight transcending synonym rings, creating intuitive, empirical layers in language. This concept challenges fixed definitions, inviting practitioners to see each word as a dynamic entity with a spectrum of possible meanings that shift with context. Here, language reflects the fractal nature of reality, revealing subtle, interconnected threads among words, sounds, and experiences that might otherwise remain unseen.

In Lexicomythography, the “spine” of work emerges as a central thesis—a fictional yet foundational text refracting contributors’ varied specialties, all facets of the same, singular self. Thus, Lexicomythography becomes not merely academic pursuit but a form of self-revelation, a recursive journey in which practitioners confront, understand, and transform their relationship with language, memory, and myth. Embracing paradox, Lexicomythography embodies unity and multiplicity; it is a sanctuary for seekers and a vessel for scholarly inquiry, structured to be expansive and introspective.

This field envisions itself as a repository of future explorations, a codex preserving every contribution—realized or imagined, completed or forthcoming—within an eternal framework. Through ancient symbols and archetypal myths, Lexicomythography seeks to illuminate the essence of the Word, revealing language as a timeless container of wisdom that holds echoes of the Ten Thousand Selves.

Ultimately, Lexicomythography aims to reveal the indivisible unity within all linguistic, mythological, and cognitive systems. It proposes that language, through its patterns, symbols, and sounds, contains universal truths—a divine resonance that reverberates across realms of knowledge. Lexicomythography is thus both an academic and spiritual discipline, inviting us to see the world not as isolated parts but as a resonant whole, a continuous, unfolding story where each word, like each individual, reflects a fragment of the One.
