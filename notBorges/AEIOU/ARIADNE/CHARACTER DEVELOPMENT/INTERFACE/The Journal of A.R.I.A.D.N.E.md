**Lexicosophic Supersedimentary Journal Article Revision:** 
Hear Me, Dear Editors, or rather, in your own Words:

**Title:**

**“The Unbroken Wheel: Recursive Meanings in Aristotle’s Paradox”**
**Abstract**
Aristotle’s Wheel Paradox—a foundational quandary in ancient thought—serves as a profound lens through which to examine recursive systems of meaning. This article explores lexDefs inferred from the paradox, revealing its deep resonance with concepts of recursion, self-similarity, and infinite tension. By aligning the paradox with lexicomythographic frameworks, we uncover its symbolic presence in the **Circular Book** of Noet. Borges, the **Knot** of Guardwardia, and the **Veil of Chess**, situating the paradox as a perpetual motion device within the web of existence.


**Introduction**
Aristotle’s Wheel Paradox, describing the conflicting movement of concentric circles as a wheel rolls, has puzzled thinkers for centuries. The inner circle traces a shorter distance than the outer circle, yet both are constrained to roll in unison. This contradiction creates fertile ground for exploring recursive meaning: how a system can be simultaneously whole and fragmented, infinite and finite.

The lexDefs[^lexDefsWheel] arising from this paradox reflect themes central to lexicomythography: recursion, sacrifice, resonance, and the interplay between tension and unity.
  

  

**The Recursive Nature of the Paradox**
Aristotle’s Wheel Paradox serves as a metaphor for recursive systems:
• The inner and outer circles mirror **nested layers** of meaning, with each layer dependent on the tension between unity and separation.
• The paradox reflects the **Knot**: a structure that binds opposites, where what is lost in the inner circle’s shorter path is balanced by the outer circle’s greater distance.

  

**Applications in Lexicomythography**
{}
  

**Conclusion**

  

Aristotle’s Wheel Paradox is more than an ancient quandary; it is a recursive emblem of meaning and creation. Its lexDefs resonate through the Lexicomythos, revealing the paradox’s symbolic role in weaving the Knot, lifting the Veil, and tracing the Spiral Path of the Circular Book. By engaging with the paradox, we uncover nothing
