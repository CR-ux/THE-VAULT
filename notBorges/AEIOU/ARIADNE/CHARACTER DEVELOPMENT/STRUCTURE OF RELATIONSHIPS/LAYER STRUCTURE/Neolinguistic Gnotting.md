**Neolinguistic Gnotting: “Curse if Wreak, Curse if Reverse”**

**ABSTRACT**

THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE CONCEPT OF **NEOLINGUISTIC GNOTTING**, WHERE LANGUAGE FUNCTIONS AS BOTH A THREAD (CLEW) AND A FILTER (SIEVE), EMBODYING RECURSIVE PARADOXES OF CREATION, DESTRUCTION, AND MEANING. THROUGH THE LENS OF THE PHRASE “CURSE IF WREAK, CURSE IF REVERSE,” WE INVESTIGATE THE INTERPLAY OF LINGUISTIC RECURSION, SELF-REFERENTIAL SYSTEMS, AND THE METAPHYSICAL IMPLICATIONS OF UNRAVELING AND REWINDING MEANING. DRAWING ON ARIADNE’S MYTH, BORGES’ RECURSIVE LABYRINTHS, AND POST-STRUCTURALIST LINGUISTICS, THE STUDY POSITS THAT LANGUAGE ITSELF IS A “KNOT”—SIMULTANEOUSLY BINDING AND UNRAVELING, THREADING NEW PATHWAYS THROUGH THE VEIL OF COMPREHENSION.

**Introduction**
---


Language is both a **clew**, guiding through the labyrinth of thought, and a **sieve**, filtering meaning through layers of interpretation. In this duality lies the recursive paradox of **Neolinguistic Gnotting**, where every act of language ties a knot of meaning that must later be untangled. The phrase “Curse if wreak, curse if reverse” captures the tension inherent in this process: to create (wreak) is to curse oneself with the burden of meaning, while to reverse or untangle is to risk dismantling the structure entirely.

  

**RE: Clew--Sieve: The Neolinguistic Gnot**

1. **Clew: The Guiding Thread**
• _Mythic Roots_: Ariadne’s thread as a metaphor for linguistic guidance through chaos.
	• _Function_: Language as a tool for connection, clarity, and progression.
	1. **Sieve: The Filtering Process**
		• _Symbolism_: The sieve separates meaning from noise, refining understanding.
			• _Tension_: The sieve introduces gaps and absences, essential for the creation of new meaning.
	1. **The Knot**
			• _Dual Function_: The knot binds clew and sieve, creation and destruction.
				• _R_ecursive Nature_: Each knot is a moment of synthesis, 
					_equiring unraveling to progress further.
  

**The Burden of Creation**

1. **Curse if Wreak**
	• _The Creative Burden_: Every linguistic act is an act of cursing—imposing structure on chaos, burdening the creator with the weight of maintaining coherence.
		• _Examples_: Literary works that demand perpetual reinterpretation (e.g., Borges’ _The Library of Babel_).
1. **Curse if Reverse**
	• _The Destructive Risk_: To reverse or untangle a linguistic knot is to risk erasing the meaning entirely, exposing the void beneath.
		• _Applications_: Deconstructionism as a mode of reversing language, revealing its inherent instability.
  

**RE:Cursive Neolinguistic Newsomnian Systems**

1. **Neolinguistic Gnotting**
• _Definition_: The recursive tying and untying of linguistic knots to generate meaning.
• _Functionality_: Language as a self-referential system that evolves through recursive iteration.
2. **Burden|Boon in Iterative Newsomnian Studies**
• _Paradox_: Recursion amplifies both the creative and destructive potentials of language.
• _Symbolism_: The act of recursion as both a blessing (beautiful angellically delivered Harp songs) and a curse (the pain that led you both into and out of the practice of composing such heart wrenching songs).
  

**Applications in Lexicomythography**


1. **Symbolic Systems**
	• Tarot cards: Each card reversed reflects the “curse” of unraveling established meaning.
	• Mythology: Recursion in creation myths, where gods create the world by binding chaos and face destruction when unraveling it.
1. **Quantum Metaphors**
	• _Wave-Particle Duality_: Language functions as both a wave (potential meaning) and a particle (fixed interpretation), collapsing into knots upon observation.
1. **Art and Literature**
	• Joanna Newsom’s recursive lyrics as an example of clew-sieve dynamics.
	• Borges’ labyrinths as knots of narrative and thought.

Conch Loosen:

*“Curse if wreak, curse if reverse” encapsulates the essence of Neolinguistic Gnotting: language as a recursive knot that both binds and unravels meaning. The clew-sieve dynamic reveals the paradoxical nature of linguistic creation, where every act of synthesis demands eventual deconstruction. In this tension lies the transformative power of language—its ability to weave, unweave, and reweave the fabric of understanding. To embrace the curse is to engage with the recursive dance of language, a process that forever shapes and reshapes the labyrinth of meaning.*
