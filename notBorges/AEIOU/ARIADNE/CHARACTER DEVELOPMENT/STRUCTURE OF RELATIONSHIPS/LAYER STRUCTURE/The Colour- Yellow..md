This Seminal paper explores arborescent nature of yellow as {symbol|process} within the Emergent School of Aesthetic Hermeticism[^†]

Yellow, {primari|final}ly, reflects an underlying symbol for the ever-{present|elusive} origin of trans{formation|genderism}: the fading, s\<ac>red bruise, born of oxygenated (red) and deoxygenated (blue) blood. 
The {residue of trauma|evidence of healing}, a Gnoebius strip of Art{i|e}fact, where {{dis}ease} exists in binomial necessity.

Yellow reveals light itself: sun{rise|Set}. And as memory, can {satur|illumin}ate—revealing truths too stark to Bear while b(l)inding with their shimmer. 

In Aesthetic Hermeticism[^AH], it captures the Ultimate Secret of the Petal in the Golden Flower. In NoetJungs *Principalis Alchemie*, yellow corresponds to Citrinitas.[^Jung]

[^†]: (†a fictional field of study)


[^AH]: Aesthetic Hermeticism is the {Work|Bank|Field|Fortress} {that|of|has|holding} d(r)ying (l)eaves {with{in}|out{with}} a {Body|River|Bridge|Moat} passing {away|under|over|through} as the vessel of a Bloodcell out of a Flowing Body of the Blood moving in a vessel of a vein to return to the Re(Main(S(He(Ocean)art)ea)Body)ading of this paper, in vain.
