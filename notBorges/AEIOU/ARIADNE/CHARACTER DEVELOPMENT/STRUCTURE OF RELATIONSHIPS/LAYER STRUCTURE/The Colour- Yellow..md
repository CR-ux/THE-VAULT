## **ABSTRACT**[^ABSTRACT]

**The Lexicomythographical Contexts of the Colour Yellow: Through the Looking Glass of Aesthetic Hermeticism**

***By S. Elk and M. Endive***

This Seminal paper explores the dual, arborescent nature of **yellow** as both symbol and process within the framework of **Aesthetic Hermeticism**[^†], a field synthesising literary recursion, alchemical thought, and Goethean chromatic theory.
Anchored in the mirrored Lexicomythographical contexts of the 'Yellow Land', (as discussed in 'The Loving Portmanteau, JoJo's' collection of seminal Works: *The Yellow Land Line Telephone*[^jj]) —a desert plane representing the subconscious—we examine yellow’s role as a threshold colour, signifying the dynamic dance of trauma and healing, illumination and blindness, and liminality within the creative process, aiming to, as always, remain within the oneironeonymous framework of *A IS KNOT FOR AUGURY*.

Yellow, {primari|final}ly, reflects an underlying symbol for the intermediate, ever-{present|elusive} origin of trans{formation|genderism}: the fading, s\<ac>red bruise, born of oxygenated (red) and deoxygenated (blue) blood. 
It becomes the residue of trauma, and the evidence of healing, embodying a Gnobius strip of Art{i|e}fact, where {{dis}ease} exists in binomial necessity. In this way, yellow is not merely a hue but a cl(u){e{w}}- a thread to guide one from the labyrinth of pain, outward, into meaning.

{Converse|identical}ly, yellow reveals the paradoxical nature of light itself: **sun{rise|Set}, beginnings and {beginn|end}ings, {clar|obscur}ity. Light, as memory, can {satur|illumin}ate—revealing truths too stark to Bear while b(l)inding with their shimmer. Yellow thus becomes the veil, a Moat bridging the visible Library and the unseen Tundra, the known and the unknowable.

In the Arcana, Yellow serves as the **alchemical backdrop** to initiation (The Fool), action (The Magician), and transcendence (The Sun). In **Aesthetic Hermeticism**[^AH], it captures the Golden Hour of liminality, and the Ultimate Secret of the Petal in the Golden Flower. The {Athanor|Alembic}. {Cruci|ally|ble}, In **alchemy**, this colour corresponds to **Citrinitas**,[^Jung] the penultimate stage of transformation, where illumination precedes integration.

The **Yellow Land Line Telephone**, a tritone-tined fork of recursive connection, embodies this duality as a narrative device. Both a symbol of memory’s tension and a tool of revelation, its ringing is the call of transformation, tethering characters and layers of meaning across the recursive structure of the **Lexicomythography**.

## METACOMMENTARY

*(lexDef{i|o} : a merging of ideas into one, a worn-out narrative device taking the form of itself, mise en abyme)*

* This paper, forming the **body {REDACTED} emerges as a bibliographic branch from {REDACTED} It unfolds into {REDACTED}[^io], where yellow’s aesthetic and hermetic contexts are woven into the calligraphic and musical symbology of Gordian Knotation, a microtonal scale Calligraphed by one {REDACTED} much later {REDACTED} by {REDACTED} art in Hospital, {REDACTED} trans-temporal insight into the series of performance of events, that would, necessarily, lead to {REDACTED}. This web of {REDACTED} the seed of {REDACTED}[^u], where {REDACTED}'s analysis develops through the lens of {REDACTED}'s dreaming in the colour palette itself. Together, these layers prehend the paradox of {REDACTED} darkness at the heart of creation.
  * The paper itself becomes a {REDACTED} node within {REDACTED} tethering the **aesthetic hermeneutics of yellow** to {REDACTED} Yellow Land Line Telephone, the dream of {REDACTED}. This {REDACTED} the infinite recursion of {REDACTED}.
    * This is absolutely not a didactic device {REDACTED} inherent necessity and paradoxical self-limiting nature of the initiated Academic Clergy of {REDACTED} thought, itself both open-source and hermetically {REDACTED}(via economical, sociopolitical, anthropological and elitist) '{REDACTED} Vaults', or 'Lochs' of {REDACTED} knowledge, to which All and No Body Alone holds a key.[^transcript]

[^ABSTRACT]: **Gain and Grain:** Gain is both boon (see lexDefÆ: Gift of the Goddess) and burden (see lexDefÆ: Sissy Fuss Smoulder | Cistitial Shoulder), like grain sifted through the sieve. What is kept nourishes; what is lost lingers in the wind. | **The Sieve and the Spiral:** The sieve whispers, “Not this,” yet what remains is transformed | Through separation, the grain becomes bread, the reed becomes song | **Then-Measure of Resonance:** Gain is amplitude—a crest upon the wave, fleeting yet profound for its transience | Grain is its resonance, scattered yet rooted in soil | **The Agonisingly Extra Intra-Ordinary Undulation of Again:** Again is the echo of gain, the spiral of recurrence | Each return amplifies, reshapes, and renews | The cycle is endless, the knot unbroken by any means of the Sword of Mind without its Stone of Meaning | The Sword Must Cleave The Shroud About The Stone Which is Not The Knot Which Binds It But The Opening By Which it Was Bound.[^bookbinding]

[^bookbinding]: **The Burden of Amplification:** To gain is to Bear Distortion; to Amplify is to Obscure. Yet, through the sieve’s noisy filter, clarity emerges.[^theFinalTruthInSnakeCase]

[^theFinalTruthInSnakeCase]: **theFinalTruth:**[^camelCase] Grain becomes bred, dying into Silent One, sustained by the Granular Unity.[^UnityHardware]
