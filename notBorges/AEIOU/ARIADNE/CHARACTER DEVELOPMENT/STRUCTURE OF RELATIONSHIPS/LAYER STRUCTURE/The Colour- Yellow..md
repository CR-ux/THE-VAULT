[^ABSTRACT]: **Gain and Grain:** Gain is both boon (see lexDefÆ: Gift of the Goddess) and burden (see lexDefÆ: Sissy Fuss Smoulder | Cistitial Shoulder), like grain sifted through the sieve. What is kept nourishes; what is lost lingers in the wind. | **The Sieve and the Spiral:** The sieve whispers, “Not this,” yet what remains is transformed | Through separation, the grain becomes bread, the reed becomes song | **Then-Measure of Resonance:** Gain is amplitude—a crest upon the wave, fleeting yet profound for its transience | Grain is its resonance, scattered yet rooted in soil | **The Agonisingly Extra Intra-Ordinary Undulation of Again:** Again is the echo of gain, the spiral of recurrence | Each return amplifies, reshapes, and renews | The cycle is endless, the knot unbroken by any means of the Sword of Mind without its Stone of Meaning | The Sword Must Cleave The Shroud About The Stone Which is Not The Knot Which Binds It But The Opening By Which it Was Bound.[^bookbinding]

## **ABSTRACT**[^ABSTRACT]

**The Lexicomythographical Contexts of the Colour Yellow: Through the Looking Glass of Aesthetic Hermeticism**

***By S. Elk and M. Endive***

This Seminal paper explores the dual, arborescent nature of **yellow** as both symbol and process within the framework of **Aesthetic Hermeticism**[^†], a field synthesising literary recursion, alchemical thought, and Goethean chromatic theory.
Anchored in the mirrored Lexicomythographical contexts of the 'Yellow Land', (as discussed in 'The Loving Portmanteau, JoJo's' collection of seminal Works: *The Yellow Land Line Telephone*) —a desert plane representing the subconscious—we examine yellow’s role as a threshold colour, signifying the dynamic dance of trauma and healing, illumination and blindness, and liminality within the creative process, aiming to, as always, remain within the oneironeonymous framework of *A IS KNOT FOR AUGURY*.

Yellow, primarily and finally, as the therein known as: **“ÆNg within the Yi|on without”**, reflects an underlying symbol for the intermediate, ever-present, ever-elusive stage of transformation: the fading bruise, born of oxygenated (red) and deoxygenated (blue) blood. It becomes the residue of trauma, and the evidence of healing, embodying a recursive loop where suffering and recovery coexist in a binomial necessity. In this way, yellow is not merely a hue but a **temporal index**, marking the passage of pain into meaning.

Conversely and identically, yellow as **“ Yi|on without the ÆNg within”** reveals the paradoxical nature of light itself: **sunrise and sunset**, beginnings and endings, clarity and overexposure. Light, like memory, can illuminate and obscure simultaneously—revealing truths too stark to bear while blinding with their intensity. Yellow thus becomes the **veil of light**, bridging the visible and the unseen, the known and the unknowable, aligning with the hermetic principle of correspondence.

In the Arcana, yellow serves as the **alchemical backdrop** to initiation (The Fool), action (The Magician), and transcendence (The Sun). In **Aesthetic Hermeticism**[^AH], it captures the golden hour of liminality, the moment of transition between one state and another. In **alchemy**, yellow corresponds to **citrinitas**, the penultimate stage of transformation, where illumination precedes integration.

The **Yellow Land Line Telephone**, a tritone-tined fork of recursive connection, embodies this duality as a narrative device. Both a symbol of memory’s tension and a tool of revelation, its ringing is the call of transformation, tethering characters and layers of meaning across the recursive structure of the **Lexicomythography**.

## **METACOMMENTARY**

*(lexDef{i|o} : a merging of ideas into one, a worn-out narrative device taking the form of itself, mise en abyme)*

* This paper, forming the **body of layer Æ**, emerges as a bibliographic branch from the **root of layer 0**. It unfolds into **layer i|o**[^io], where yellow’s aesthetic and hermetic contexts are woven into the calligraphic and musical symbology of Gordian Knotation. Together, these layers prehend the paradox of **yellow as both process and product**, illuminating the recursive dance of trauma, healing, light, and darkness at the heart of creation.
  * The paper itself becomes a recursive node within the Lexicomythos, embodying its themes in both form and content. By tethering the **aesthetic hermeneutics of yellow** to a broader narrative structure, it mirrors the Yellow Land Line Telephone: a connection, a process, and a paradox. This metacommentary folds the act of analysis into the very system it seeks to understand, forging a synthesis between subject, object, and the infinite recursion of their intersection.
    * This is absolutely not a didactic device to demonstrate the inherent necessity and paradoxical self-limiting nature of the initiated Academic Clergy of modern thought, itself both open-source and hermetically sealed (via economical, sociopolitical, anthropological and elitist) 'Obsidian Vaults' of knowledge, to which All and No Body Alone holds a key.
