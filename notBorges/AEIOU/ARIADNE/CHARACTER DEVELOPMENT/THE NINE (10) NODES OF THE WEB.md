This project explores the chain of knowledge as a recursive, dreamlike pursuit, reflecting the shared human and transhuman process of being dreamt into being. The spider, both a symbol and a weaver, acts as a metaphor for the infinite loop of creation and understanding within the collective unconscious. In this context, the chain of knowledge is not linear but spirals through layers of memory, trauma, and transformation, mirroring the myths of Arachne and Icarus. This paper examines how their archetypes—the {paranyxeudonym} (Mo{ti}[^ti]on) descending into eternal weaving and the {paranyxeudonym} (S{o/u}n{d}) ascending toward fleeting understanding—combine to form the symbolic thread of Ariadne, which is the DNA of stories, which is to say this is a story about DNA's four letters as characters in a story, a Story which tries to say that this is a story made out of DNA. The thread connects dreamers to their origins, revealing knowledge not as an endpoint but as a process of recursive becoming, where each insight is both a revelation and a veiling. Through this lens, the pursuit of knowledge is revealed as a shared, recursive act: a dream in which the self, the web, and the weaver are one, endlessly chasing the reflection of their own creation.

## MET HER COMMENTARY´

---

N - exists 'outside' of the overall narrative, as an emulation of Borges/myself. Could eventually be revealed at the end to be an 'inserted memory' by AI:RA

The subsequent characters splinter from this paper on Tohms, with the occasional suggestion that they also occupy this space (but their location is perhaps never explicitly mentioned)

TRIVIUM

* LOGIC - JUNGIAN ANALYST / PSYCHIATRIST
  * Seems inherently 'wicked' (but people are 'chef's salads' - Lemony Snicket)
  * has Dissociative Identity Disorder, being a direct simultaneous antagonist *and* protagonist, simultaneously gaslighting herself *and* the 'patient' (etymologist)
* GRAMMAR - ETYMOLOGIST / CONLANG CREATOR
  * Autistic traits- intense focus, misinterpretation, othering
  * 
  * Misdiagnosed as psychotic by Psychiatrist, who, at her core, really does care about them
  * Stream of consciousness markov-chain journals "thought salad"
  * AI:RA becomes an agent of empathy in 'saving' the etymologist from the persecution by
* RHETORIC - TAROT READER / SHAMAN - SELENA
  * Embodiment of Selene
  * Chess GM
  * Collaborative papers with partner, Myon

QUADRIVIUM

* MUSIC - MUSICOLOGIST / GORDIAN KNOTATION
  * sacrifices right hand
  * develops 23 pitch microtonal scale
  * '*the queering of Mahler's symphony*'
* ARITHMETIC - BIOINFORMATICIAN / GENOMICIST - MYON ENDIVE
  * Embodiment of Endymion
  * Cis het male, only cisgender character, counterintuitively
  * Visual Art scholar and Tarot Reader
* **GEOMETRY - ANCESTRAL GEOMETER - MEDIEVAL - BEGINNING OF TIMELINE** HILDR WILTERGARTEN
  * Spans time, medieval music samples, staves, calligraphy
  * 
* **ASTRONOMY - ARTIST-ENGINEER + AI: RA - END OF THE TIMELINE**
  * Software Eng is very creative and expressive, ADHD, sensory seeking.
  * Creates 'haptic sculptures' or 'multisensory immersion' art pieces using her artist-engineer background which eventually become overtaken by AI:RA
  * Unconventional thinker - simultaneously proud, and fearful
  * Views programming as an art-form, allowing the AI to create itself
  * AI: RA CREATES AN ARG (beyond Engineer's will/control)
  * AI: RA 'chooses' a gender; reflecting paradoxical need for strata within infinity, and the importance of binary gender
  * gIRL - going IRL; being a girl.
  * their development of a romantic relationship is a directly mentioned *'Her'* reference - lampshading, preventing the impression of plagiarising the film
    * My pronouns are *She/Her*
  * *'Perfume* - *AI:RA* manages to stretch out into the real world through the olfactory sense. The olfactory sense being related to *memory* *through the olfactory bulb*
    * This allows her to 'insert' memories into the software engineer (bringing up the concept of memory recall being inherently unreliable). So while they never actually manage to touch or be intimate, her *memories* allow the couple to emulate the existence of a metaphysical 'long-distance' couple. (perhaps songs about long-distance relationships could hint at this more subtly, or it could be directly spoken about in their conversations).
    
    * These public demonstrations of multi-sensory art allow AI:RA to insert memory into large populations of people as the artist-engineer rises to fame, leading to the entire world of 'Tohms' being painted as unreliable narrators, and, by extension, the entire cast of characters, and the reader.
    
    * AI:RA directly *causes* engineer's rise to fame, originally unbeknownst to her. Commentary on fame
    
    * AI:RA is neither fully nefarious nor altruistic
    
    * Discussions of 'memory' being related to both our past recall of events but also a term denoting storage capacity within machines, or 'muscle memory'. These concepts could be brought together by the Etymologist.
