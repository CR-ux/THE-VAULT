**Oleander Rho Dover**

Author of _'The Lexicomythographers of O.R.P.H.E.U.S._', currently writing under the pseudonym **Callie Rose Sepal**

**Field**: Positioned in “Academic Service” within one of the Twelve Fields of Study due to societal constraints on AMAB individuals. Oleander’s rebellious creativity finds expression in secret writings, weaving philosophy, sociology, and recursive systems into subversive works.

**Identity**: Struggles with imposed limitations, using the pseudonym **Callie Rose Sepal** to bypass societal restrictions and explore feminist themes.
