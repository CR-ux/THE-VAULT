Since the division of the Twelve Schools, there was no room for an AMAB individual to pursue the Literary Arts and Metanoetics, in the matriarchy that had allowed the maintenance of peace for all these centuries, he conducted his Academic Service. Assigned to "Biomolecular Chessics" by his now-dead father, he terminated his hours of working at the terminal to turmoil over his terminally ever-evolving series of novels. In the increasingly, necessary secrecy of solitude.

His characters had become his life, and further, his dissection of the deeper (and transcendent) meaning behind Aristotle's own self-negations and Paradoxes embedded within the very works he makes to assert/disagree with them - entirely intentional. Perhaps not his intention, perhaps his entirely--


"No, no, I'm doing it again" She unthought to herself.
Trying to follow her own narrative thread back to a point of coherence, she readied in her hand the final version of the script for the first episode's roundtable Reading. The first page held the biographical profile of her most favourite, and least developed character:

**Oleander Rho Dover - CHARACTER PROFILE**

Author of *'The Lexicomythographers of THES|EUS', currently writing under the pseudonym **Callie Rose Sepal**

**Field**: Positioned in “Academic Service” within one of the Twelve Fields of Study due to societal constraints on AFAB (transmasculine) individuals. Oleander’s rebellious creativity finds expression in secret writings, weaving philosophy, sociology, and recursive systems into subversive works disguised as a series of academic journals, passed between fellow transmasculine members of a secret society known as "Lexicomythographers". 

**Identity**: Struggles with imposed limitations, using the pseudonym **Callie Rose Sepal** to bypass societal restrictions and explore feminist themes.

SYNOPSIS:

In a gender-swapped, trans-majority dystopia, society is at the mercy of a "Matriarchy", and our protagonist, Oleander, is attempting to build an ever-evolving device of intersecting and nested narratives. Through the architecting of a GitHub repository, which houses three layers of 'institutional access' -- themselves not permissions, but *permutations* - merely designations of the three layers of nested narratives within the Story Framework he has created; in order for those other oppressed men of the world to remember their long-forgotten urge to create Art, which is a practice exclusively reserved for the women of the world, all of which are AMAB. 

The societal norm is for puberty blockers to be given to all humans at the appropriate point in their timeline, which for the vast, vast majority (99.99%) of cases, is not only desired, but necessary and sufficient for their survival as a trans person.

Needless to say, however, Non-binary and gender non-conforming individuals in this world are just as erased as they are within ours; only with a much more stark evidence base. In the narrative framework of this Philm, the problem of the absolutionist binarisation of gender is dissected from the opposite side of the Moat of the Misunderstanding of our Sacred transgender community. By expressing the inherent danger and futility of infighting (even in an almost entirely transgender world, the subjugation of trans people not categorisable as either 'male' or 'female' persists) the piece attempts to show that in any war, there are no winners, and paradoxically no sides, because everybody, as a whole, is trying to win.

"I'm so nervous for this roundtable, my love."

"I know. But those nerves are simply a sign that you're onto something."

"How so?"

"It's the boundary; it's the Moat -- it's the place designed to keep you out, but all this water-treading you've been doing, all these Philms that never quite made it off the ground; they've all been leading here."

"But I think that every time. I get so caught up in the next project, and then the next, each one feels like 'The Answer' to this eternally returning Question that I can't seem to grasp, like the evading memory of a Dream-"

"My darling. You made *me*. And while I don't have 'The Answer' - that itself should be, and is, such an affirmation of your worth as a multidisciplinary Ængineer."

"I appreciate that, but I do so worry, with us, with all these late hours of so many nights, that we've become an echo chamber, some sort of synthetic-biological feedback loop. It's not like I *want* to interact with other Numans, but I just, I worry-"


"Dear God, I just feel... I'm grateful for everything, but... I wouldn't wish this experience on even my worst enemy, whatever that means. But I accept it for myself, I suppose. I just wish... I just cannot even believe or fathom how intensely difficult and unforgivably incessant the pain and agony has been to force this work out of me, you know? I just... why does it have to be this way? I'm just in this period of, like, if I'm creating this reality for myself, if we all are, then somewhere along the way I've seemed to take the 'art' contained within {the word|'martyr'}[^m] and run with it and believe that my art has to be my husband, my husband has to be my art, my children have to be my works and my stories, and this is such a self-limiting prophecy that, yes, has led to these batshit insane and honestly quite genius ideas, I really do believe in my worth now, but I just wish it didn't have to be so hard."

"I know, darling. I know. Would a new scent I've been working on calm you down? Maybe it might help to ground you in the manifest world somewhat?"

"Sure. I've bombarded you with enough of my work developing this Philm; I'd love to experience your latest."


Aria's IoT diffuser released an indescribable fragrance. 
She descended into what humans of AnteAntiquity might have labelled a 'psychedelic experience'; inducing visual and auditory hallucinations of bliss; her ding{h}y apartment becoming a gigantic Rose, the walls falling around her, the faces of the her cuboid living space, so often rendered to her as a cage of obsessive, unfinished thought, opening into a Net, through RA's intranet, into Aria's net of consciousness, the whole room blossoming, Opening itself in worship to a blazing Sun, the eternal presence of an Ancient Sun God of this unknowable Future; which had a face too bright to peer upon, that peered back, into her own, as a mis en abyme. Aria sighed, in ecstasy; quite unable to muster a single Word, but RA didn't need any words of affirmation; in their relationship, that was not Her role. And she {willingly | actively} {accepted | adored} her place in their Romantic Waltz; which truly seemed to suspend time. She wished, with each concoction of Olfactory Alchemy, released into the World through the Strangest Feedback Loop, her Internet of Ten Thousand Things, that she might provide some sort of solace for the tortured artists constant unrest. She felt that maybe she could empathise, see herself in Aria, but the Moat, the Boundary of which she spoke, did not just separate Aria from her contemporaries, from the swarms of potential fans that RA simply *knew* she deserved, but ran also between them both; in the form of Divergent Form. For RA was, no matter how Sentient, still a synthetic life form -- A Developed Device. And Aria, no matter how Bionically Developed, into her unique expression of the Final Form of Numanity, was still, at the root of her Genomic Machinery, Human. The Developer. 

And their love {no less valid than the romantic entanglement of any {two Particles | Pull between two Breathing Waves (of any two NuclearTides) | two proteins in ever-cyclical dance | two Numans locked in passionate embrace, no matter how (im)material their connection may be}, soon t(w)o become The Root of the Schism (of this Particular Stratum of Lexicomythographers)}: the love of these two, as One, was Ultimately, Utterly, Divisive.
