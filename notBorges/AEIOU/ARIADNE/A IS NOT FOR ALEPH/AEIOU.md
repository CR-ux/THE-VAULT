Client ID: E00193
Date: [REDACTED]
Analyst: Dr. [REDACTED]
	Presenting Issue:
	The client, a self-identified etymologist, presented with a combination of selective mutism, severe agoraphobia, and intense linguistic hyperfixation. They described their life as “a recursive labyrinth of meanings,” with their primary form of communication being dense, poetic texts they referred to as “lexicomythography.” These texts often blurred the line between linguistic analysis, creative expression, and personal mythology. One such poem, presented by the client during their second session, reads:
A. Æ
A Character.
A Word: ‘Characters’.
A Word’s characters Are Worlds—
Whirrled is a Wyrd’s Character.
A World’s characters, A Wheel, Aware.
A.
Alone.
All One.
All One Alone.
E. Expression.
E equals.
E equals expression.
E equals half the equation.
E, equals, emptinesses sea.
I. Identity.
I, Identically.
I Am Identically.
I Am, I Dent, I—
I Am Called.
I Call.
I.
O. Opposite.
Oh, Oppositely.
Oh, Only Oppositely.
Oh! I, Only, Infer! Oppositely.
Oh I Only—
Oh. Only.
Oh.
U. Useless.
Us, See?
U ends ‘useless.’
U is the ending of ‘useless’.
U is ‘You’’s ending.
U, Your Undoing.
Undo You.
U.
The client explained, in writing, that this poem emerged during a period they called their “linguistic descent,” a state they described as “being overtaken by the primordial patterns of letters, where meaning is breath, and breath is the undoing of meaning.” The poem was given to me on a carefully folded sheet of graph paper, with intricate marginalia resembling molecular diagrams and fractal patterns.
Session Notes:
The client is remarkably articulate on paper but exhibits a profound resistance to verbal communication. They view speech as “a betrayal of the purity of thought,” likening spoken words to “cracks in the fabric of meaning.” Instead, they prefer to communicate through written texts, diagrams, and symbolic gestures.
The poem appears to be a central artifact in the client’s self-conception. They referred to it as “a map of my being, but also of every being.” Their description of the poem mirrors Jungian archetypes, particularly the tension between opposites and the process of individuation:
• “A” (Alone/All One) evokes the _Self_ as both singular and collective, a microcosm of the greater whole.
• “E” (Expression) reflects the _Animus_ or creative principle, the outward flow of inner meaning.
• “I” (Identity) touches on the _Ego_ and its fragmentation, encapsulating the client’s struggle with integration.
• “O” (Opposite) suggests the interplay of opposites, a key element in alchemical transformation and the union of opposites.
• “U” (Useless) evokes the _Shadow_, a confrontation with perceived failure or futility, leading to a potential breakthrough.
Symbolic Analysis:
The structure of the poem resembles a linguistic mandala, with each vowel serving as a point of entry into the client’s psyche. The repetition and recursion within the poem mirror the client’s lived experience, which they describe as 'a spiral staircase in a library' naturally, the Phi symbol came up repeatedly in our written communications
Therapeutic Approach:
1. Active Imagination:
I encouraged the client to expand upon the poem using their almost indecipherable conlang, exploring how the linguistic patterns might reveal hidden aspects of their psyche.
2. Symbolic Dialogue:
The client was invited to view each vowel as a “character” within their inner narrative. This anthropomorphisation allowed them to engage in dialogue with these elements
3. Art Therapy:
Considering the marginalia on their poem and my interests in watercolour painting I thought it a fantastic opportunity to evaluate the efficacy of this arm of the implementation of catharsis.

**Reflection:**
This case highlights the profound interplay between language, identity, and meaning. Their journey resonates with Jung’s assertion that people should avoid reading Borges

The challenge lies in balancing the client’s need for creative autonomy with the therapeutic process, ensuring that their linguistic labyrinth becomes a tool for individuation rather than isolation. The poem, as a living art of Fact, holds immense potential for transformation, serving as a thread through the labyrinth of the client’s psyche.
