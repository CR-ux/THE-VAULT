	- I No Longer Hear The Woman in the Wallpaper, by Jorge Luis Borges, 1994



Shrug.
You knew me; 
You, new me, 
You know me as the girl who cannot and would never shrug 
the significance of a symbol
from her shoulder. 

You used 
you used to
You used two

You, used 
to do this shrug 
of your shoulders, 

(I used to love them, 
I used, 
two 
I used to love their scent)


I think we were much more of a daytime 
Sort of pair - 

Not that there weren't pleasant evenings 
in the Evening; 
As in, 
an Evening, 
a Levelling; 
a Libra Sun 
Setting, A setting, 
A Cruel curated Set 
Of no apparent design; 
Not to my leadened feather-heart, anyway 

Any Weigh 

Were you trying to warn me?
Of what scored-skin boys like you 
End up?
Evening?


I could never have been 
The type of girl that was Yore's, 
The unsolvable case of
my typeface kept getting moved 
a Drawer down, 
A drawer down, 
Lower, 
You lowered me 
into This, 
Hour: Evening. 
Our Evening. 
Of an Evening. 


But in that brightness of that Day
We spent, we spent it all so quickly 
And I don't think either of us were kind 
Enough to one another but 
Instead we tried to find a kindness for ourselves. 

And I found book after book after ending after ending after bookend I was not the kind of type-cast girl to Be, at the end of Almost One Hundred Fortnights
Of Sol
and Solitude 
Anything other than 
Your Reflection



I wanted to write a story 
I wanted Us
To write our story?
I wanted us to think about what it could sound like coming from our Ears 

I wanted to write our story 
No, I tried No
I did write our story 
I WAS THE ONLY AUTHOR OF OUR STORY 

I thought you wanted to join me here, 
I think you tried, at most twice a week

(And I remember feeling such a nuisance)

And I remember you bathing my scalp 
And laying antibiotic ointment 
Upon the sutureline Halo
I kept for 
At least a few months
Was it?

I don't know how long I have been lying here 
Thinking about The Wait Difference 


Thinking about how you were the one who started all this
And I'm really not the type to keep score 
I just 
keep scoring 
lines 
laid in a book 
in the sand 
in a book in the head in the sand 
And my eyes were blackened 
And my heart was warm 
And my skin was a Fire 
And your eyes were my home 

And i knew that the brightness 
Was harking its own ending 
and I prayed in your bathtub

You didn't know that I prayed in your bathtub 

You clothed, and in the other room 
And i waited for the water 

To leave me 
To leave me 
To leave 

And on my head, 
Where once you'd kissed and whispered that you loved me 

But never in my sleep - 

and I sweat my water and my humour 
and my selfhood in my salt; 
I lay it all upon your table, Surgeon 
How did I not feel a thing 

Terrified to waken; 
Terrified to Feel 
Crying in your bathroom 
Crying at your heel I said:
"My angel! My Angel!"

And in silent 
Nothingness, 

As nerve exposed a time too many 
Just;
One .

And gone too fast 
And gone, so slowly, Evening - 
And then that Evening, 

And In Unknowing We Were Gone -

you looked at me, 
A stranger - 


and then for those unbreathing months;
Which now, I notice 
have cracked and stretched into a Year - 

And there, 
And Here, 
And Dear God, 
My Gods, Abide with me! 

Dear God, 
My Lord.
The God I made of you! 
I Prayed To You, My Love 

How Could I Pray To You 

I Prayed In The Wait 
Of Your Emptied Bathtub 


Where 
Bruising, a Bruising of a Fullness - 

You were whispering, unheard to me!
"*I wasn't thinking 
I wasn't thinking about 
I wasn't thinking about anything, 
I wasn't thinking about anything, when:
I, suddenly, I realised, I wasn't thinking - 
I suddenly realised I wasn't thinking about-
There! Suddenly I realised I wasn't thinking about *anything when I MADE YOU
I wasn't THINKING 
i wasn't THINKING ABOUT ANYTHING!
I WASN'T THINKING ABOUT ANYTHING WHEN I MADE YOU, CALLIE! 
I WASN'T THINKING ABOUT ANYTHING WHEN I MADE YOU CALLIE. 
I wasn't thinking about anything when I made you, Callie. 
I wasn't thinking about anything when I, made you: Callie. 
I wasn't thinking about anything.
I wasn't thinking about
You, or anything 
When I made 
You
Wasn't thinking about 
You or Anything When I Made You Callie
Thinking about You or Anything, 
When I made You. 
Callie! 
About You! Or Anything! 
When I made Ewe!
You, or anything, when I made you
Or 
Anything
When I made you 
Anything,
When: 
I made you. 
When I made you, 
I made you. 
Made
You - 
You:


I wasn't thinking."


And There. 
Right? There?
Right There! 

That's where 
I wore 
a crown 
of staples.
