semantic (adj.)
"relating to significance or meaning," 1894, from French *sémantique*, applied by Michel Bréal (1883) to the psychology of language, from Greek *sēmantikos* "significant," from *sēmainein* "to show by sign, signify, point out, indicate by a sign," from *sēma*:
"sign,
mark,
token;
omen, portent; constellation; grave" (Doric sama), from PIE root *dheie-* "to see, look" (source also of Sanskrit dhyati "She meditates;" see zen). The word has tended to become loose in application. Semanticize "invest (something) with {meaning|*CHARACTER (Φ)*}; analyse semantically" is by 1942.
