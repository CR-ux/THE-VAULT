the album is incredibly chaotic, a caduceus in itself, One can barely latch onto a thread as a celtic plaited knot of hair cut off or three-headed serpentine cereberus guarding Nine Hellish Gates locked mess monstrous opus that keeps winding in and out, 
which is the point, 

noise music is a way to force the brain out of ego and into stillness 
silent awarenessÂ  
through 

paradox
