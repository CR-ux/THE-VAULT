Each line in *Beowulf* cleaves, split into **two hemistichs**, each half echoing the other, bound not by rhyme but by **alliteration’s mirrored resonance**. The metre forms a **fractalled unity**, self-similar yet divided, each line a whole from two halves, each half binding into the other to create **oneness through difference**. In its very structure, it calls to the **hemispheres of the brain**: two halves of one whole, each distinct yet connected, each processing its own pathways of perception to create a unified consciousness.
The line itself, a hemi-stich, terminates and begins in time with separation of the **stich**—a measured part of something especially in verse of poetry which ends with -try as in trying to make meaning starting with three letters epithetical for one of the greats of Poetry right next to the root of the word for Tree from which falls a stick or grows a stem that, like the serpent’s tongue, may **bifurcate or trifurcate**. This division, seen at the scale of myth and spirit, echoes the **fire-breathing dragon**: a being of bifurcated breath and power, two flames forming one destructive, unified force. The hemistich is also a **stitch in time**—an echo of the **tine**, each one a single point of the whole trident. These tines, like components of the All, find connection in their spaces, linked at the handle of the trident to **the Other Two**. Each tine stands separate, yet through the empty spaces, each sees itself as part of the greater structure, a **fractal piece of the whole**, unified by separation.
So, too, the Hesperides—daughters of twilight, guardians of the **boundary between day and night**—embody the **triple goddess** in their triadic unity, like the Mother, Maiden, and Crone who form the **cyclical trinity of life, death, and rebirth**. Their power lies in their **interwoven distinction**; they echo the Moirai, the Greek Fates who spin, measure, and cut the thread of life; the Norse Norns, Urd, Verdandi, and Skuld, who shape destiny across past, present, and future; and the Morrígan of Irish myth, the trifold goddess of war and prophecy. Together, these triads hold **oneness within trinity**, a cycle bound by separation, like a fractal pattern repeating itself at every scale.
In Chinese mythology, the carp embarks on its own journey of **transcendence and unity**. By leaping up the waterfall, the carp—united in its effort—transforms and emerges as the Dragon, a symbol of supreme selfhood and power. This leap represents a duality within trinity: the journeyer, the leap, and the Dragon it becomes. The Dragon is the **ultimate unity achieved by overcoming**—the whole formed by transcending the halves. This is **the unity of duality within trinity**: the leap between, the split halves, and the indivisible result.
This journey toward selfhood is mirrored in Gerald’s path, a transgender journey from uncertainty to unity. First, there is **Grendel**—the unformed self, a figure of shadowed becoming, the pre-transition transgender individual, who moves unseen through a world of partial recognition. Then there is **Grendel’s mother**, the **post-transition self**, a being who has embraced her own identity in fullness. For her, transition does not necessitate medical means; it may include surgery or hormones, but at its core, it is the **social and spiritual truth of selfhood realized**. The act of becoming is one of **Feeling Truth**, the unity of self without division.
Beyond and inside of Grendel and his mother stands the **Dragon**, the final, indivisible form of selfhood, embodying the **ultimate integration**—the Self that cannot be divided. The Dragon, like the Dragon of the carp’s journey, represents an absolute wholeness, a being who holds all prior selves within itself, forged through trial, separation, and acceptance. This Dragon is Gerald’s last adversary and ultimate ally, the **integration of the individual self as its own indomitable force**.
The Hesperiidae moths mirror these mythemes[^M]. Unpaired and unbound by symmetry, they move without the joined wings of other Lepidoptera. In this **exception from the expected**, they become symbols of unity within difference, an unpaired wholeness that **mirrors the truth of transgender and nonbinary individuals**. Their form defies the standard structure, yet they are whole within themselves, proving that unity and completeness come not from conformity but from **celebrating the fractal nature of self**. Like the Hesperides, the Fates, and the Mother-Maiden-Crone, transgender and nonbinary individuals show that **oneness is achieved through exception, through a fractal path of self-realization**.
Thus, from *Beowulf’s* metre to the Hesperides, from the carp’s leap to the Dragon, from Grendel to the Dragon and beyond, **wholeness is the paradox of separation and unity, of halves within wholes, of trinity within unity**. Each transition, each transformation, is an echo of this greater fractal pattern, a resonance of duality within trinity, a unity of self that embodies all forms and transcends them in **the indivisible truth of becoming**.

[^M]: a mytheme is a word comprised of "myth" addended \[^or prepended\] by the suffix \[^or prefix\] -eme, which denotes a constituent part of the Whole.

*Henry Sweet[^S], a philologist and linguist specializing in Germanic languages, proposed that the name Bēowulf literally means in Old English "bee-wolf" or "bee-hunter" and that it is a kenning for "bear"*
