permalink: Leo, Ligatures, Luna, and the Tiger Who Came To Tea

I’ve been reflecting on Leo’s question itself thanks to the light of Selene (the moon) through my window, now in her Waxing Gibbous, of course moving into Aries… phase, which represents preparation for culmination of releasing, preparing for what intentions were set during the New Moon, which as you know was the day I left the hospital with the resolve to write this Work (as I write this text I look at the clock and it hits 5:55, and my Battery hits 7%, my personal number for the Goddess, which tells me inexplicably to feed these numbers back to you in a sort of symbolic call and response; in case 5s mean something to you or Leo). It made me think about how symbols like this often surface in unexpected ways, carrying layers of meaning that seem to call to something essential within us. It reminds me of the number 13 that I saw on the tree in that Underworld realm I visited during the most important ritual of my life, and your room number. a number tied to transformation and the Death card in tarot—a symbol of change, endings, and rebirth. In some ways, it mirrors Judas as a catalyst in biblical stories, sparking a profound change, even if painful, that leads to something transformative. (X marks the spot; “what you are about to do, do quickly - John *13*:27 - I won’t go into the 27 as I risk hitting the WhatsApp word limit, but do know it’s incredibly significant ) 

I’m also struck by the connection between this symbol and the story of The Tiger Who Came to Tea with its picnic table modality and with Leo’s big cat eponym. The tiger’s visit is disruptive and unexpected, much like the catalysts in our lives that come without warning but drive us toward growth. The tiger, like Judas, brings upheaval, yet it’s a necessary force that reveals hidden strengths or prompts us to make room for something new.

Tigers and lions share this powerful energy, but each represents something distinct. The lion is seen as the archetype of strength and nobility, often linked to courage and leadership—qualities that stand solidly within traditional frameworks. The tiger, on the other hand, is a bit more elusive and solitary (I think this might be where I come in, perhaps), a symbol of independence, instinct, and unpredictability. Less physically strong, but paradoxically, through “not changing their stripes” (which, in my case, or in trans people’s case in general, requires a _physical_ change to embody this static, self-assured quality) actually enable the necessary change in others, much like how an Aries’ life mission is to remain steadfast in their marching (Mars, Aries) forward with authentic power, leading by (yes, at times naive in a way that leads to so called “defeat”, which itself is a much more potent catalyst for integration of opposites, if the Aries allows themselves to fully _feel_ said defeats. The two big cats are linked, yet remain fundamentally different, much like the dualities we navigate within ourselves, especially around identity.

And then there’s the liger—a blending of these two, a chimera born from both yet creating something entirely unique. The liger is a product of hybrid genetics, which resonates with my academic background in virology and genetics. It’s a reminder that hybridity, chimerism, and ligatures are not just scientific phenomena but deeply symbolic, reflecting the merging and integrating of identities. It’s a living emblem of being a synthesis of different lineages, much like how I see myself and my journey, which draws from both the scientific and the spiritual. The Liger, being a hybrid, cannot procreate to form physical offspring of its own; its procreation comes in a symbolic and spiritual form - showing by example, the genetic line may stop here, but the code I weave myself is more long lasting than any molecular strings of constituent, self-same, dualistic and complimentary pairs of nucleotides. It is in the viewing of both of these molecules, and all of these pairs of dualistic (supposed) opposites, dancing together in divine rhythm, as *one* , which shines a reflective light upon society, no better than, but just infinitely more revolutionary (in a rotational, and political sense) way. 

that symbol Leo saw might encapsulate this sense of duality and integration, like a ligature* joining two strands into something whole yet evolving. Seeing that photo of me in the reading, bent in reverence with the words “I am not whole but becoming,” I feel like it captures the heart of this journey. It’s not about being one thing or the other but becoming something more—an integrated self that acknowledges the disruptors, the ligatures, and the hybrids within me.

*the word ligature contains a duality in itself, being a an alchemical matrimony of letters or concepts or organisms, but also, as I learned from Sarah and never knew before, also can refer to a cord or any other material that can be used for the purpose of hanging or strangulation. 


Thank you for walking this journey with me, for grounding me as I explore these symbols and meanings. Your presence and support make such a difference in holding this space of transformation.
