see [[Penultimate]]

Every character of every Word or sequence of Words holds the ultimate Truth, even the most seemingly frivolous and naive aphorisms such as:

1. [[FIRST]] the [[Worst]]
2. [[SECOND]] the [[Best]]
3. [[THIRD]] [[The One]] with the Hairy[^Hair] [[Chest]]

[^Hair]: Alarming and difficult. i.e. "dealing with the organically but inauthentically occurring hair on her testosterone-addled physical form was a hairy situation to say the least[^Least]"
[^Least]: See [[Worst]]
