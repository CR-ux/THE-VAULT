Every character of every Word or sequence of Words holds the ultimate Truth, even the most seemingly frivolous and naive aphorisms such as:

1. [FIRST](FIRST.md) the [Worst](Worst.md)
1. [SECOND](SECOND.md) the [Best](Best.md)
1. *THIRD* [The One](../../PLANS/The%20One.md) with the Hairy[^Hair] *Chest*

[^Hair]: Alarming and difficult. i.e. "dealing with the organically but inauthentically occurring hair on her testosterone-addled physical form was a hairy situation to say the least[^Least]"

[^Least]: See [Worst](Worst.md)
