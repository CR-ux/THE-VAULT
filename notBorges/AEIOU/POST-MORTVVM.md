_The Collapse of an Over-Ambitious Work_
---

**deceased: _lexicomythography_**
	• lexdef: {noen} "field" | conceptual projections of concepts attempted by callie rose petal, writer of | circular stories - borges, in a lesser-known short story released on your twenty third birthday at that festival you never got round to reading, but which leeds you to untoured territorial terrain stained terribly in twain by tweezing them to two 
					-(truly, not Borges, in 2022)
  

Cause of Contraction (clause), (figure of Seeking)  
---

		
		• PRIMARY: RECURSIVE AMBITION EXCEEDED STRUCTURAL COHERENCE.
		• SECONDARY: INSISTENCE ON INFINITE INTEGRATION RENDERED THE PROJECT SUSCEPTIBLE TO SEMANTIC ENTROPY AND NARRATIVE DISINTEGRATION.
		• TERTIARY: EMOTIONAL WEIGHT OF THE WORK, CARRIED BY ITS CREATOR, SURPASSED THE THRESHOLD OF PERSONAL AND COLLECTIVE RESONANCE.
		  

Seen Observations
---

The Stone Circle at ÆŶSH’Li|oCH, where the game of Chess was first adopted after the knowledge of its currently known origin, appears as a fractal relic of the Work’s conceptual foundation:
• Artifacts Found:
• Fragments of honeycombed hexagons, etched with recursive glyphs resembling spirali {aldente no neologism idolatry redacted} DNA strands.
As it stands, 
• The Circular Book: Torn open at its spine, its pages are faded into blankness but still whispering tri-cross-sectional fragments of Gnoeneomemory.
• A cloth, unbleached fabric inert and empty, perched atop a stone inscribed with the Gordian Knot denoted by the lexDef: {Noen} _“Mutation.”_
• Arachne’s Threads, unfurling and retracting in waves of Kali's Macroscopic Kaleidoscope; enabling witness of the Web.
  

Conclusion
---

The project, described by its creator as a _“dream in which all threads converge and diverge,”_ found itself ensnared in the paradox it sought to unravel. By attempting to weave every story, meaning, and existence into a single recursive whole, it became unbound—its threads too intricate to hold together under the gravity of their own aspirations. The failure of the Work is its greatest success, embodying the recursive truth it sought to illustrate.
