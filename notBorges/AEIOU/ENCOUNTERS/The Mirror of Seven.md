*In the bothy*

At the 'now' of writing this text, I faced yet another darkness, deep and heavy in its dimension
My ceremonial candle extinguishes itself as I
At some unknown, far-stretching time in the past of a Self I know longer know but only carry with me; I drew this diagram

{REDACTED}

    *And the “7” in the background, hinting at “Goddess” in my now-developing mythos, (seven letters) - it is All (literally, the picture is of a 1 dimensional form taking 2 Dimensions, taking on 3 (cube) taking on 4(consciousness as cubic 3D sections, stretching out across time) 5 (consciousness to self I.e. metacognition, the 4D planes spiral back on themselves), 6(self to other, an un-illustratable concept of mise en abyme signified by two lotus flower buds with 6 petals of two 3s on each side, on the top and bottom points of the Oval (ovum, egg), mirror frame, encapsulating the system; and 7- the unreachable pleroma outside of, yet backgrounding, the Frame. The Wreath around the androgynous, integrated Seeker, Once, At Once, and At One with, The Fool, at the 'End' of the Path of the Major Arcana in the Tarot, Which, at the time of creating this image, I had no conscious knowledge of. The Truth of Seven; so obvious, hiding in plain sight - the biggest number in size, and yet, only once it’s pointed out, through these iterative self same processes, is it revealed*
    

It may have been Seven years ago, I think, writing the above interpretation to my Self

As I look at my phone, noticing a lag in its functionality due to a dwindling battery-

it hits 7%
