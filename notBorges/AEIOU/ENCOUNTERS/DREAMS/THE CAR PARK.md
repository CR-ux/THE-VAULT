THE CAR PARK DREAM

A woman from Mi5 pronounces on the news that people 'just love' to "send in" what she calls 'KSH's. I think nothing of it, knowing, somehow, within the dream logic already laid down somewhere Other, more foundational than the dream, its definition, as a siren call, or 'crying wolf' or warning of imminent death through a violent act of terrorism or torture. 

Visited by three spirits:

one member of the past I used to want, the man attached to which said goodbye on white walls, car doors and flipchart coloured beige wallpaper of the car park,, which I apparently called my home, forever, because I kept the man attached to said member, waiting in the car outside.[^1]

one of an unknown present I did not want, but had, but had never met in my waking life, him visiting some other room of this place to let his presence be known-

and one member of a known future passed that hadn't quite already happened, or maybe it did, in the attic of my sister's bedroom in our once childhood, now gone but still here, home; whom I had shielded a truth from, behind me, like the shield of Minerva in the painting [[notBorges/aria-dne/MARS FIGHTING MINERVA]]

[^1]: This man farewelled quite verbosely, through a series of messages in all-caps, scribed in a draining red dry-wipe ink of emptiness, hollow messages of wishing me luck, saying words I had not the time to read nor the will to put in the effort.
