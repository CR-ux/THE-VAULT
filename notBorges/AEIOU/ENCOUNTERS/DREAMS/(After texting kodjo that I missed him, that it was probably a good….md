# HUSK HAS CHANGED - 09.02.2022 

*[There is an insidious bitterness* 
*To coffee* 
*I mask every day with sugar* 
*That I tasted alone in Lisbon* 
*On a sunny balcony*
*With a sobering realisation* 
*That I taste now* 
*As my sugar has run out* 
*And I won’t go downstairs to buy more* 
*What a common, human thought it is*  
*To think* 
*What was I thinking?]*

After finally falling asleep rocked in a crib of the ocean of grief at 2:30am
I was in Husk, the Goya-esque Oak coloured space 
But it had changed -

The colour was now a shimmering grey, as if the tones themselves were more playful, like someone had blown life into them -
Barnie had a boyfriend they didn’t tell me about 
Called Rob, who I’d also slept with at some point and I thought was really cool
And I was like why didn’t you tell me honey? Barnie thought it wasn’t important that I know -
But then rob got really jealous when I jumped onto Barnie and wrapped my legs around them, giggling 
(Dreams that happen in Husk always involve jealousy of some kind, the locale of my dreams are more important than the events themselves) 
I stupidly made a joke about the word ‘rob’ meaning ‘theft’ 
And this made rob mad 
Eventually Rob wasn’t there anymore and it was just Borkie me and Sylv, and we went to their bed, their Glasgow bed but it was in Reyn (my dream underworld, which is the Freudian id, that looks like an Ernst painting, thick with dark green foliage, with a train that runs around the perimeter and takes me to Khopi (the Cornish landscape with a lighthouse and a winding train track around it with no supporting structure) then stops at Aoe-he (the place filled with ridiculously complicated rollercoasters), the train travelling through time, Each stop more futuristic and metallic and technological in appearance, each stop having a greater and greater population until Tyxos, the terminus, which is a GIANT metropolis on a far, far away planet with an inconceivably tall observation tower with a disc that spins and raises off the top, higher, higher, higher, above all the gigantic skyscrapers, but the train doesn’t go to Whjut, I am taken there against my will, and so often forget every dream that happens there, left with a horrible feeling upon waking that something catastrophically traumatic has happened, but I haven’t been taken there for months) 

and I asked to rest my head on Sylv’s chest, and she said ofc Callie, and the moment I did I turned into a black cat again, like I did that time in Reyn before I met Barnie, with the three men watching me outside a Cafe in the part of the space that resembles the novel Crime and Punishment, crawling along a slimy, cold and dark rocky floor, up some winding stairs

We woke up back in Husk, not knowing how we fell asleep, asking each other ‘did we even sleep?’ 
And suddenly we were backstage at one of my opera shows, I’d just walked behind the stage curtain and Borks sylv and kara were there, and we all drank blueberry jam and milk out of a giant baby bottle with an orange teet, knowing it had tranquillisers in it, but drinking it anyway, all of us passing out one by one except for me, watching them all fall asleep again, desperately wishing I could fall asleep too, knowing someone was coming to take us somewhere we weren’t allowed to see the journey to, wishing, wishing, wishing I would just pass out, looking at their sleeping faces, thinking please, let me pass out so I don’t have to see this man carry me away, so he doesn’t knock me out violently, please, let these tranquillisers hit me too, thinking, have I taken too many drugs in my life for this to hit me, terrified of what this man might look like, still hearing the crowd screaming for an encore - and then, instead of succumbing to unconsciousness, I woke up in my bed IRL, I wrote all of this down in a stream of consciousness  WhatsApp message to Barnie with a huge description of the dreamscape maps I’ve recorded in my notes (now copied in in parentheses), about how Dani wasn’t in Husk, even though this is HIS dreamspace, where I grew up. where I always dream about him, where I process everything he ever did to me and everything I ever did to him, where a giant and oppressive white statue used to stand, but he wasn’t there. The statue wasn’t there. It no longer resembled the place I grew up. Manuel, my ex-colleague and attacker wasn’t there, who normally is, somewhere, either trying to or succeeding to have sex with me, and I always enjoy it, waking up ashamed. Everything in Husk had changed for the better, everything was lighter in weight, and as I wrote the words ‘you have affected my subconscious’ in the text, my phone died, before I could write or formulate just how they have affected my subconscious,  losing so much detail and information which I probably needed to forget.
