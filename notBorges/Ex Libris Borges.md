"*Dear Nema, --*"


he began. 

Borges Was writing his final letter. He would go on to pen more, but <sup>not</sup>[^not] by [[The]] mechanism of his own fingers. His vision had dissolved to a faded yellow hue, which pervaded [[Everything]]. He knew this colour was the final vestige of his visual sense. 

[[notBorges/CRUCIBLE/A|A]] creeping red hexagon forming from the Blood of a Goat, or a scapegoat or a human scapegoat, or Six human scapegoats, or Six seeds of human cells, entering Metaphase; destined to each split into Two Commandments, to begin the infernal, interphasing Once. Again. 

Only, a sense of incompleteness, Five edges, promising a Sixth

He took a second, or a sixth of a second, to realise that the word 'Sixth' is the only word in the English language, the linguistic master's favourite language, which he still held as being the most full of romance - even if this particular author, whom Borges at this time may or may not have been aware of, did not agree. 

He was the Sixth edge, or rather the first edge, of a perimeter surrounding a circle. Or, a central hexagon small enough to appear as a circle. 

Borges knew it was time; or rather, it was always time, as a mirror. [^sw] [^p]

Once he was dead, or rather, his body was, and his blood formed the final edge of the Hexagonal sigil upon the inside wall/ceiling diagonal surface at the top right hand corner of his, that is, The Jorge Luis Borges to which I have ⁿᵒᵗ been narrating this story from the lens of the "I"[^I] of's Attic, 
Which was a coveted space by the revolutionary (context: heroic) writer, who would escape there with many a hardcover edition of Books of Stories of Exaggerations of Lives, and be the reader he was. A gargantuan weight of books, heavy enough to break all five bookshelves in an infinite library 
Any weigh --
Ne[^Ne] Weigh
This attic was to be broken into by a fellow member of his previously unstirred Society, a fellow Lexicomythographer, who was perhaps the truest fan of his work. 
This Society Member, as Borges, was a Noet; the highest position able to be held within the Lodge, that is, pre [[Lodge Ban]]. And so, ᴺᵒᵉᵗBorges and ᴺᵒᵉᵗNima considered themselves Contemporaries. But most of their creative partnership, which is to say all of it, which is to say the last Nine minutes it may have taken you to adjust your eyes to the cacophony of this Narrative Voice which may jarringly shift into second person to alert you of the seriousness of this situation, by demolishing what is stupidly, erroneously called the Fourth (it should be the Sixth[^6]) wall of this ᴺᵒᵗFictional Metanarrative Universe of Infinitely recursive and Fractalline Fable.[^o] 

ᴺᵒᵉᵗBorges knew that ᴺᵒᵉᵗNima would be breaking and entering his home, and so he made the necessary adjustments urgently, before he lost his precise vision to perform these imperative and delicate tasks of covert preparation. 

This was to ensure his beloved fellow ᴺᵒᵉᵗNima who he cherished so dearly, and whom he (unfortunately for him) was in a tragically polyamorous entanglement, not tragic for its polyamory, but tragic for his inherent inability to feel comfortable or sufficiently held by Eight People more than One. 
The other ᴺᵒᵉᵗs were equally held in romantic importance by ᴺᵒᵉᵗBorges. but before he lost his sight, and he had ensured his unrequited beloved's safety in her imminent crime against him, which he knew was, in her eyes, which is to say her eye, which is to say her "I" truly felt was the best for him, even though of course it was ⁿᵒᵗ. Not at all. 

Anyway, as "I" was saying, which is to say She, by whom I mean ᴺᵒᵉᵗNima, who is also known as The Woman in The Wallpaper denoted by a single Double You, which is to say the Single, Solitary Character Termed "Double You" and Denoted by the Letter to God, the unforced and Levitating Un-Syllable Breath of The Twenty Third of the Unhearable Pitches of the Gordian Knotation Microtonal Tuning and Magick System Also known as the "Alphabet", i.e. the constituent "W" (n.B.). [^nb] w hich really just means The Two of You, Together As  One. To Be. Or, knot: 2B; as in, a temporary[^s] method of scribing words[^sw]; or: Two Be, as in, Two Existing as One. Or, To Bee[^lex]

He grew, Older, 
Colder - [^w]
Unlike the unborn Sylvia[^s], he didn't need to ask why-

He knew why he was cold.[^cc]


Knowing this, there was a certain urgency, but decidedness to his movements. In the dark of his attic, our main character, the main character of every story, the writer, was finishing his final letter, of a sentence, of a final sentence, of a certain storied character. The letter, within a letter within a word within a letter, was the Twenty Fourth letter of the english alphabet. Which may also be used to denote a number, if one opts. This particular letter is also a symbol, perhaps one scrawled over labels of poison within pots, or for marking a location whose importance is of note, or, indeed, "The Spot".

X, as in, the middle letter of the word 'Sixth'; Ex, as in, a denotation of the now long gone but unforgotten past; 
X as in, [[The Letter]] of a certain [[CHARACTER (Φ)]][^C]


As in, the cross, 
as in, the sacrifice, 
as in, the rebirth
as in, a palindrome of two values, greater than the value they bookend, which is nothing.[^p] 

He looked at that almost-hexagon upon the wall, that open-and-irregular (due to its openness) pentagonal polygon, and took out his notebook, which itself resembled the shape of a hexagonal chess board. Which was itself a map: \<img src: knot found>

And so, he ended;
(Such endings are inevitable in the late hours of the night);

With a mirror:

*"Dear Nema -*
