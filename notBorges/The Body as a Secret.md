permalink: The Body as a Secret

The body is a secret 
The work must go unheard 

The body is a secret 
And lonely is the Word 

My body is a secret 
The One split into thirds


This body is a secret 
This body, old and colder 
My body, raped, 
A secret told
I mould her 

This body-



This body is a secret 
My work, dust-
knows no herd
