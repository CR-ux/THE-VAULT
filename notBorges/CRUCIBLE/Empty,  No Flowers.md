I ate 
All of the cutlery and plates 
I pray 
To not be a reprobate 
Salvation 
Is just a hair 
Pull 
Away 

Time to eat salads 
Time to eat salads 
And get myself in check 
Time to eat salads 
Be empty 
No flowers 


When I woke up not breathing 
And I started crying 
You held me so close to your body 
That my neck felt the heat from your face 
and you said to me 
You are safe here, now, Callie 
You are safe
