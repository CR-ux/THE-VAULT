Machine got picked up to be rebuilt after OS reinstall didn’t fix my blocker 
Hoping to get Security clearance application finished today 


Started going thru B and T confluence pages and starting to reference the repos 

Was working on spinning up a little Scala ref app I built while on leave in the evening along with making my way thru the opencast 

Got a shadowing call with Sandy at 11
