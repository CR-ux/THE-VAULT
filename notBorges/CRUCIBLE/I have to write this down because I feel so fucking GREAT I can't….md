I have had the most kismet-driven, serendipitous evening in Edinburgh 
The deposit money came through from my lab demonstrating (full circle) 
I saw a show 
five encounters on a site called Craigslist 
I read out aloud into the microphone on stage, all of the audiences previously written answers to the question "what's something you always wanted to say to someone, but never did?" Prefaced with the phrase "I just wanted to say that..." 
I sobbed like a child on that stage 
Choked up 
Choked up 
Looked down at the shivering pieces of paper 
And the astoundingly connected things they read 
Tears dropping to the taped black stage floor just as frequently
And Sam, who wrote this space 
Into which we all crawled and propagated our own love and acceptance 
Into which we may have suffocated and died but he brought us back and I think it's because (the moment we sat down) he told us to take off our shoes. 


I met you when you were 11 years old 
such small minds but an amazing soul 
coulda done so much but you did so much for 
i wonder where we’ll be when we’re 24 

And i wish this wouldn’t end 
and I will always be your friend 
And i will always be your home 
so you’re never alone = 
I want to take a beauty and the beast mirror 
and show it to the you that was walking home 
after having a really shit day at school 
I want to 


monogamy, gender, the right to bare arms
security, competence, unlucky charms 
 
music, vibration with relation to whoever chooses to hear constructed way back when we fucked it and decided to live based on fear 
of what little boxes don’t fit in our boxes and the boxes
