there is time, there will be time 
a river running out 
for auld lang syne 
in nothing but dust
and sandpaper rust 
with everything losing its shine 


 this time 
i promised myself 
to open wider at the centre 
let a little light in 
with time 

I am an unbearable child 
But I grow so old sometimes 
I only know that I am so disposed with woe 
riddled with the things that I don’t know 

and in time 
curtains drawn wide 
let go of the banister 
let all the light inside 


cast it down the stairs 

Illuminating blemishes 
to tell the secrets 
I wasn’t ready to share
