In this ignorance 
Learn you are a holy place 

In the midst of this emptiness 
Learn you are my sanctuary 

Turn away from my Self 
Towards a subtler greatness 

Turn away from you 
To show you that I love you 

Take sacrament in urine 
Burning bodies 

Longing to be touched 

In the filth of my own unholiness 
I learned the architecture of your arms 
Pulled Out from the bottom of my pit 
I sat for a while 
And prayed 
in the chapel contained within
