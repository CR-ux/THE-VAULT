I could never understand You 
But every day it becomes incrementally clearer 


There could be a recording function in the controller that plays back the player’s breath whenever the MC listens to the hum more closely (by holding a button)

Follow Heroine’s story - EACH NUMBER A LEVEL; each level Chiasmic in structure (narration MC - MC work - real life recordings - MC work - narration me) 

FIND REAL WORLD EVENTS THAT SEEM IMPLAUSIBLE BUT UPON RESEARCHING AUDIENCE SEES THEY HAVE HAPPENED 
- TRUE STORIES OF SUPERNATURAL, BECOMING MORE PLAUSIBLE UNTIL THE FINAL LEVELS ARE OBVIOUSLY EVENTS THAT HAVE HAPPENED IRL 

1. **HEROINE SEPARATES FROM THE FEMININE.** The “feminine” is often a mother/mentor figure or a societally prescribed feminine/marginalized/outsider role.
**WHEN I GOT COVID AND ALMOST DIED MY CONSCIOUSNESS SPLINTERED. THE SPLINTER IS THE MC. THEIR CONSCIOUSNESS TRAVELS TO A DIMENSION IN WHICH THEY WERE THE ONLY SURVIVOR  ON EARTH** 
1. **IDENTIFICATION WITH THE MASCULINE & GATHERING OF ALLIES .** The heroine embraces a new way of life. This often involves choosing a path that is different than the heroine’s prescribed societal role, gearing up to “fight” an organization/role/group that is limiting the heroine’s life options, or entering some masculine/dominant-identity defined sphere.

**SURVIVAL ALONE. PERHAPS BREAKING INTO SHOPS, HUNTING ANIMALS, NO “ALLIES” KNOWN TO THE MC BUT WE AS THE AUDIENCE ARE THEIR ALLIES**

1. **ROAD/TRIALS AND MEETING OGRES & DRAGONS.** The heroine encounters trials and meets people who try to dissuade the heroine from pursuing their chosen path, or who try to destroy the heroine.
**RUNNING OUT OF MEDS. OGRES & DRAGONS ARE HER OWN.** 
**MESSAGES IN THE HUM SEEM THREATENING AND ALIEN TO BEGIN WITH** 

1. **EXPERIENCING THE BOON OF SUCCESS.** The heroine overcomes the obstacles in their way. (This is typically where the hero’s journey ends.)

**ADJUSTMENT TO LACK OF MEDS. END OF WITHDRAWAL. UNDERSTANDING OF THE MESSAGES WITH MORE CLARITY. THE MESSAGES ARE TELLING THE MC’S FUTURE.**

1. **HEROINE AWAKENS TO FEELINGS OF SPIRITUAL ARIDITY/DEATH.** The heroine’s new way of life (attempting the masculine/dominant identity) is too limited. Their success in this new way of life is either temporary, illusory, shallow, or requires a betrayal of self over time.
**MC’S LIFE BECOMES MEANINGLESS AS THEY KNOW EVERYTHING THAT’S ABOUT TO HAPPEN, BUT DO NOT KNOW ABOUT WHERE THEY CAME FROM** 

1. **INITIATION & DESCENT TO THE GODDESS.** The heroine faces a crisis of some sort in which the new way of life is insufficient, and the heroine falls into despair. All of the masculine/dominant-group strategies have failed them.
**RUNNING OUT OF HORMONES** 
**LOSS OF CREATIVE PRACTICE DUE TO THE TRAGEDY OF LOSING EVERYONE - SHOTS OF WORK THAT DOCUMENTS EVENTS IN OUR DIMENSION**

1. **HEROINE URGENTLY YEARNS TO RECONNECT WITH THE FEMININE.** The heroine wants to, but is unable to return to their initial limited state/position
**LOSS OF CREATIVE PRACTICE DUE TO THE TRAGEDY OF LOSING EVERYONE - THE HUM STOPS** 
1. **HEROINE HEALS THE MOTHER/DAUGHTER SPLIT.** The heroine reclaims some of their initial values, skills, or attributes (or those of others like them) but now views these traits from a new perspective.
**STARTS CREATING AGAIN TO ESCAPE THE FEELINGS OF WORTHLESSNESS AND SOLITUDE; MESSAGES COME BACK** 

1. **HEROINE HEALS THE WOUNDED MASCULINE WITHIN.** The heroine makes peace with the “masculine” approach to the world as it applies to them.

**MAKES PEACE WITH THEIR OWN MASCULINITY, WITHOUT HORMONES. LEARNS THEY CREATE OUR REALITY** 

1. **HEROINE INTEGRATES THE MASCULINE & FEMININE.** In order to face the world/future with a new understanding of themselves and the world/life, the heroine integrates the “masculine” and “feminine” qualities/perspectives. This permits the heroine to see through binaries and to interact with a complex world that includes the heroine but is also larger than their personal lifetime or their geographical/cultural milieu.
**MESSAGES START REVEALING THE TRUTH (THAT THEY ARE IN A GAME BEING PLAYED BY THE PLAYER, AND THAT THEIR ART IS CREATING OUR UNIVERSE IN TURN). BECOMES AT PEACE WITH THE FACT THERE IS A PARALLEL VERSION OF THEMSELVES STILL IN A WORLD WITH OTHER PEOPLE. INTEGRATION OF THE TWO MIRROR SELVES (ONE MORE FEMININE, ONE MORE MASCULINE)** 


Mysterious sound plays in the air - The Hum 

Character starts to hear messages in the Hum 

Shots of antipsychotic meds to make audience not believe MC 
- “Hallucinations” are actually messages in the Hum, which are actually the writer of the story’s thoughts
- Actions of MC reflect messages in the Hum
- Creations of MC create our reality 
	- Hints shown throughout such as perhaps a story about covid they are writing, or a game they are coding, or a 


Mixture of languages 
Sounds demonic 
Scary 
Some parts make sense 
The sound learns algorithmically what makes sense to the listener 
Until everybody is hearing something in their own language 

Aliens suspected 

Surreal lynchian moments to suggest it’s a dream 

No other characters, no interaction, to create more surreality through isolation 

No dialogue(?) We don’t know if the MC can speak(?) 


Careers:
- Organologist(?) 
- Visual artist 
- Writer 
- Programmer 

Stories/art becomes prophetic once inspired by the messages from within the Hum 


Trees/mycelium - messages become clearer near trees 

Character keeps dying? 


Ale - Xiu Xiu is in the soundtrack, use as inspiration

META MOMENT - crucial. Looking at camera 

Character starts to gain insight that they are in a web series 

Maybe multiple characters played by same person to discombobulate and confuse audience 



Create social media accounts for the character 
Eventually comment on the videos 



Character has travelled to a dimension where covid killed everyone?

Writes code that can transmit signal from another dimension (ours) 

Allows them to comment on videos 

Scene where they find the videos and start typing the comment

Conversation between writer (me) and character (different version of me) in comments 

Some kind of reciprocity- 
I write the events of their life and they write the events of ours 


Finding notes around written by past self 
\wakes up each day having forgotten nobody else on earth is alive
