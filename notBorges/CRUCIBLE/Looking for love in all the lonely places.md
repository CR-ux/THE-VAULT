permalink: Looking for love in all the lonely places
---
Looking around at all the worn out faces 
Warm to the touch with empty traces 
Of 
Looking for love 
So we won't need this stuff 
To carry on 

Perfection was a fad 
One I never had 
But I wanted to 

Talk to my dad 
Like one of the lads 
About things we used to do 

Resurrection of bad 
Memories to 
Hold onto 

Bring up the sludge 
An ink stain a smudge 
On a letter sealed with superglue 

I learnt to be tough 
When the going got rough 
But now I've had enough 
X2 

Want the chance to say 
Three syllable cliche
That never came my way 
Want my friends to see 
I can be 
Happy 
But it starts with me 
I know it all starts with me 
That's what he said in therapy 

Just wanna be loved 
Just wanna be touched 
Just drwanna be good enough
