A huge bumblebee flew out of my old place as I was leaving 
My first morning here a bee of the same size tried to fly into my open window, hovering just outside 
It felt so so sacred 

Barnie is lending me money to cover the rent, I am not alone 

My chair arrived 

I had speech therapy 

The record cabinet is still available
