I was visited by 7 angels 



LOVE; BEGINNING TO END

The shimmering blindness 
Of a beginning;
Intoxicating

As yet another ending 
tells me this: 

I am my own great river 
My love like stepping stones 
Each man a gateway 
to the next 
Each one 
a quiet wave

A reflectionâ€™s shudder 
A ripple of judgement 
a life-raft, an opportunity 
To be seen, as a mirror

In the spoiling swirls of love 
Gripped at the ankle 
By some forgotten weed 
I am dragged in my nakedness 
Planting insignificant seeds 
Letting rot my shameful garden 
Laying waste in my beaten heart 

The dulling visage 
Of all my endings; 
Unbearable
