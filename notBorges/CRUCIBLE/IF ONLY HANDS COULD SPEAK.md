was SELECTED FOR HOMOGRAFIA FESTIVAL IN BRUSSELS
This marks my first official, external selection (outside of Spit It Out) for my LIVE ART PRACTICE in an INTERNATIONAL ARENA 

I am so overjoyed 
I know I can do this 
I know everything is leading to the next thing 
All these KATABASIS performances 
The gallery performance at last year’s SIO festival 



In order to quit smoking 
I must replace this ORAL STIMMING METHOD 
With MOVEMENT 
Movement is above the mouth in my sensory hierarchy 
This can be skating in sunny weather 
But I would like to start RUNNING again 
Which can be done when it is raining, too 


It will be HARD 
At first 
But it will be SO WORTH IT 

To feel my lungs clearing 
To eliminate the nicotine from my body faster 
To sweat out my trauma from my pores 
To even run to the place where I will skate 
And back 

Each run a heroine’s journey 
Each one a victorious EXCLAMATION to the universe 
To the world 
That I am HERE 
I am LOVING MY BODY 
and I am treating it well 

Eating well 
Not obsessing over caloric intake 
Because I will be healthily using energy 
And regulating, not just my internal physical health 
But also my mental health 

I pace around this flat so much 
I am so often exhausted of energy from socialising 
Running is a solitary act that can be done alongside my favourite activity; music 

I will do this 
I WILL quit cigarettes 
Get back the circulation 
In so many ways 

And I will
Perform in Brussels 
And I will become 
Everything I’ve ever wanted to be 
Because I am already there 
I am already her 
I am doing it 
I AM DOING IT 

I HAVE DONE IT
SO MOTE IT BE
