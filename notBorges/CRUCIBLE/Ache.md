Everything I ever wanted 
Doesn’t feel so good at all 
I have found you 
I have found you
The world found us 
The world came up out of the sea to meet us
The world bent itself into pretzels for us
Bent itself broken to bring my face to the crook of your neck
Where I found everything I ever wanted 
And found it doesn’t feel so good at all

I found myself in death
And you found me in a life
Not finished yet
The world had plans for us

A cigarette 
Accordion 
Breath 
I don’t want to be finished yet
An empty fuck
Rejection
Death
I’m all bent broken and upset 

I don’t want to talk to any of my friends
I don’t want love from whoever would love this 
I want to move away from this place
I want to unzip my skin and fall upward to the ether
I don’t wan’t to be dead 
I just want to kill all the selves that led me here
I just want to kill the selves that everyone has met 

A line of ket 
A funeral
A cigarette
A dying pet 
A little lie 
A marmoset 


Everything I ever wanted 
Doesn’t feel so good at all

O The shimmering blindness
Of a beginning;
Intoxicating -

As yet another Ending caresses my hair 
bicep bulging as a lock is tucked 
and turned behind my ear
the Ending shifts his weight in finality 
across the bench
we have come to call our own
to smile, popping spit bubbles 
formed in the corners of his lips
to lean 
into the crook of my neck 
to whisper down my closing throat
and gently tell me this:

"You Are 
your own great river
Your love 
like stepping stones”

Each man a gateway
to the next
Each one
a quiet wave
A reflection’s shudder
In a ripple of judgement
a life-rafted opportunity
To be seen
as a mirror"

Then in 
the spoiling swirls of love
Gripped at the ankle
By some forgotten weed
Nicked at the knee 
By the sharpest rocks 
the Men condensed 
and pressured themselves into
and I am dragged 
in my nakedness
skin burning, like a comet 
an uncontainable ether 
tethered to this wretched weight
a thinning shard of glass 
and a makeup brush
to shape a heaving block 
of granite 

And at the bottom
I plant my insignificant seeds
Letting rot my shameful garden
Upon the surface
Laying waste 
my raked and beaten heart

The dulling visage
Of all my endings;
Unbearable.
