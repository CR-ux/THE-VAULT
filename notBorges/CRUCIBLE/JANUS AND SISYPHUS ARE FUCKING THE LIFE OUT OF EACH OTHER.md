permalink: JANUS AND SISYPHUS ARE FUCKING THE LIFE OUT OF EACH OTHER
---
(A poem at 28,000 feet)

Janus 
And sisyphus 
Are fucking 
The life 
Out of each other 

And rows of roses 
Are falling in mourning 

The light blue is seeping 
A pang of forgiveness 
And all of us sleeping
And all of us sleeping 

A life set in plaster
On indolent waves 
The eaten, the restless
In strawberry caves

A chalice of onyx 
Once held us inside 
My insides, nipped outside 
For another
skinny 
Skinny
Slim cigarette 

And guilt
And such guilt
For existing in this 
Absolute uniqueness 
Alone in this world 
With togetherness 
and regret 


And all of us sleeping 
And caressing our hair 
And intimacy, currency 
I Gave Up Absolutely 
Nothing 
In moments of presence 
delicious 
locked stare 

The guilt: testosterone
Life's punctuation of
Death's sentence 
Guilt is my mirror 
Always
has been 

And beads of milky sweat 
Are falling 
From janus's forehead 
Collecting a foundation 
(Brick by briquet)
Two shades too light 
The salt and the oil mixing together
Submerging infinitesimal crumbs within friends 

And janus is tired now 
As the sphere of sweat undulates 
In the beesting of an eternity 
Of a moment 
Suspended in gravity
Falling, into the open mouth 
Of sispyhus 
And now from the pore
Poor excretion
Touching land after travelling 
(Denying christ three times 
Three days without estrogen)


Thisbe's fingertip outstretched through a break in a fenceÂ  
Kissing transparent skin 
Of the tongue 
Of sisyphus 
In the palm of Pyramus 

Injection 
To the armed morpheus 
Castrated 

All of us sleeping 
All of us sleeping 

And waking a theft 
A serpentine requiem
is swallowing its tail 


Sisypus is whispering 
Condensation in waxed ear 
Of janus 

Tastebud to cilia
Saliva to blood
Water 
to whine 

Janus turns over 
Assumes the position 
Safety
In cut wires 
Weightlessness
An abattoir hook 

Janus
Believing,
So solidly: 

"I will never deserve 
To be touched 
To be kissed -
my endings are my world 
My endings are everything" 

And His wilted nose is bleeding 
The eyes in the back of the head 
Are blinding 
And sisyphus licks the dripped iron from shoulder 


Sisyphus 
Whispering 
So gently, 
"Beginning like this 
My darling -
How could i ever 
hold up the weight
Of your boulder"
