permalink: The ambiguity of the moon
---
The ugliest most beautiful thing I've ever seen 
Like a first born no longer
He took the chair, turned it upside down 
Like Cassiopeia 
In the stars 

Outside he stands alone
No umbilical cord to tug upon 
Wishing for all the things unknown 
For everything 
That's gone 

No paper or pen
Nails bit to the quick
He patiently ponders on 
Ambiguous moon
In silent reverie
