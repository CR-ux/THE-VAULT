Dear Mum,

On this beautiful occasion of your birthday (a day all about you for once, please remember to put yourself first and hang up your unwavering selflessness at least for these 24 hours!!!), I find myself reaching deep into the reservoirs of my heartâ€™s fondest memories to express the profound gratitude and immeasurable love I hold for you. As I reflect on my journey of becoming my truest self, your unwavering support and boundless compassion at every stage stand as the beacon that guided me through the tumultuous seas of self-discovery. Embracing my identity was a path fraught with challenges, yet, with you by my side (whether in the same location or not, I carry your heart, I carry it in my heart), those challenges transformed into stepping stones towards authenticity.

Your role in my life transcends that of a mother; you are the most powerful, creative, and compassionate woman I have ever known, shaping not only the person I was growing up but also the adult I am today. Your strength and grace in the face of so much adversity have taught me resilience, while your empathy and kindness have shown me the beauty and importance of genuine human connection.

Having you as a role model has been the universe's greatest gift to me. Your lessons in love, courage, and integrity resonate deeply within my soul, every breath, given by you, guiding me towards my own light. Your example has empowered me to live my truth boldly and unapologetically, and itâ€™s just been so edifying to experience this positive feedback loop of self improvement and discovery that is shared between us. 

So, on this day I think itâ€™s quite important to sayâ€¦ I love you to the moon and back, up the blasted chimney, round and round those darn goose's chambers again and again!!! Your love is a boundless embrace of warmth and wonder, that ricochets further throughout the world than we could ever know; I am so grateful and endlessly proud to be your daughter. In all your trying, striving and working for the care of others, both in your home and work life, you really do make the world a better and brighter place for everyone: I hope hearing and knowing this carries you through the manifold tough moments of sacrifice and thankless effort you put into your incredibly important and noble job. I am just so, so proud of you. 

Thank you for everything, Mum. Here's to celebrating you today and always, for you are truly the most maternally nurturing soul, gracing the earth with your love and care for those most in need of it ðŸ–¤

With all my endless love and heartfelt gratitude,

Callie ðŸŒ¹
