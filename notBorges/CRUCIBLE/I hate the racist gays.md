I hate the racist gays 
Were so good to me then asked me not to change 
Those white cis men got a lot of pain to prove 
And they tried to make me move 
But I’ve been clawing through this mud 
While you sit on the roof 

I’m a witch 
I’m an Other 
I’m a wild 
Fae godmother
I got thinner for my paint 
I will not feel ashamed 
Not in stealth 
But a queen 
I’m what it in between 
You know you wouldn’t want just any other gay 

So take me as I am 
Or y’know don’t ‘cause I can find a better man 
Who isn’t a misogynist so fearful of the truth
 
Lambasting the femininity inside of you
