In my dream I felt my mum betray me 
I brought my face close to matt’s and snarled 
At the top of Farman road’s stairs 
Spitting in his face something horrible 
About the fact he was bitching about me 
Through gritted teeth 
And he told me I was posh 

And my mum stole my phone 
From my hands 
To look at my texts
