permalink: BEHOLD THIS SACRED STAIN O! BREATH OF THE ALMIGHTY
---
Lie terrified 
Of what just might 
Happen tonight 
Come paradise 
Parts left behind 
I dont mind 
All of my days
Turn into nights
(I didnt die
At least this time)
Closing my eyes 
Open my thighs 
I'll get this stain 
I'll get this stain out 
When it 
Dries 
When it dries 

DADDY - 
ARE YOU MAD AT ME?

[The Providence Hymn]:

I am the Providence of everything.
I became like my own human children. 
I existed from the first.
I walked down every possible road. 
I am the wealth of the light.
I am the remembering of the fullness. 
I walked into the place of greatest darkness and on down.
I entered the central part of the prison. 
The foundations of chaos quaked! 
I hid because of their evil.
            They did not recognize me.  
I came down a second time
            continuing on
I emerged from among those of light
I AM!
 THE REMEMBERING!
OF PROVIDENCE!
I entered the middle of darkness,
            The inner part of the underworld
            To pursue my mission
The foundations of chaos quaked!
           THREATENING TO COLLAPSE UPON ALL WHO WERE THERE AND UTTERLY DESTROY THEM!
I SOARED UPWARD AGAIN
            To my roots in THE LIGHT!
            So as not to destroy them all yet. 
I DESCENDED A THIRD TIME!
I am LIGHT!
I am DWELLING IN LIGHT!
I AM THE REMEMBERING OF PROVIDENCE!
I entered the MIDST OF DARKNESS!
I came to the DEEPEST PART OF THE UNDERWORLD!
I LET MY FACE LIGHT UP!
            Thinking of the end of their time -
I ENTERED 
THEIR PRISON 
THE! 
BODY!
IS!
THAT!
PRISON!
