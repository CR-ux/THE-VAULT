FAME 



Gosh it’s already making me emotional 
I feel it so palpably 


In this experience 
That exists as a frequency in the quantum field 
I am a world renowned conceptual artist and musician 
I have hundreds of thousands of patrons all contributing directly to my practice out of deep understanding and recognition of authenticity in my work 
I am entirely famous, invited to appear at festivals, to talk at universities, to score films, a national treasure, world-beloved - but entirely humble, and absolutely genuinely the most true version of myself. 
I can speak 5 languages as a result of all my travelling
I have a collection of pianos on which to record, multiple Steinways, with my favourite one being in the top of the tower turret attached to my bedroom in the gothic castle in which I live with my team and husband. 
I have a wonderful team of managers, recording engineers, instrumentalists, marketing assistants, writers, admin staff, luthiers and makers, all of which are my dear, dear friends and all of whom are respected, cherished and equal parts of the team. 
I travel the world to perform art rituals, which are contemplative and sometimes challenging in nature, confronting themes of Selfhood, the body, no-body, and identity through a lens of mysticism and hermetic wisdom. 
I get to spend most of my days reading and creating work, taking field recordings and composing, taking walks with my loving, caring, masculine and gentle husband. 
He and I live in one part of the castle, and the team works in the other; it is very easy to have privacy or to have togetherness, due to the labyrinthine nature of the space, and I decide day to day whether I’m even going into the offices, or just staying in my tower to work.
