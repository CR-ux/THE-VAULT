Obviously no pressure and seriously I won’t feel bad at all if you say no because we are all very busy human alien hybrids!!! And I do sincerely apologise if it wasn’t cool of me to ask in the first place. But the record will probably be sent to press around September? So 6 months 
 
I actually think this one I sent you would sound incredible with ur vocal accompaniment (whispered at the beginning and then screaming at the coda) 
but also if the project moves you and you want to be involved in an engineering capacity I have a mixing/mastering budget from the two grants I’ve got this year but idk if you freelance. It’ll probably be a 7 track release, double sided LP
