TRACK 4: BEHOLD THIS SACRED STAIN
Could do with some legato beauty at the top
Descent - crazy discordant runs, becoming more and more intensely violent 
“I am LIGHT” - very high note, maybe trill 
“I am the remembering of providence” - triplet run 
End just go nuts and do what you want 

TRACK 5: YOUR WORD IS MY BOND
Lots of trills and gypsy-esque sounds in the intro to match the intensity of the glitched out Vox
Descending motif on “sin, sin, sin”
Ascending motif on “to place upon his throat a knife”
Alternating notes on “grating appetite” to harmonise with Vox 
Alternating notes(?) on piano section to harmonise with piano 
- This bit we can do a couple of layers of loops harmonising with each other, so you don’t have to actually play them this quickly and for this long
Silence for octave precoda section
An insane crescendo upward run just before the “I DEVOUR THE AFFLICTED FROM THE EARTH” kicks in to tie together the sections
Just go absolutely crazy on the coda! I do not give a shit about key signatures, about dynamics, just GO NUTS!!!!


TRACK 6: TARTARUS 
Screeches and squeals in chorus parts to match the yodelling (keep the energy from the end of last track)

Complimentary melody in ascending section (“my shame it will swaddle Yo-o-o-ours”)
Dotted minor third rhythms in noizy coda (“mother blighting fruits of earth”) 
Screamed prechorus “VERILY I BUILD SUCH FRAIL HOUSES” could be good with triplet staccato punches in harmony 
Either melody or harmony to quiet “verily I build such frail houses” prechorus

(If time) TRACK 7: LATRODECTUS LAZARUS 
General beautiful legato motifs along with the simple piano part.
