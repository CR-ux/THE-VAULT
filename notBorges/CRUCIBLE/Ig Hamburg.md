My @ehfm_live radio show (now titled “the medium is the wreckage”) has gone through a trans(?!)mutation.

The focus is the same, exploring the concept of abrasion in all its forms: whether that be ear shattering noise or heart wrenching emaciated vulnerability- the latter of which I feel is mirrored by my trying to speak more on the show, practising techniques from my vocal feminisation therapy in such a scarily public way 

The episode is comprised of entirely original and unreleased orchestral noise works (every episode of the show has become mostly original work at this point anyway), incorporating @go.me.da modded tape decks and drones, field recordings, a series of in progress tracks including a ballad I’m very proud of that are potentially going on the next full length, recordings of band rehearsals with Masha on violin and santi on cello, and a very raw live phone recording of a tribute to a lost friend. 

I hope you enjoy this new chapter, which will be airing on Hamburg’s @sic.nal Monday evening 7pm UK time, 8pm Germany time
