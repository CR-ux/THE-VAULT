<span style="color:#000ff;">I'll be your brother</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Like I've always been</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">& you don't need to think</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">About anything</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">Cus you and me</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">You've opened every doorway to my heart</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">So many doors I never knew I had right from the start</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">You've made me want to go on just to make sure</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">We'll never ever ever be apart</span>
