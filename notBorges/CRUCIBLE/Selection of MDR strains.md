There are good signs that should be followed
and there are bad signs that you should escape 
- N.B.



	2020, Here for three weeks started my phd, Been ok since moving here but then had to have an emergency tooth extraction last week and my mental state has declined rapidly to the point where I feel I'm worse than I was five years ago which was my third suicide attempt at the start of my undergrad course 2012
	Obsessive intrusive very negative and self-attacking thoughts about even the smallest thing depression which has got slightly better over the years but I still have some days/weeks/months where I am unable to clean my flat, lose personal hygiene and don't care about anything, dissociate from reality when my anxiety gets too much (intense derealisation/depersonalization), very very intense splitting, idealization/devaluation of people that has led to a string of tumultuous relationships, have really intense bouts of crying and always always have ever since I was very little; crying is heavily associated with shame, my mum used to tell me to "choose to be straight" and that she had gay thoughts when she was younger that it was just a phase,my dad would scoff and wince at any kind of gay thing on TV or in real life, as well as constant bullying in school for acting feminine so a heavily invalidating environment and I didn't come out until after my first near-successful suicide attempt at 18 (first one was at about 16 when I got really drunk). My mum herself showed very strong borderline traits when I was young and into my teenage years, they would fight most nights, regularly physically, and be drinking at least three bottles of wine a night- she threw a wine bottle at his face once and that's why he has a huge scar across his forehead, didn't see this as a child but found out years later, I saw a lot of this violence like my dad pulling my mum around by the hair when she tried to slap him, my sister and I would be crying and screaming and then my dad would threaten to put us into care, this culminating in her cheating on my dad for 6 months during my a levels (which I was aware of and had to keep secret on top of studying trying to get into med school) and dad found out on Christmas Eve, very violent and loud traumatic evening in 2010, then centre parcs which used to be an annual family holiday but it was just me and him, I heard him crying and kicking and punching himself every night about it, 
	Urges to self harm used to keep at bay with smoking weed for five years, which gave me agoraphobia but was preferable over constant self harming and the hiding of cuts 
	Haven't smoked in 17 days feeling glad about that and free of it but thoughts of self harming have come back,
	Impulsivity, dangerous behaviour in phases of obsession (e.g. Drug use, period of using MDMA and LSD multiple times a week over the last few years almost as a form of self harm in itself, feel free of that now I've moved here though), unable to regulate my emotions, stressed so easily, paranoid delusions, psychotic episodes characterized by apophenia, feeling like I control reality itself or some kind of matrix type situation is happening and the visual noise/hallucinations (flashing lights, pulsating and shaking vision, stars, patterns in grain of wood/carpet/wallpaper)  seem like glitches in reality as if it's a computer program that I am getting higher knowledge of that other people can't see, conversely like people know something that they aren't telling me, - these psychotic experiences have been made worse by the mirtazapine so I'd like to stop and take something more suited to BPD instead like an antipsychotic and a mood stabiliser. CONSTANT guilt, like I don't deserve anything because of all the terrible things I've done interchanging with I deserve everything and everyone else is worthless (which feeds back into the former), embarrassment = utter shame, constantly afraid of what others think of me, feeling full is a horrible repulsive feeling to me, feeling hungry and empty is nice but makes me really anxious, I'm terrified of people hearing my stomach rumble so I feel stuck in a state of not wanting to eat but desperately not wanting my stomach to make noises. On top f all thisi feel like a fucking idiot for  even trying to access mental health services and that there are people in way more need than me, doubting my past self's, sometimes current self's, and possibly future self's desire to die which makes me want to do it just to prove my internal doubt wrong, I hate myself more than anything but at times think I'm an amazing person, I feel like my family are hiding something from me that happened when I was a very young child perhaps sexual abuse and I used to have nightmares about fireworks and when I woke up I would lie because I was ashamed of being so scared of fireworks, and I don't know why, and I feel like something traumatic could have happened during a firework display that I was associating the sound with (possibly to cover the sound of my screams), I am missing some big chunks of memory from youth but I have a fantastic memory and can see some things so clearly like when I was 5 during 'circle time' and my friend said "I would make a really pretty girl" and I was really grateful he said that and then everyone laughed and I realized he was teasing me and that was the point that I knew I wasn't allowed to be what I wanted, that I wS somehow different and that was lesser than average and inferior to everyone else, I have gender issues and started to feel better once I'd grown my hair, but still feel very dysphoric when looking at myself and seeing predominantly masculine features, I wish I could express my gender identity properly but the fear associated with being attacked for presenting femme is overwhelming and stops me from being who I want to be.
