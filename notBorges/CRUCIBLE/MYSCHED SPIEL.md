Roles applied for 24-03 (TICKED = ADDED TO TRACKER)

From my 3-month School of Tech Futures training (starting 7th Dec 2022), delivered internally by Accenture, I have developed significant proficiency and interest in front-end technologies, particularly React, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I gained valuable knowledge and insight into version control with Git over the ten weeks, and while I am also lead developer for a grant-funded full-stack creative project in my spare time, it was this intensive period of collaboration within an agile methodology (acting as both front-end developer and Scrum Master in my final project) that really crystallised my learning into an applicable skillset that can be carried forward for industry roles and work with external stakeholders. I applied myself wholeheartedly to the course content during School of Tech and know this has been one of the most valuable learning experiences of my career to date.
Prior to joining Accenture, I was working as a PhD researcher on a Bioinformatics project that focussed on elucidating SNP determinants of host resistance to Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, involving big data analytics with R, python, and job queueing with SGE on an HPCC at the Roslin Institute. I became very interested in OOP at this time, immersing myself fully in the Python programming language, gaining acumen in DevOps and Linux navigation, as well as writing my own bioinformatics runner scripts in Bash.
After this, I was awarded a grant by Creative Informatics to develop a web app (based in a MERN stack) that provides an interactive musical experience to the user, including original music compositions. This forms much of my side of desk work and provides a fantastic circularity to my programming practice - allowing me to solidify the entirety of what I have learned over the course of the bootcamp - from design, to build, to deployment, and improving my proficiency in AWS, CI CD and automation - tools absolutely crucial in the modern development space.

I have gravitated naturally towards a career in software development, which I believe so perfectly infuses the technical and creative facets of my mind.   
I am very proud of the depth and breadth of knowledge I have gained in such a short period of time at Accenture, and I am so excited to start the next part of my journey!
