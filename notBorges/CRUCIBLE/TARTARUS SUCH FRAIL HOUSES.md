I BRING THE SICKNESS OF THE WORLD 
WITH MY DRUM WITH MY DRUM WITH MY DRUMDRUMDRUMDRUMDRUMDRUMDRUM DRUM DRUM
I HOLD THE ILLNESS OF THE WORLD 
IN MY DRUM IN MY DRUM IN MY DRUMDRUMDRUMDRUMDRUMDRUM 
BEHOLD THE SICKNESS OF THE WORLD

ONCE FAGGOT, 
TWICE ANANSI, GIRL
 

Descending from c#min, cNatural, amaj, F#
YOU, DEAR CHILD, ARE MY WEAPONS
AND MY SHAME ECLIPSES YOURS (Ab)
NOW TAKE YOUR INVINCIBLE SHAFTS
DRINK THE WATER OF MY GUORD 
AND SHOOT THOSE SWIFT-FLYING ARROWS 
into tHE wretched HEART OF GOD (^)
A THIRD OF THE WORLD IS AT STAKE (C#Min, B, A, F#)
MY (C#) SHAME (C) WILL SWADDLE YOURS (C#, D#, E, AB, E, D#, C#) F#
[BASS ASCENDING FROM AMAJ]
  MOTHER BLIGHTING FRUITS OF EARTH (C#, D#, E, AB, E, D#, C# ONWARDS)
OPENED HERSELF TO AFFORD 
A WAY CONVEYED THROUGH BOTTOMMOST CAVES
WITH A CLEW OF UMBILICAL CORD 
AS I CONSORT SUPREME 
TO THE SOVEREIGN LORD 
IN THE DWELLING OF THE MINOTAUR
IN THE CENTRE OF MY GREATEST SHAME 
I AM GIVING BIRTH TO ALL OF YOURS

VERILY I BUILD SUCH FRAIL HOUSES 
VERILY I PLUCKED A CRIMSON POMEGRANATE FRUIT  
VERILY I ATE THE SEVEN SEEDS AND A
COCKROACH’S MACHETE SLASHED IN HALF MY SUIT



A RIVER OF WOE UNDER HEAVY ROCK  
MINE IS THE MINOTAUR’s LOOM OF VIOLENCE 
There’s A THREAD INSTEAD OF TRACT OF SKY 
I WAS SNATCHED FROM THE BACK WHILE PICKING VIOLETS 
BORN FOLORN TO A CITY OF RUINS
WEAVING SEETHING AND ANGRY GODS INTO MY WOOL 
AGAIN I, I have TRIED TO HARVEST FLOWERS
BUT WAS SEDUCED BY ZEUS in the guise of a BULL
BEHOLD THE OCTAVE OF MY FINGERS 
STRETCHED OUT at my side AS LEGS TO WALK UPON 
AND ALL AROUND NOW, DEATH IT LINGERS 
BENEATH THE VEIL OF METATRON
