Bless the sword, O my soul, and forget not all its benefits 


Take care, lest you forget 


Deutoronomy 4:9

*remember everything*


Ab, Fm
Devour every one of my sons 
Bb, Db, Eb
Regurgitate them in the words I sing 
Ab, Bb, Eb, 
From whence the flesh left upon my tongue 
Db, Bb, Eb, Cm, / Ab
Remember everything 


Devour every one of my sons 
Regurgitate them in the words I sing 
From whence the flesh left upon my tongue 
Remember everything 

Devour every one of my sons 
scurf oesophagus with all their cloven wings 
From whence the thread winds and unwinds unbroken 
Remember everything 

Devour every one of my sons 
And birth the countless death’s they’ll bring 
When war’s forgiveness has been won 
(Devour every one of my sons 
Born of hunger not to be forgotten)

Remember everything    

Devour every one of my sons 
And birth the countless death’s they’ll bring 
When war’s forgiveness has been won 
I will Remember everything
