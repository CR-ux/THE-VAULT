i remember sitting on your left
your eyes were on the road
i remember my hand on your neck
i couldn't wait to take you home
your eyes were so blue
and i wanted them all over me
i couldn't keep mine off of you
taking in all i could see
your hair danced when the windows were down
danced around your pale white skin
i remember when you'd come round
i'd be bark and you porcelain
i remember all the times we'd be
laughing in that yellow car
i remember when i didn't see
you for what you really are
i remember walking in the rain
your bright red hair got soaking wet
and now i know it's not that i remember
it's that i just can't forget
your hair danced when the windows were down
danced around your pale white skin
i wanted to scream but never made a sound
i'd be bark and you
a mannequin
i won't forget loving you, in the sun
porcelain, dry and peeling
but i never really loved you, did I
i just loved the feeling.
