VETTING APPN

Tidy up house 
 
Really properly finish setup of Ubuntu machine, no matter how much I resist it 
Same thing with Scala Opencast training… it’s urgent 


Have call with sandy about the ticket at work 

Make an Amazon purchase to reward and only to reward myself (but good for my life things like travellers notebook/ piano stool / bedsheets / new clothes ) 

*STRETCH*
Maybe make a start on conceptualising the Glasgow cathedral organ recording / VST project for which I am applying to creative Scotland’s open fund
