None of this means anything 
It doesn’t matter why you hit me 
It just matters that you did 




Nothing to hold onto 

When’s my turn 
I won’t learn 





(Don’t need response to this know you’re at work. Respond, or don’t, when finished ,if you like,up to you )

christ I was so happy and glad to have made a friend in Rory that I had sexual chemistry with so I  could distribute  the burden of my needs somewhat &wouldn’t feel so stupidly childishly let down all the time when our/david’s dates didn’t happen. Especially after things with David have ended and things with Rory won’t happen anymore ,I feel really crap about how much I lean on you for so many things .and react so poorly to just human life happening  and how my brain right now seems to not trust or believe anything i , trying to get back to me but idk where the fuck she is rn  . Gona get some weed and food and just try my best to not feel like this is just past saturation point , I’m sure it’s just all the things happening lately . Maybe I get so panicked and upset when you cancel for being too tired bc of that stupid night  that I can’t fucking get out of my stupid heart when I was in crisis and you flaked bc u said u were tired but weren’t actually telling the whole truth and wanted to be with Kayla , which was ofc fine in itself , just wish you’d told me what was happening .just find it so hard to trust anything rn; I’m sure it’s not even you , maybe just not made for relationships , maybe too much happened to me . Know I’m
Not made for monogamy ,  maybe I’m not made for polyamory either , maybe this , waiting around for someone I love  to text me when something better hasn’t come along for them is just my lot  





I absolutely will examine further my insecurities, and think it would be also worth you examining why when I bring up a way in which I feel hurt it gets turned around on me without you hearing what I’m saying because I absolutely am hearing what you’re saying about the insecurities


i will examine my insecurities further yes. I will unpack and examine myself again and again and hear you again and again but maybe you examine why any time I feel hurt it seems to turn into a conversation about the ways in which I’ve upset you, or why I need to console you when you let me down .  Your tone and the way you respond when feeling defensive can be really emotionally manipulative . Read this text you sent for one example. Read it. I’ll tell you what’s not _fair_ barnabie. Me immediately and apologetically hearing you when you bring up a way in which you feel I’ve hurt you, straight after really big things have happened that I’ve tried to bring up ina. Very collected way. The conversation getting turned onto the ways in which _i_ need to change and unpack my insecurities and mw always being receptive to that. Only ever talking on your terms, even after  Being *physically assaulted*.  In fact , consoling you about your other relationship the first time I saw you after the assault. You not showing up or being physically there for me after the assault for two nights because , in your words via text “you were looking after Sylvia” . So of _course_ I am going to feel extra insecure right now . What has happened has very nearly broke me . I am heartbroken. I am absolutely heartbroken. I am sick of entering a phase in which you close off and don’t talk and get mad at me for bringing something up that I feel hurt or upset about, and then finally whenever we do talk again you saying you wanted to break up or making me feel like
The one in the wrong . Don’t worry. I’ll give you your 2024 back  barnabie. 







Losing control of my truth 
Altered the way i saw you 
Deleted all of my youth 
Extricated rotten tooth 

Losing control of her dues 
Alternate girl waits for you 
Deleted memories all come unglued 
Print out a warning of what to eschew 

Holding control of the truth 
Altercation is making me lose 
Deleting pleasant memories of you 
And all the love that I thought I knew 



Altercation 
Altered 

Must i forever surrender my dreams 
For the sake of you waking from a good night’s sleep 


Extrication 

Tooth 

Empty clotless socket remains 
All Stitched up and dried out again 



Em, 
It’s clear you’ll never hear me until i shout 
So I’ll write you once my cigarettes have run out 
With my breath i do my best to take in the lessons I’ve learned 



Must i forever surrender my dreams 
For the sake of you waking from a good night’s sleep 

Losing control 

You can be top or bottom I don’t mind 
Just happy to be close to you sometimes 




Where were you 
I needed you 
No longer believe in you 

Given up waiting when I most need you 

Given up waiting 
For you to come through 
Given up waiting 
For the littlest sign of you 

Loving me 
Now I see 
Cold coffee 
At the kitchen 
Table quandary 


Oh what a terribly hard place to be stuck in shock 
Knowing an ending my heart beaten down here to rot 
The whittling down of what I thought was my rock 
Belittled and wishing that I’d just forgot 

Clear to see you’ll never hear me unless I shout 
Yet I’ll write you once my cigarettes have run out 


Can’t seem to see how this just cannot serve me 
Didn’t deserve how you didn’t deserve me
Wood has made way for these trees of uncertainty
That Won’t have grown fruit by the time I am thirty 
Can’t seem to see how you just cannot serve me 
Didn’t deserve all the ways that you hurt me 
All our crossed wires and this faulty Circuitry 
Wouldn’t unearth all the ways you desert me 
All our crossed paths and the wrath you lashed out on me 
Couldn’t surpass the sheer mass of what it meant to be 

Held 
By 
You 

Something 
To 
You 


Loved 
By
You 

Crumbs 
Of
You

Sustained on the 
Crumbs 
Of 
You 



Silence screamed for rest
