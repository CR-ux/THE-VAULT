Bunch of meetings yesterday, met with AoG and sat in on a call with the rest of the test team looking over i2k logs and then in afternoon had a 121 with Anya 
Managed to close off ORD TC ticket and complete my required e&c training 
Then after a too late lunch started looking over the i2k validation estimate for this application and working against the first few test cases and I do think 25 hours perhaps seems generous, but I’ve been assigned the validation ticket for ORD and I’m working on this today 

Is the dev test catchup happening today?
