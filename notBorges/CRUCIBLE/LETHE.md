Nor death itself can wholly wash their stains; 
But long-contracted filth ev'n in the soul remains. 
The relics of inveterate vice they wear, 
And spots of sin obscene in ev'ry face appear. 
For this are various penances enjoin'd; 
And some are hung to bleach upon the wind, 
Some plung'd in waters, others purg'd in fires, 
Till all the dregs are drain'd, and all the rust expires. 
All have their manes, and those manes bear: 
The few, so cleans'd, to these abodes repair, 
And breathe, in ample fields, the soft Elysian air. 
Then are they happy, when by length of time 
The scurf is worn away of each committed crime; 
No speck is left of their habitual stains, 
But the pure ether of the soul remains. 
But, when a thousand rolling years are past, 
(So long their punishments and penance last,) 
Whole droves of minds are, by the driving god, 
Compell'd to drink the deep Lethaean flood, 
In large forgetful draughts to steep the cares 
Of their past labors, and their irksome years, 
That, unrememb'ring of its former pain, 
The soul may suffer mortal flesh again.
