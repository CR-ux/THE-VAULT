Ollie
Mommy’s 
Sorry

She couldn’t hold all of this at once 


Ollie 
Mommy’s 
Sorry 
She couldn’t hold on to you long enough 

Ollie 
Mommy’s 
Sorry
But she’s had enough 
Of all of this earthly stuff 


Remember to brush your hair 
Trust that the humans care 
Rest well and eat coriander 
Oleander 
I’ll love you 


Mommy 
Couldn’t hold all of this 
Long enough to hold you 
Ollie won’t you
Remember 
To brush your long black hair 
Stay presentable 
I promise 
Mommy didn’t do this 
To get away from you 
She did it to get 
Back to her  
Oleander 
Please remember 
To rest and eat 
Your coriander 
Ollie 
Mommy’s sorry 
But she’s had enough 
Of earthly stuff
Ollie 
Mommy’s sorry 
She’s in a cage of human making 
Will be better on the other 
side of aching 
she just wants you to know 
How loved you are 



Been a lamb 
Been a chicken 
Been a pig in a pen 
Been a hand 
Been a bird 
All over again 
Been a flower 
Cut and waiting 
Just to die 
Or else for mating
