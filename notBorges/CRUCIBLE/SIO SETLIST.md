- THE WIDOW’S BOWL 
- FALLING, LEAVES 

Sharing space inside the void we tried to fill with strangers cocks 
Grindr ground us down until we found a rock where love should be 
**WE LET GO OF OUR GRIP TO BREATHE AND FINALLY SET OURSELVES FREE** 

Melt the igloo drain the lake 
Let the bathing girl awake 
Burn the monster at the stake 
Let the scathing mirror break 
BREAK
BREAK

Im so glad I have a dick 
Because I can look at it ! 
I don;’t need a man 
Because I can 
Look down and see 
The only thing I really need 
I don’t need this oestrogen 
To become the woman I know I am 
I can stand in front of this mirror 
Naked without crying 
Look how far you’ve come my darling 
Nobody can stop you now 
Except your own 
You’re not alone 
Just keep on trying 
Keep on trying 
Your womb if your bedroom 
And your children are your songs 
And your friends are your true family 
And nothing can go wrong 
Just as long as you trust all your instincts 
Never walk just to avoid the bus 
And cry at work 
And cry at shows 
And cry because you know you must 
You know you must 
Your body may give up on you 
But your spirit is inside 
The past is in the past and there’s no better place to hide
