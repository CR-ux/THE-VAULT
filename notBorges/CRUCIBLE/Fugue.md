Something got in this morning 
Crawled in the house a starving dog 
Made a home in my belongings 
Disguised itself in dust 
Something got in this morning 
An insect, bacterium, or atom 
It knocked quietly at the door 
And I let it in without a question -
It didn’t wipe its shoes off 
Or even say hello to me 

Before I’d had a chance 
To ask the something 
what it was doing here 
It had grown to seven times its size 
And was telling me of all the ways 
in which the decor was done wrong 
Swinging from mirrors 
Opening windows 
Laughing, always laughing
Letting all the cold in with it 
Pissing on the furniture 
Tearing up the cushions -
The something really knew 
How to mark its territory 

Something got in this morning
And that’s entirely my fault 
I let it in for company 
For the body warmth 
For the breath 
For a hand (any hand) 
To hold my hurting breast -
For an arm, for some armoury
Against the army in my chest
