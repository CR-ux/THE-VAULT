Callie Rose Petal is a multidisciplinary conceptual artist and experimental musician releasing recorded work under the moniker ‘lonely carp’. Her latest concept albu‘KATABASIS: an underworld opera’, funded by Help Musicians UK and her patrons, is an allegorical journey to a hell known too well by many trans* women, expressed through terrifying layers of neoclassical noise and complex mythology.m
