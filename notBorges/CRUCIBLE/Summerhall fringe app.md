Conceptual protest music that hybridises noise and neoclassical motifs, with raw, partially screamed vocals to express the visceral complexity of a lived trans* experience. 



KATABASIS: an underworld opera was supported by the Do It Differently Fund (awarded by Help Musicians UK) and is concept album curated as an allegorical descent to the underworld. The work is very dark and becomes gradually more intense as the album progresses in seven movements. The all-encompassing work of the album, created entirely underground at the dead of night in a basement studio, was inspired by my experience of survival sex - an all-too common occurrence amongst trans* women - and aims to provide a sonic approximation of my emotional tapestry during this most difficult time of my life. 



Extensive trigger/epilepsy warnings will be provided on promotional materials relating to the event, as well as on all entrances to the venue. A tiered pricing structure will allow those more able audience members to cover the difference for concessions tickets. An RSLI qualified BSL interpreter will be present for all 4 shows.
