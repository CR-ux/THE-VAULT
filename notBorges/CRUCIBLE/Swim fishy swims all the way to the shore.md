<span style="color:#000ff;">Swim fishy swims behind his locked door</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">All of his friends have gone out fishing</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">And he's left inside with the guilt and the wishing to</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Make something right</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Pants are too tight</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Take them off and turn on the light</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Spoon spoony spoon me</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">I wanna spoon you and get your hair in my teeth</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">Cause you've got a nice butt</span>
