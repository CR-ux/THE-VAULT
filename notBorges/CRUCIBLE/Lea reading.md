CENTRAL POSITION (current state of self) - The Heirophant:
Order, convention, organised religion, social structures 
Suggests you may be focused on or need to find a sense of conventional stability for growth - I think this is a reflection of your current sobriety and its importance for you 

BELOW (subconscious) - Queen of Pentacles (reversed) 
This card in reversed position suggests under the surface of your thoughts and belief systems is a need to turn inward and start giving the care to yourself that you so easily give to others (upright position) 

ABOVE (superconscious) - Page of Swords (reversed) 
This card being reversed suggests you are holding back your thoughts, whether willingly or not, either because of , or for, your current state of stability and self-growth. This card’s reversal already suggests holding one’s tongue and a reserved nature in a public forum, but in this position it absolutely shows that you are exercising diplomacy and moving though the world with as llittle resistance as possible by staying quiet in group / public settings 

BEFORE (your past) - 8 of cups 
You are moving away from withdrawal, abandonment , escapism from your self - so this may suggest that the ‘silence’ you are exercising as mentioned prior is actually more in alignment with Truth than just attackign things head on or being confrontational. 8 of cups suggests disappointment and the need to have faith in the unknown,to walk along the moonlit path , which by the plkacement of the cards it appears you are doing so , through the conventional stability & spiritual truth of the heirophant., into your future position:

AFTER (your future) - Judgement 
Judgement is about new beginnings, a new era started from letting go of something longstanding. It is the card of resurrection and awakening. You are reaching a sense of rapture and joy in the magic of Being You, free of any egoic/material bondage. A disappointing, withdrawn, neglected period of your life (denoted by 8 of cups) is coming to an absolute end , through the amalgamation of al of these energies, to bring you to a greater Authenticity than you have ever known.

This is a beautiful reading , showing the hard work you have put into your betterment, how difficult but important than work actually was, and how the hard work you have done will pay off in more significant ways than you ever could have imagined. This life is simply a string of lessons that all teach us the same thing - everything we do, feel, think, say - it’s all a vehicle for Presence. And you are more present now than you have ever been. I am so inspired by this reading and by the effort you put into said presence, and I can’t wait to see what this Judgement card brings you <3
