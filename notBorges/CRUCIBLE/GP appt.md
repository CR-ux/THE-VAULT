Exploding head syndrome -flashes of light and loud bang, painful throb in brain, elbows (DIL?), kidney pain and very frequent urination
(3 seconds or less), mucosal diarrhoea, chronic fatigue, Facial tics/muscle spasms, itching, splinter haemorrhages, very strong deja vu and vision disturbances (can see pulse in retinal blood vessels, flashing lights occasionally (usually blue but sometimes green or white) still, pain in extremities and wrist, papules on face and knuckles, always had constant really painful cramp in shins since I was about 4 years old 
There is something neurologica l and/or something autoimmune going on. 

Went to MHAS bevause of self harm urges, hallucinations, intensifying of BPD symptoms 
Got given chlorpromazine 
The mental health nurses gave me literature for the rivers centre because of trauma 
Want to stop mirtazapine, not helping anymore and probably increasing hallucinations because intense CEVs and hypnic jerks/exploding head syndrome/brain zaps have been happening since I started taking it, after images are very prevalent (feels like everything I look at is a new frame over the last until my vision gets very muddied) and peak after an hour of taking it, but worried that lower dose will increase occurrence of hallucinations
Dr young sent off a referral for secondary psychiatric services but wasn't told what this would be (I think it should be DBT) 
Read some review papers  on RCTs for the treatment of BPD, think the best course of treatment for me would be a mood stabilizer and a second generation antipsychotic, SSRIs and antidepressants in general have proven to be ineffective for me  

Tooth extraction last Wednesday led to dry socket, cocodamol ibuprofen and the chlorpromazine have led to constipation
