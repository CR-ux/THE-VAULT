Dear diary,

Hello beauties 
Above is the third episode of my radio show CONSTANTLY FAILING, which is, as you know, an audio version of my song journal. As you also know, I’m at a bit of a loss for words lately in general. I’m so grateful for the experience of making this episode, because it got my creative juices flowing again. There is very little speaking in the episode. I wanted it this one to be an exploration of silence, through noise. 
It is an hours worth of original composition, flowing from safety in static, to threat in thunderous field recordings, through tenuous tape loops and back again. 

Track listing:
UNTITLED ONE 
UNTITLED TWO (feat. sarya & maniatrix)
