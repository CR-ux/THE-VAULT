Let everything happen 
Let every resistance to every thing happen 
Let the suffering happen and the worry happen and the psychosis happen and the fear happen and don’t label any of it but if you do let the labelling happen 
Let what’s happening happen or if you can’t then let the not letting happen 
Let the letting go happen and let the not being able to let go happen and feel the tension behind your eyes happening and let the nakedness happen and let the pushing away happen and let the distance wash away all that you thought was close and let the closeness drown you in distance and let the drowning happen. And let the breathing breathe itself, or let the holding happen, let the bloodletting happen and let the drought and shrivelling happen and happen and happen and in the trough of acceptance and in the crest of fear let the waves happen, let the shining light of injustice happen and let the blindness of self-righteousness happen, let the wheel’s turning happen and let the jamming of every twig and rock and rotten veiny visage of every leaf inside every spoke of the wheel stopping the turning happen and let the sleep of it, the unknowing dreaming of it be the holy beasts which draw your carriage, surrounding and drawing out the unwavering awareness of all of it happening: the vehicle, the chariot. and let the waking up happen, with reigns in hand, eyes locked on the happening horizon- the horizon who waits for you like a patient and secret and selfless lover, who holds your heart removed from your body, the loving horizon who endlessly and silently calls you home, in the knowing that while you drive your vehicle ever closer, while you try and quit and try again, while you  dig another wheel from another wretched sump and start the axels into action again, her beckoning unceasing, while in this form, though she waits , while form has weight , though the horizon waits for your homecoming, while subjected to objectivity, though the horizon holds out her arms, while identity retains its roots in the futile dancing shadows of this dream - your reunion with the horizon can never happen. Because while on this farcical, conveyor belt stage, structured like a road, pretending to be a road, stretching out like the legs of a waking dog, telling us of a tantalising destination somehow better than where we’ve been

But the meeting will never happen 
Because the road is made up of the horizon of all which has happened, all which will happen, and all that is happening 

And most importantly, 
The scared and shaking little child of Us 
Is not the walker , or driver, or even the wheel 

The horizon is wound and packed and infinitely coiled inside every cell of our bodies made of Light 

And translates proteins into blocks of wet messy mush 
Horizontal DNA to vertical transmission
Letting thoughts happen 
Thoughts letting forms happen 
Forms letting perception happen 
Perception letting shining light happen 
Shining light letting darkness happen 
Darkness letting forgetting happen 



And the forgetting is wound into shapes 
Black lines on white, white lines on black 

Red lines scored into flesh 

Lines shaped into letters 
Letters shaped into words 
Words shaped into identity 

Sap to seed
Seed to soil 
Soil to mold 
Mold to rain 
Rain to light 
Light to root 
Root to branch 
Branch to leaf 
Leaf to fruit 
Fruit to spore 
And seed again 
And seed again 
And sacred, scared, sighing little seed again 

None of it sufficient 
All of it reaching in futility 
The reaching is the hand we reach for 

All of it an outstretched hand 
in welcoming goodbye 

Hailing a taxi that will never come 
Harking an ending ever happening 
Ushering in beginning after ending 

And allness is happening 
with such playful abandon 
Abandoning hope after fear 
Entering, Here. 


The horizon:
She draws pictures of us 
Draws carriages of us
Draws us nearer to the furthering 

In cacophonous cries 
And solitary silence 
She runs through us all 

Temperance 
Providence 
The holy hellscape unfolds from
 is held by 
digs as shovel in
the home of the hole of This Horizon 


The horizon is the happening
