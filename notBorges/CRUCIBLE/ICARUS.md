O LABYRINTH O FATHER 
ONE SHOULD MAKE AN ISLAND OF ONESELF 
AND FALL BACK INTO THE LABYRINTH 
AND FALL RIGHT BACK INTO YOUR ARMS

OH THIS DISGUSTING TRUTH 
FOUR WALLS TO HANG A ROOF 
OVER MY WEARY HEAD 
KNIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD 

WASHED UP TO WETTER SHORES 
ATHENA OF THE NORTH 
TISSUE TO DRY YOUR MOUTH 
FISSURE OF THE SOUTH 

ICARUS GOT NOTHING ON US NOW
