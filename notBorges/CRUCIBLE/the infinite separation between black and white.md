permalink: the infinite separation between black and white
---
Tightening your quiet strings 
To play your song of shame 
And see the stare it brings 

Lightening your spirits wings 
To fly away from sorrow 
But they’ve all got their own things 
And their time you can’t borrow 
You made tears lose their meaning 
With every promised tomorrow 

Caught in a spiral of infinite fractals 
I close my eyes put my heart in a satchel 
And boldly leave the house 

You pass this wisdom onto your cute baby 
And I’ll pass this wisdom around 
You share this wisdom with your little babies
And I’ll take it with me to the ground
You can make peace with the fact that I loved you 
Can’t kiss it together or stick it with glue 
And there is nobody alive who can kiss it any better 
There is nobody alive who can hold this together 

I will try not to cut myself 
And I will try not to pollute my brain 
But I can’t find a part of myself 
That I can look at with love again 

I am trying to be kinder 
To myself 
I am trying I am TRYING 
I AM TRYING 


Don’t look at me that way 
In the mirror 
I really hate you sometimes 
More than anyone else 
For you have hurt me 
More than anyone ever could 

Trying so hard not to worsen 
Try to be a different person 
Try to be right here on Earth son 
We didn’t raise you for this 

No it isn’t your job 
No it isn’t your love 
Or lack or want Thereof
It’s always been there 
Right down inside the fractal edge 


Strangling histones 
Your Genes can’t be silenced anymore
Throwing stones 
At the pain of glass at your front door 
to beat the pain is to know what it’s for 
        
We are all watching 
We are all within 
Oh G, 
Oh A, 
Oh T, 
Oh C, 
We see your clutching 
We see all your sin

How many selves can I juggle 
To make sure that I am liked
And Who is 
the jugg
ler 

How many times will I struggle 
To find company at night 
And who is the juggler 

How much light inside a puddle 
Is forbidden from my sight
And who is the juggler 

Are any selves left to juggle 
That I do not yet despise 
And will I ever be the juggler 

A big black umbrella 
Walking past the window 
we used to look out of 
It’s time to be alone
it’s time to be alone

“Explosive anthem riff” 
I wanted you to see the me I can’t 
Asking you to play the hardest part 
In a play that no-one paid to see 
In a city from which we longed to be free 

All the monsters trapped inside our house 
Couldn’t help but scream to be let out 


——-
This is cabaret trash garbage
——-
I will stop pretending I am cis 
When I find a bigger dick than his 
Then I can die a happy woman 

I can go on with this boy charade 
For as long as it takes me to get laid 
By a man with a grander slammer 

You don’t know what it takes 
To not put makeup on my face 
And treat corridors like a runway 

Well you’ll see, see one day 
That I’m not just a gay 
Once I find the right membership 
To a club with no pay
