Hello lovely people,
 
I’m an experimental artist based in Edinburgh, releasing my concept album (KATABASIS) supported by Help Musicians UK’s prestigious ‘Do It Differently’ fund this November. 
The album launch is happening at Edinburgh’s August_21, in a bespoke and immersive event held in the basement, but I am in the process of organising a miniature UK tour for the release. As the in-house composer for the Spit It Out collective, I tested out performing the album live at the first show back since we were awarded charity status. The performance was so well received that I thought I would reach out to venues, where the intensity and scope of the music can be properly heard and appreciated over a PA. 
The album is an allegorical descent to the underworld, veiling a mysterious and terrifying chronicle of what it means to be a trans* woman going through survival sex (doing sex work for rent, groceries, to survive).
Combining orchestral motifs, pitch shifted screamed vocals and elements of noise/power electronics together, the album becomes darker and more abrasive with each track, before returning to a place of heartbreaking serenity in the final song. I am a classically trained pianist, and so the piano acts as the central vehicle for the hellish journey.
Obviously performing in an intimate bedroom setting with a single amp didn’t quite do the sonics justice, but I hope you can see from the below video the energy and darkness that the evening will involve - moving in amongst the crowd and interacting with them much more than a traditional set.

I like to call the music “orchestral noise” or “death cabaret” as it is at once fragile, intimate, and shockingly explosive.

Let me know if you’d be interested in hosting the KATABASIS show - the evening will be a dark, theatrical performance, and with Spit It Out and our connections across the country, I know we’d get a great turnout!

Best wishes, 
Callie Rose Petal
