Love is a scathing mirror 
If I would never treat the one I love like this 
Why on earth would I treat myself like this 
Why am I so fucking nasty to myself 
Why am I so fucking nasty to myself 


It’s in the letting go 


My longing is for the words 
that will come, 
and in their arriving, 
arrest 
all heretofore 
incessant thought. 
Clearing ballrooms, 
stadiums, 
basement 
broom closets. 


My longing is for 
the words that won’t ever come, 
who in their arriving, 
might render all 
the other words, 
once said 
or to be heard, 
meaningless. 


My longing is for the words 
that have left me, 
to return to my mouth, 
silencing 
all their echoes in memory 
My longing 
is for the words to come, 
Swaddle us in silent rapture
To gently kiss us on the head 
And smell like coming home 
And make me long for all the words 
to leave,
  and take my longing with them
