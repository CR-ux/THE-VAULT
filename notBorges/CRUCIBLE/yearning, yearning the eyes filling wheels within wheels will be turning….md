YEARNING, YEARNING: the eyes filling wheels within wheels will be turning around and around
1. We shall not cease from Murmuration (and the end of all our exploring)
2. homecoming queen forever (persephone’s hymn)


Drown other sounds round robin more gentle/grapdual fade in & more layers of harmony 
Cut Gong at drop, add different texture 
Decrease gain of ‘drum’ at end 
Decrease chain gain 






1. I feel it in there, I feel something growing in there (demeter’s emptiness)

[Add concertina?]
Align ‘hurts like hell to touch’ 
Decrease vocalisation @ ~1:30


Add more organ? To “something growing in my heart” onwards

1. yearning, yearning (how much I long to be free) 

[Drown out the sound 
Drown other sounds you might hear 
Deny the light 
Lay ye sight upon no tear 
Surrender love 
And beginnings you dream of 
Of this end I won’t be scared
The answer to my prayers 
Deny the light 
Was born to deny the light 
Never, ever give it all away 
Lay ye sight upon no tear 
Your mother’s not welcome here 
Turning 
Her 
Other 
Ear ]


1. Cross-threaded heart screw burning (hades’ surrender) 

The deepest part of my stilling heart still tells me safety isn't safe, it cannot be, that love has a price, it has to, that light will always lie behind a veil of darkness. But now I surely step forward, into the sucking void of self forgiveness, with the crippling courage that has been, with or without my willingness, placed as thorns upon my head. I leap into terrifying Love with unwavering faith that the fragments of selfhood I still hold onto may keep me afloat, through the valley of the shadow of Death, through the shedding of all that keeps me from experiencing the fullness of Being.
And may these words of become a David-pebble and soar, and soar, and resonate, and clatterclang and trickle down and strike the eye in the eye of the head in the head of the Goliath-algorithm:
In the End
All tangents must converge
The edge becoming centre this body, my humble body of work;
A sacred future ne'er to be known
By anything, but-
a screw in the cog 'round a well oiled axel of a function of exactly that
which surrounds our bodies now
And if you wish to speak aloud, then say it with me; scream it:
may these words, my words, my inmost seed of sweet intention, the Love that gnaws and grows and creaks to bend about my thinking- may it all swaddle me and swallow me, devour me in blissful flame, grow perennial fruit in blistering certain wisdom and through shuddering cold of ignorance. and may it crumple every Fear still felt by the gently whimpering little child I have so often silenced, who simply begs to be as Loved as she once loved the magick of this world. and hold her. and hold her up to the rotating Light. and hold her with me always in the centre. never to be left alone, or weeping in her bed again.

Bring trumpets down to allow Vox to be heard more

1. Will be to arrive where we started (and know the place for the first time)
Change pitch of chitty sample

Homecoming (persephone’s hymn) 

Drown out the sound 
(Drown out the sound )
Drown other sounds you might hear  (Drown out the loudness of fear)
Deny the light  (Deny the light)
Lay sight upon not a tear 
(Lay sight upon not a tear)
Your mother’s not crying
(Your mother’s not crying)
She knows that you’re dying to be here 
(She knows that you’re dying to be here)



She knows you’re dying
