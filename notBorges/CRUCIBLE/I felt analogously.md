<span style="color:#000ff;">Like I was floating in mid air</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">But air like water</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Thick and viscous</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Because I am balancing on my life's on knife edge</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">That's what I chose to do</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">And that's</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Fucking</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Okay</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">I thought I could read your mind</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Don't mind me collecting souls and placing them in pots I bought from the charity shop</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">To</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">For</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">change</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">I hate feeling like my mum crying on the fence but  most of all I hate feeling like my dad did like I missed the joke at my own expense</span>
