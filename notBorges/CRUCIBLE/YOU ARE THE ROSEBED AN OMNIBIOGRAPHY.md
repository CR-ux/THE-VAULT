permalink: YOU ARE THE ROSEBED AN OMNIBIOGRAPHY
---
By Calyx Rose Petal



This is my attempt to put words to the indescribable. The concepts contained within this text are already understood by you. Sometimes the semantics may be paradoxical, sometimes the sentence structure seemingly disorganised, but it is only through abstraction of thought that we may begin to deconstruct thought itself, to be fully in the Self. 
For you see, you are not your thoughts. You are not your experiences. You are not the things you think, say or do. These things may be tools for uncovering the real, ever present you, but the you is not contained within. Much like a scientist disrupts the natural state of a system in order to understand its normal function, you too can use your sensory, emotional and cognitive inputs to understand the space in which these things occur. Surrounding every sound, silence. An archetypally feminine, receptive space of No-sound. Encasing every light, darkness. An ungendered feminine, receptive space of No-light. And at the illusory boundary of every Thing, Nothing. A fundamentally feminine, receptive space of No-Thing. And that’s you.



All that exists is now. 
We that I exist as one. 
One is all that exists. 
All that exists is one. 
Now is all that is one. 

The cup does not empty without first being filled. 
You need knowledge to relinquish it. 
Need ignorance to overcome it.
Your whole life has been spent gathering knowledge so that you can learn how to let it go.
The more you learn, the more you can unlearn. 

All religious texts have been interpreted with the mind. Worse, the collective mind.

Any words you may read or hear, including these ones, are ghostly carriages, drawn by phantom horses we are taught to rear. Much like wave particle duality, everything you perceive is altered by the act of perception. So try to feel beneath these words as you perceive them. Know in your unknowing. 


[Thick, thorned branch being pulled through my centre 

I understood what the fear of god was then] 

The fear of my own power 

Once you understand your own power, things are no longer done to you, they occur within you and from you. 

The fear of God is the fear of responsibility of feeling. 

Once you are awake, you can no longer place blame or wish things to be different. Once you are awake, you realise you have always been the architect of your own dream space. Once you are awake, the only real death is going back to sleep. 

Life may be described as the opposite of a joke.
The more you try to understand it, the less funny it becomes
The less you try to understand it, the harder it is not to laugh.

	Once I had addressed my chronic pain body, shed light upon it by being conscious of it, my ego started to manifest my pain body externally, as self neglect. 



	Know in your unknowing.

	The reason you feel lack is because there are others in the world who perceive themselves as lacking. 

	A vehicle is sufficient, but not necessary 

	Every rose has its thorn - each positive thought contains the negative, each negative thought contains the positive. 
	A positive thought comes with egoic bias - the assumption that this thought, this desire, this emotion is somehow better than the state of simply being. For example, to think “I am happy” is to come from a state of unhappiness, and is to dissolve back into unhappiness once more. This is of course true, due to the transience of everything. A so-called negative thought, such as “I am not good enough” is only a half truth. The only truth in that sentence lies in the first two words. Anything that follows “I am” is simply an illusion. 

	A rosebed does not judge its roses, or its lack thereof. It simply lays there, still, soaking up sunlight or absorbing rain, throughout it all. A rosebed does not fear death or decay. In fact, a rosebed understands, without thinking, that death and decay are contained within it, nourishing new life. 

	Time is the ultimate illusion, and events are occurring all at once. Deja vu is a glimpse into the non-linearity of time. Deja vu is a divine revelation, in that it amalgamates two supposedly separate “now”s into one, thus offering a fraction of insight into the ultimate truth that all is now.

	You are now, now, you were now, then, and you will be now, forever. 

	our perception of objects entering the event space is drip-fed, because we currently inhabit bodies limited in their biology. 
	There is a reason even for this limitation. Limitation to the art brings freedom to the artist. A design brief is immeasurably easier to follow than searching for inspiration from infinite possibility. At our essence we are pure potential, but growth cannot perceive itself without its polar opposite - resistance. An object must be surrounded by space to grow into. The masculine imposing, the feminine allowing. A direct route that does not cover every point on a map is not seen as lacking, so why are our physical bodies seen as such? 

	For some reason I have come to understand that I do not need to understand nor should I, I was assigned a body perceived as male. For some reason I know in my unknowing, the world must perceive me at face value as male. For some reason I am sure of in my nescience, perhaps the most important part of my physical journey on earth is overcoming perception. Perhaps this is why I was drawn to the arts; a way to hold and mould perception.

	It was important in the shuffling of the cosmic cards for me to identify so strongly with feminine energy that I discovered my own fundamental infinity, the same infinity as yours. A sacred spring that runs far beneath the jutting rocks of the constructed and programmed mind that invented gender. That needs gender to understand duality. That needs duality to understand unity. 

Sit. Just sit. Comfortably. Focus on the sensation of the breath through the nostrils as you close your eyes. Now, feel your hand. Feel how it feels. Observe it inside your head, hold space for any reactions that may arise within you, but don't judge. Just note all the possible sensations on the outside, and more importantly on the *inside* of your hand. feel your own awareness inside the hand; how does the awareness itself feel? Asking yourself this question has brought you out of your mind and into a higher, yet somehow deeper, level of consciousness. Let this awareness grow to your forearm and bring the awareness *of* the awareness with it. What does it feel like in there? What hijinks is the ego getting up to, in a futile attempt to survive? Are there uncomfortable bodily sensations arising from your own stillness? This is A manifestation of the ego, that again, is not you. Acknowledge its presence. Hold the space for any and all sensations that may arise as a result of your awareness, and by shining awareness upon them, they will lose their power over you. By acknowledging their presence and truly feeling them, you have also acknowledged that you are the space in which these sensations arise, therefore far more enduring. Try to hold this bodily awareness as it spreads to all of your limbs, your chest, your head, neck, torso, everywhere. If thoughts come, just gently bring the awareness back to your bodily sensations, using the breath as an anchor to the Now. Never any judgement, never any frustration at the self, the act of even trying is sacred.

Now open your eyes and regard the space you are in.
If you felt an incredible and indescribable stillness at any point during that meditative practice, you have been given a glimpse of what I mean when I say consciousness. 
The Way as referred to in Taoism is the source of this type of consciousness. Pure consciousness. the Way, engenders One;
One is a truth you know deeper than anything. One engenders Two;
Two is the divine conversation. Two engenders Three; God comes from and IS consciousness. The so-called Godhead (the part of god within you) is consciousness. Life on earth is consciousness. 
This is the holy trinity. This is the Three. And Three engenders all things.
