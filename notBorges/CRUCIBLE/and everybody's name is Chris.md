<span style="color:#000ff;">Quick you haven't been high for like 10 minutes</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">I want cookies or something</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">I don't want to wash these mugs</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">I want someone near to me</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">To love and stuff and stuff</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">Stop caring so much</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">Don't talk so much</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Be okay with yourself</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">And such and such</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">You'll be coming home so soon you won't even know you ever left</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Artie said YOU'RE STILL NOT DEAD stop focusing on death</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Looking back's not looking back it's tilting to the side</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">The past is in the past and there's no better place to hide</span>
