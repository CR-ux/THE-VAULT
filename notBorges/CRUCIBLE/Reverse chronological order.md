I dreamt my school/uni friends wanted to have a foursome with me but I ran away and ended Up sleeping with Elton John and his dick was huge but the condom kept coming off and there were people I knew outside laughing and talking and inside they were taking down the set from a play I was supposed to be helping with
 I dreamt of a pattern that wasn't possible when I tried to recreate it awake: There were petals that came fromthe heads of everybody on earth arranged in a circle that got more and more infinitely connected

Now they look like angels 

Somebody from primary school was in my dream in a "commuter's taxi" with seats that hung off the sides of a tgolf cart - I wanted o call him Micah but he only went to our school in reception 
He was talking about a double swing ride that takes you all the way over until you inflate with air and pop, and you turn inside out and back to front infinitely again and again 
A woman with a short haircut was a healthcare professional who told me I would be on mirtazapine for the rest of my life and I was upset about it 
She said - do you expect physical illness to just go away without treatment? 
I said "I guess not..." but now I'm awake and realise the body can heal itself so why can't the mind?
Something else happened before this 
Something with a paddling pool that somebody screamed "there's piss in here" and a jumper and Eventually I walked out of that house and made my way to the taxi rank but I was being chased by chav teenagers I got scared but then there was my south Asian primary school friend who was angry at me for not recognising or remembering him and asking his name.
