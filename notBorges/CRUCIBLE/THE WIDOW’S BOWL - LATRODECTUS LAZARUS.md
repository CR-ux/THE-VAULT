THE WIDOW'S BOWL 

My art is a sickness 
A madness 
A cracked bowl of a dream 
And the artifice 
Of a tight squeeze 
As if somehow 
Someone 
might be
Holding in my mesentery 
Keeping all my organs in 

I live as a window 
Into others lives
Teaching them lessons
About light 
how it touches 
Every disgusting thing 

And I Am 
The ten thousand disgusting things 
No soft light shall touch 
So give me thy harshness!
Thy abrasion!
Rebuke my very eyes!
With almighty brilliance 

I exist as an afterthought 
A plaything
A paycheque to be spent -
Demons make their deals with me 
I curl up, foetal in their burlap sacks
To dangle from their burning hips
Again, they say:
To create 
You (in your entirety)
must destroy 
Every single thing
To leave a trace behind  -
And so I rise to evil’s banquet 
In a discharge of awareness 
My face contained in a silver cloche 
An honoured guest 
and ingredient 


I live as a widow. 
Being:
a fickle, prickly thing 
Hingeing on a swinging door -
Trust 
Encrusted in fear 
Rusted with fallacious apathy
And whittled by chisels 
Into visages of femininity 
That might capture men
As winged statues 
Quivering on the dewy ropes 
I pull from out of me 
Strings of Violins, violas
a cello, a double bass 
And the web of dirges dance 
In the mandibles of silence 

I devour my love 
And wonder where it's gone 

And there are months, years, 
Feasting on my own fat stores
Maintaining the integrity of my weaving 
Sleeping with seven eyes open 
Thinking of the fragile structure i might leave behind
The tenuous and beautiful strands 
Divine architecture hiding 
like a beaten child
in the plainest of sight 


God I am hungry 
and praying 
to be remembered 
I am knowing 
All we can hope for our bodies 
Is that they may fill other bodies
In consummation 
Or consumption 

And so,
I devour myself - 

Bitter;
Pungent;
Unpalatable; 
I was not made to be eaten 
I was born, into death, as a machine 
As a broken vessel
A churning roundabout 
A madness, sickness -
A cracked
And empty
bowl 
of a dream
