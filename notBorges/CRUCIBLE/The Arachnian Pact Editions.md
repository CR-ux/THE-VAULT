23 VERY limited editions of KATABASIS: an underworld opera.

cthonic objects, each a knot in the Silver Cord.
Accompanying liner notes and samples from personal magickal notebooks scratched, burned, and consecrated in blood during lunar ritual on the 23 days preceding the Third anniversary of the completion of the work of KATABASIS. 

1-6 to be scattered across magickal sites of the UK, hidden in a fibonacci web.

7 - 12 to be donated to forge’s mark patrons who are to be collaborators in the next layer of the labyrinth.

13 - 23 are available to purchase on band camp, my website, and via the merch tab of my Spotify page, priced to reflect what is born of sacrifice. Please do not enter into such a pact without considering the ramifications of opening the secrets of such an artefact. 








An incredibly eschatologically limited run of 23 art-editions of *KATABASIS: an underworld opera*, each forged through a series of 23 rituals, performed one per night in the lead-up to the third year following the completion of the infernal work. These objects are imbued with chthonic energy, created not just by hand but through the channeling of forces far beyond the self. 

Each edition acts as both a clew and a Gordian knot in the Silver Cord—a personally, and, try as I might to contain, suppress or claim ownership of it, universally metaphysical lifeline woven through the labyrinthine tapestry of my discographic crucible and as may well soon be brought to light, the fabric of reality itself. The Silver Cord, in this context, connects not only the physical world to the underworld as conceptually forged through the movements of the debut, and final/only ever physical release under the lonely carp moniker, (signifying an Unanswered Question of a narrative  a descent missing its canonical, Anabatic counterpart) but also binds together ritual acts,  and cosmic truth, whispering secrets that may or may not be revealed to those who dare.

These objects are cthonic artifacts in the truest sense, embodying the liminal space between life and death, chaos and order, offering initiates a glimpse into the abyss. Yet, they demand sacrifice—of time, energy, and spirit. Those courageous enough to engage with these pieces will find themselves enmeshed in the unfolding threads of a narrative that may either illuminate or devour the self.

Each object is unique, embodying a moment of ritual and the blood-sacrifice that went into its creation. Whether the secrets within will be fully unlocked remains up to the bearer’s own willingness to confront what lies beyond the veil, tethered to the world by the Silver Cord, yet always on the precipice of severance.
