GONNA SHOVE QUEER IN YOUR FACE 
LETS PUT POP MUSIC IN ITS PLACE 
AND SHRED ELECTRIC DOUBLE BASS 


For ages i have been wanting to disrupt the idea of a club night, merging my angry performance art with live noise, platforming trans* artists, shredding electric double bass in accompaniment, bringing ABRASION to the club. That night is happening at @sneakypetesclub 21st jan, with @sounds_of_ogigia as part of @aquelarre_nights.
