	The Underworld Tour will have six in person dates and culminate in a livestream for the seventh and final event of the tour. Throughout the tour, Patreon subscriptions will be collected by my team (comprised of my manager and other members of Spit It Out), with exclusive patron-only stickers given to those signing up. I will use crowd cast for the livestream, which has Patreon integration so a subscription paywall can be set up. The following venues have all agreed to host the show, and there is flexibility for each date within the month they fall in:
	May 7th: Assembly Roxy, Edinburgh
	June 18th: 13th Note, Glasgow
	July 12th: Banshee Labyrinth, Edinburgh
	August: Fringe show run at Summerhall (*4 shows)
	September: Admin & Marketing month (organising livestream props and setup, promoting final in-person show and the livestream itself) 
	October 29th: August_21 
	November 19th: Patron-only livestream hosted on crowdcast.

	A yearâ€™s subscription to crowd cast is 240 USD (175.50 GBP), meaning once I have signed up in October ahead of the November show (on the anniversary of the digital release of the album), I will be able to host monthly patron-only livestreams. This will provide an ongoing increase in my Patreon following once the physical tour is complete; representing perhaps the most important aspect of this project, as my Patreon page is the cornerstone of my practice, where fans can directly support my work in its rawest and most uncensored form.
