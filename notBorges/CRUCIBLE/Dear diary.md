[INTRO]
[NOISE COMPOSITION]
Nobody wants to wake from a pleasant dream. 
My peace came from within the noise of the earth 
I only found light in the middle of darkness.
The realest, truest You there is can never be threatened,  measured or named.
The only thing that unites us, our ability to perceive the current moment, is the only real thing there is.      
Close your eyes, 
Can you see it?
You are not your thoughts. You are not your experiences. You are not the things you think, say or do. 
These things may be tools for uncovering the real, ever present you, but the you is not contained within. 
Much like a scientist disrupts the natural state of a system in order to understand its normal function, you too can use your sensory, emotional and cognitive inputs to understand the space in which these things occur.
Surrounding every sound, silence. 
[SILENCE]
An archetypally feminine, receptive space of No-sound. 
Can you hear it?
Encasing every light, darkness. 
An ungendered feminine, receptive space of No-light. 
Breathe in.
Breathe out.
Can you feel it?
[OST STARTS AGAIN]
And at the illusory boundary of every Thing, Nothing. 
A fundamentally feminine, receptive space of No-Thing.
[SILENCE]
That is consciousness in its purest form.
That’s you.
That's where you are. 
Everywhere you'll never go.
Everywhere you've always been.
There you are. 


Pain can be a way into presence. 
Noise can be a way into silence. 

[SONGS]

And my heart feels broken.
But the heart of hearts can never break.
And a broken heart becomes an opening.
an ovum is an exit
the heart a creaking gate
opened on a closing pulse
formidably too late
You see, you see, you see, you see the more you see the more the darkness will try to cover you. The more you try the more wearied your arms will become. The more light you project, the more the shadows of yourselves and others enclose their grip upon you. The seed of nothing, in the flower of everything. the shoot of everything, from the root of nothing.
