Cucumber based 
Java spring backend 
OpenAI specs 
YAML
JSON

A lot to learn in first instance 
2 areas: functional; regression 

Functional: 
Getting APIs running against predefined OpenAI specs (swagger) 
Mock server - validate for correct data type/minmax length boundary testing 

Regression:
Much deeper 
Spring layer 
Spinning up reference application 
Taking specific reqs and firing them as JSON payload against API to validate it maps returns everything expected 

Modules sit behind Apis return and process null values / handling errors 
Splitting out expected 

Boundary testing; fully validated 


Project completion mid august 

193 APIs 



function Foo() {}
var foo = new Foo();

typeof Foo;             // == "function"
typeof foo;             // == "object"
foo instanceof Foo;     // == true
foo.constructor.name;   // == "Foo"
Foo.name                // == "Foo"    
Foo.prototype.isPrototypeOf(foo);   // == true
