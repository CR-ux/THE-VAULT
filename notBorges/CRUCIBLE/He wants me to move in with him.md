And now he’s going to the gym 
I think he wants to murder me 
I know my statistics well 
In this patricjarchal hell 
I think he wants to murder me 
I know the statistics Jill 
Biweekly English men will kill 
Their girlfriend wife or sweetie 
But in this world we all get fucked 
By imbalance of power called luck 
The men are also suffering 
It’s because gender was invented 
By the ego we cling to intensely 
But we really must let go so gently 
AnAd dissolve into life’s unity 
I wasn’t born as the right gender 
In fact my culture my gender doesn’t exist 
But we are all made up of mass equating to energy 
The masculine seed of the femininefruit 
The undying tree will grow branches in fractals 
And all of the time we spend never will end 
Because time is a construct just like gender 
We use to make sense of a spirit we can’t comprehend
And that very spirit is living inside of us 
It presents itself inside the things we all love 
And it sang so loudly when I came to see my friends

I thought I was in heaven just being next to them 
And then they surprised me and took us camping in a 
Beautiful yurt in a forest of trees 
And I cried when we got there because they all saw me 
They see who I am and it’s such a gift just to be seen 




Kurtis is building the fire to keep us warm 
Each stick placed with love and so carefully picked 
I miss him so much now he’s living so far away  
Jane cuts the cake and looks after us all 
Harry drove us to this place like he drives the love flowing and growing so tall and branching between us and he saved me life more times than  MJ is dancing we’Re dancing together it feels like forever since I saw her last and i

Her favourite people in the world 
And this unbelieving grAteful girl 
Are camping in between the trees
I thought I’d already reached heaven 
Just being able to see them again
