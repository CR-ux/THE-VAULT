<span style="color:#000ff;">Me you and friends from my fight</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">My eyelids took all the light</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">And you kissed them in the bathtub</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">We tried to sneak past them sleeping</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">But we could stop ourselves laughing</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">You held my hands so tight</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">I could have sworn you were by my side</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Love</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">In the club</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Where you backed me up</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">When I said I couldn't swim</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">But they all knew better tried to push me under so we ran away and where did you end up</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">I found myself back in hell</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">The place that i knew so well</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">And tried so hard to forget the regret</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Because without it you'd never have kissed my head</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Kiss your best place to rest</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">Caffeine and cigarette life</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Is teetering by the wayside</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Waves lap over the gondola</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Threatening to consume us</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">I'll just keep punting us along</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Just sit there and smoke from your handblown glass bong I want to climb inside your ribcage and escape the endless rat race they're killing them all with poison too strong</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">And nothing I do now will make them think they belong</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Waking up in pain now</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">The only way I know how</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">My friend is a friend of god and he must have stopped praying that I could sleep soundly without your nose whistling next to my elbow</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Oh</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">How twisted I am</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Intestinal tug of war man</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Oh</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Hope you'll understand</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">I'm an asshole but I'll always be your right hand</span>
