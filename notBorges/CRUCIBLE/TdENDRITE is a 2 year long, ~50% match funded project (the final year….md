TdENDRITE is a 2 year long, ~50% match funded project (the final year of which this Open Fund application covers) with 23% guaranteed funding in place already from the following sources.

Projected income from 2021 vinyl/CD/digital record sales (£6,000) [RS]
250*vinyls pressed, 150*CDs made from DID fund, 100% profit due to grant funding
Assuming 200 record sales; 200*£25=£5000
Assuming 100 CD sales; 100*10=£1000
Projected first year income from this work (£8,024) [IN]
	Rough estimates from research [for the purposes of this plan, relative to the majority of my audience location, only UK & US populations have been taken into account]
TAM (Total Available Market): 
400M streaming service users 2020; streaming growing by approx. 20% PA (448M by 2021); 65.2% global population is 15-64 (292M); upward trend for classical/ambient due to COVID (0.6 – 0.7 normalised mean); 22.5% of 16-25 year olds paid to download music (MRC DATA); between 56-78% of users use social media/apps to listen to music according to IFPI (International Federation of the Phonographic Industry – Music Listening 2019).
SAM (Serviceable Available Market): 
US population 16-25 = 12%; UK population 16-25 = 8.9%. Average = 10.45%. 10.45% of 448M = 46,816,000
SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market): 
22.5% of 46,816,000 = 10,533,600. 56% of 10,533,600 = 5,898,816
Assuming 0.1% of SOM purchase one (£3) output in first year = income 5,900. Assuming 0.1% of SOM follow one social channel = 5,900 online audience growth in first year. Assuming 0.01% of SOM = 590 audience growth.
