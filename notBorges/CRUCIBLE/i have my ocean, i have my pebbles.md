i have my flower girl and a sweet devil sent from heaven 
i have me too
i suppose i have me to 
i'm gonna have me real soon 
i  have no idea 
where my life is going
but i know i want to go there with all of you
i remember when you guys played scrabble with me all night so i didn't die you are the best friends i've ever had
i wanted this song to have drums 
so you can hear the way my heart pounds
so full of love and life and everything
a handful of stars that you can wrap your arms around
 
 
 
 
scotland saved my life twice
karl on the pedalo
done with people who are done with me
 
 
lauren's new groove
 
sister, remember
the times me and you spent together 
we've got so many steps and no banister 
just like the damaged things you've kept
i will love you even when i have no love left 
just like the damaged things you've kept
i will love you even when i have no love left
get out get out get out get out
give the emperor something new to groove about
run lauren run
see what you become 
if all else fails let's put some cartoons on 
guess you'll always be five and ill always be one
guess you'll always be five and i'll always be one
guess we'll always have fights but we'll always be one 



A major D minor throughout


you make me sick
you make me sick and i can't stand this anymore
you make me sick you make me sick you make me sick you make me sick i slept on the floor
you make me sick
you make me sick i can't stand this anymore
you make me sick you make me sick
you made me sleep on the floor
