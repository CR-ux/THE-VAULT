I always knew 
That you 
We're rejecting me 
I always knew 
That they 
Didn't want me at their party 
I always knew 
That my cells couldn't 
House this crowd 
I always knew 
That my anti-Body 
Was rejecting me 

My very skin is breaking loose
They could not hear the things 
It said
My very bones are aching 
From the inside 
Out of bed 

Listen to xiu xiu 
Pretend someone could love you 
Listen to Fiona 
And dream they knew the half 
Of it 
Listen to Joanna 
Pretend someone could love you 
Listen to anonhi 
And dream they knew the half of it 

you punch new holes 
in your belt 
every goddamn day 
you punch new holes 
in your heart 
every goddamn second
and you will prove your lack of worth again 
and again 
until 
completely surrounded by a reflective surface
your hatred is sated with whom which you have mated

Did my brain develop
Like a rectal cavity 
Giving way 
To something 
Getting out 
Did my heart not resemble
a clump of hair to be pulled out of a shower drain 
the leftovers of every person who has seen me naked 

The tightest ball is waiting for a dream 
Before her bony spotty rotten head explodes 
Time is always stretching just enough 
Like you stretch me 
Pain is a commodity 
Pleasure is an afterthought 
Rhyme is raping poetry 
Sticking fingers down your throat

I came here for the fog 
TO WATCH IT BLANKET OVER EVERYTHING 
This whole thing is a metaphor for something that sounds too pretentious for me to feel comfortable writing it down or saying it aloud

I am trying to calculate 
Whether it would be worse 
To be killed on the street for being dressed like me
Or to not be looked at 
Or noticed at all 
even my own body 
won’t buy what it’s celling 
just became vessels within vessels 
to contain pints of hell in
