To Whom It May Concern,

I, Callie Rose Petal, hereby confirm that my friend Kyle Broadhurst has been residing with me at Flat 3/1, 167 Langside Road, Glasgow. 
Kyle and I have a shared living arrangement where he contributes to the household expenses as follows:

- Rent: £715 per month, split equally (£357.50 each per month)
- Council Tax: £145 per month, split equally (£72.50 each per month)
- Internet: £26.99 per month, split equally (£13.50 each per month)
- Energy Costs: £76 per month, split equally (£38 each per month)

These expenses are divided evenly between us, reflecting Kyle's half share of the total household costs. 
Kyle has been living at this address as of May 2024, and this arrangement has been ongoing without issue.
