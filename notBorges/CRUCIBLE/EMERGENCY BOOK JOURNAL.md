EMERGENCY BOOK JOURNAL

Use REAL LIFE EXPERIENCE to inspire SURREALIST novel
A character who discovers a magical item to change their gender 
Being used and hurt and ostracised and raped 

Record ALL DREAMS and eventually compile into a book with a map 


My body never felt like a prison until I had the idea of what it might like to be free 



Scene with child self 
“Did you miss me?” / “do you remember me?”
“I try not to” - crying, hugging 

EVERYONE HAS ONE SENSE BECAUSE THEY HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT THEY ARE EACH OTHER 



Excessive joy and perpetual longing share the same root: a futile desire, an unquenchable will to escape the thunderous simplicity of Being. 
At first, simply Being is the scariest thing, for it is the Only thing. And so we create and cultivate escape routes, drugs, unhealthy sex, excessive exercise, over-identification with intellect, self-harm in all its forms, ego identifications that are in actuality prison cells we stick our heads into like Ostriches, deluding ourselves that we are somewhere else for a little while. Being is shared by us all. This is threatening to our sense of who we are, and our geography in the Universe. If we open our hearts, our lack of specialness does not need to be scary. It can be expansive. The worker bee’s lifespan is dwarfed by the overall life of the hive. The wave in the ocean does not give thought to its own dissolution; the tides come in, and they go out. 

This is us, as every single drop of water returning to the ocean.

LAUREN’S BDAY SONG:

PRIVATE JOKES- 
- @You make me smile from Nureah to ear@
- beanie baby holidays that never got off the plane




Lauren’s NEW GROOVE! (boom: baby)
on this day 29 years ago 
you grew from the roots below 
a single bay leaf sprouting through 
a spirit surrounded by june
sister, remember
the times me and you spent together 
now our steps go up and wind 
but now they’re easier to climb
and when i couldn’t use my legs 
you helped me down each step 
we’ve been best friends for so long 
since way back when you called me mr pop along 
sitting down on each ledge 
sitting down on the stage 
you’ve always been the patient one 
i’ve always been the crazy one 
that’s how it worked, that’s how it does 
i’m in the rain and you bring the sun 
shining vibrant yellow, Lauren 

just like the damaged things you kept
i will love you even when i have no love left 
do you remember when we were so young and so so scared 
when it got dark and we were in the bunk beds 
our imaginations were a lever activated trapdoor 
looking back i wonder what we had that lever for 
being with you takes me to the child inside 
you remind me that they are still there 
without a worry, not a care 
for lists of commitments as long as my hair 
you take me to the inner place 
a long forgotten safe space
where really can just be 
and all the stolen moments 
so treasured, they were free 
every crab we caught 
and let back into the sea 
was a little bit of you 
and a little bit of me 
Shiva and Shakti 
yang to Yin 
Black and White 
Virtue and Sin 
masculine 
feminine 
Dusk and Dawn 
chuffed, forlorn 
we hold them both 
inside each other 
in the double helix 
of sister and brother 

While I was a germinating seed 
you were a sapling laurel tree 
growing just in front, to my right 
you didn’t want to block my light 
but underground we were connected 
your roots surrounded me, protected 
everything i was and everyone i would become 
and now I am a willow tree standing with you in the sun
and then we went to school and then we went to different schools and then you went to university and then i moved out of home and then we both got our own places with our partners and then i moved away to scotland to do science things and then your kind and loyal gardener and you had rings and then i really missed you and wished i had treasured the time more when all i could see through were windows not doors, and i hoped that one day we’d all live here in edinburgh maybe but then you bought a house and then another and Boom, baby! 
and now my little nephew bean 
he is growing in the belly 
that got so many butterflies 
on your first day of school 
when i was still a baby
just like yours will be so soon 
life really has come circling 
and i can’t wait to play beanie baby holidays that never quite get off the plane with your baby with my baby nephew who I’ll truly love to watch him bloom like the stick on flowers you had in your room and i want to tell the truth about how his mummy is the world how she’s the reason that i’m here and even if I’m not that near i’ll lend my ear every second just to make sure that he’s heard and his mum as a wee girl made me into the cool person that i am and understand that your mum always holds her hand out i          can’t wait until you take your little baby to the place we used to play on the swings and tell each other all the things and in that very same place where we would cry together while the chains creaked under our bodies weight as we hugged and pulled the swings so close that the rubber rubbed together and we thought it would last forever, this monumental sad, but dad got married, mum got married, you got married and I got carried away, with all the people that i loved and didn’t love but let me say the only love i know will last until after my last breath, is the love for you i have even when i have no love left. 

and the strings of fate 
tied round my aorta
i have to believe 
they will be shorter 
when little bean 
sprouts to a shoot 
and little shoot 
starts growing fruit 
and all the things 
they will become 
we’ll watch them grow 
under the same sun 
that we grew under 
with each other 
and there is no-one 
who quite gets me 
who understands our langoowahgee
nuo matutairwuhat tuhay langoowahgee
wehreh on tuhaysamay pahgee 


through existing you are constantly reminding me that i have worth that i am good the way i am and not just that also the fact i have the ability to make such a lovely person laugh and despite how crap the world can be sometimes you know it’s true that i love the bad times too because they help me get closer to you 

the fact that i have the chance to make such a lovely person laugh 
ist a gift to lift the spirit of the ones you love, be daft 
you are the best mum just like mum that i could ever really think of, sis 
i can’t wait to aid the life you’ve made in his photosynthesis

FOR it was her fate to remain in her grief, in that same spot. She knew if she had left to go ‘home’ so to speak, she would never have returned. But the years within the walls had weakened her spirit by adjusting her minds’ eye to the grief; reaching a state of numb unawareness, paralysed and unmoving.

AI takes over station One, and tells everyone what’s happening while they’re underground. Maybe SWA break in and They just drop down dead (net) 
Net sees it’s hopeless to depend on the NIA, must depend on the people instead 
But Net still wants to cull 98% of numans, so she has to come up with a way to kill the final 5%

Appointment.”
Aki’s pulse quickened, and Patroc felt it through his hand. They shared a loving glance and grinned. 
Annette stood behind her desk with their file, still yet to sit down and regarded them with the utmost love and respect. 
It overwhelmed her to see this couple take the step that she was so ready to. She took her seat in her chair, attempting to cover her emotion by covering face with her hand - but even if she wasnt crying, Aki, the empath, would be able to tell in an instant. 
He stood up and walked around the gulf that was the desk, to her chair, where he outstretched his arms to embrace her. She accepted, mumbling into the fabric draped over his shoulder:
“I’m sorry. I’ve been off work for a while, this is still tough for me.” 
Aki places his hand on her head and threw a concerned look at Patroc, who was so inept at picking up on subliminal cues, yet perfectly versed in the nonverbal language of Aki, walked over to them and joined in the hug. 
“This isn’t how it should be, you’re the patients, I should be comforting you!”
Aki said “all  know you’ve experienced great loss, Dr. Stringer 









Hallucinations that show the real world !!!!

Opening image is Sofias dream. The radio is playing in the background over her like a boring soundtrack. The pinhole is opening in annette’s office when the whale jumps over her. ocean, waves, sound waves discussion, mention the radio about to wake her up, the fact that she’s unaware of the connections she shares with the other people listening, just like the moon, tetraskelia, and the planetary orbits and their colonies talk about how we incorporate the real world into our dreams 
Spin discussion = cycles 
How to encorporate trees...? The seasons, leaves falling 
Blowhole of whale makes reference to the pinhole opening 

Energy needed to open the pinhole comes from listeners to the podcast hearingapril’d phrase and this creating feedback in her head, and theirs, until the leaves fall to the ground and this mass transfer of spiritual energy is captured in the net under the hivetree and Chanelled through the bismuth wires Apollo told them to design, into the frame where the pinhole is generated. Closing image mirror is the cycle of leaves falling and spirits climbing the strings of the tree again (enlightenment, rebirth, death), the cyclotron accelerating the virus, the pinhole opening itself makes spiral waves of energy emanate from the wires around the frame to the centre, leaving a circle of infinitely small size in the centre, through which to send the virus. The radio transmission from the start is playing telling the listener they’ve  come full circle 

Chapter titles stages of cellular division and then final act is fusion and into viral life cycle stages?


Cyclical preamble: The cell cycle is controlled by keys and locks of enzymes and substrates called kinases and cyclins. Every round of cellular division requires re-synthesis of the entire cellular contents.

HOOKS 
THE UNEXPECTED
CAUSE & EFFECT
HOW DID IT FEEL?
CONCRETE DETAIL 

NONE OF IT MATTERS WITHOUT AUTHENTICITY
Authenticity means saying ‘i trust you to see who i really am’

Never trust anyone who keeps their chocolate in the fridge, and especially if they keep their oranges out of it 

Sofia has an autoimmune condition? 
That is going to kill her, before she died she becomes rooted in the tree with NORA 
Neurologically Operated Reservoir Algorithm 

They needed a physical body to act as a conduit between the physical and spiritual realm in the strings of mycorrhiza 
Sofia’s body becomes filled with mycorrhiza until the entangled particles meet and annihilate, emitting waves of energy that provide the energy for synthesis of the subatomic virus (?)

The act of merging plant and animal through fungus = unity = last stage of physical life, allows communication between physical and spiritual realm 

The listeners start to hear all about the earth we used to have through Sofia, 
The trees are telling her about the animals that used to play in them, the dead humans are telling her about the fish that used to be in what used to be the sea 
They are telling her that because there are no trees on the other planets, these spirits are trapped, disconnected, unable to move on from their decaying and incinerated bodies. Other planets lord themselves over earth because only the most genetically superior Numans were the Founders of the Outer colonies, with smaller groups being taken from the previous planet each generation; so the genetic diversity of the outermost (decaskelia) is drastically reduced meaning lifespan is much longer, but their ability to survive the virus is also reduced and almost nobody survives. Cliffhanger could be about spirits trapped in outer colonies and the team on earth wanting to save them; the seemingly insurmountable problem


Sofia is the one sending manifestations to Aires (“hallucinations” of Nora and Annette outside the bubble) Sofia herself (Annette’s face on computer screen, voice in the white noise of the radio) 
Schizophrenic patient instructs team how to tap the energy emitted from MycoSofia to open the pinhole 

All the spirits of humanity become one, but in a cluster that cycles through the dimensions of the tree in subatomic strings. Those in the mycorrhiza are recently departed, and the further up the trunk you go, the further back in time the spirits stored you find there are. Enlightenment is reaching the leaves and falling from the branch, to be absorbed by the earth and begin the cycle again. At the end of the book, humanity from 21st century is in the leaves of the tree that mycosofia is under. After the opening of the pinhole, the leaves of all the trees fall to the ground in the final image.

Could the narration be a series of radio transmissions and reports? This could end up being contrived and info dumpy

World building from news announcements 
SW civil war about immigration and trade with SE point (SW believes SE are inherently lazy, weak, cast them out because of their belief in the spiritual)


mo explains the positioning of the medipod in the opening conversation - centrally located for convenience and accessibility, but also because good health relies on an amalgamation of healthy body, mind, and spirit. Annette has spent her whole life in mind, and it has made her body and spirit weak. Mo encourages her to get back into yoga, which is the perfect combination of the two. He gives her two options, either the gym in SW or the temple in SE. Then the timeline could split into these two realities. 
She actually goes to the temple in SE, but first the story explains what happened in a parallel universe where she chose the gym. It is from this parallel universe that we get exposition of how bad things really are in SW, and the whole Of Triskelia 

Eventually Nora uses intense yoga moves to move her consciousness to the spiritual realm before her second brain becomes too big for her skull. Patrick performs the autopsy and sees no evidence of either brain, the skull is empty (the second brain has engulfed and transported the first brain) the second brain should be named neuromerkava for “brain transport vessel” 


Guitalele melody
on this side 
of triskelia 
we reside 
no fear 
of the southWest
who call us weak 
as they detest 
the prose we speak
this tapped land 
will stand no leak
force their hand
while we turn our cheek
We South East 
With spirit’s guide 
will still see peace 
in our third eye 
The North has more 
eyes than three 
knows what’s in store 
for you and me
Their minds may sieze
crave power, control 
But we South east
still have our Soul.
