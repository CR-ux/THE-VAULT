<span style="color:#000ff;">look at what you've done to me</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">in my sleep</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Morpheus came and made friends with me</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">He brought all the Ancient Greeks</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">I am a dove by name</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">But names are deceitful</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">You took me home and I cried and I cried and I never was peaceful</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">Don't worry mum I know you did your best</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">To extract the worry worry worries</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">Out of my chest</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">I carried on crying til I left</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">And now i'm crying again</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">I'm still the same little boy curled up in bed</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">I've just got longer hair</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">And a wrinkle or two here and there</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">And dozens of reasons to care</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">In my room there is a mess</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">In my room there is the biggest fucking mess and nothing less</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Sometimes in my room there's another mess</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">But it's mostly just one mess</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">One mess</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">One mess</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">One mess in the mess</span>




<span style="color:#000ff;">I've lost a lot of sleep</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Counting too many sheep</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Wearing graduation caps</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Spent a long time twisting</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">And cramping and complaining</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Trying to stay intact</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">I've been in the sky mostly</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">And you've been there with me</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">But you were in a plane going east</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">And I can't help but feel that the feelings I'm feeling are feelings of Someone released</span> 


<span style="color:#000ff;">Because Nothing really matters</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">When you really think about it</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">How liberating</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Is that</span> 



<span style="color:#000ff;">he left a voicemail and it said</span> 





<span style="color:#000ff;">F is For…</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">I lost something I really liked today</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Just like everything it starts with A</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">Is for Accidental baby is for Bach's first cello suite</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">C stands for me and what a Cunt I can be</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">D is for Death is a part of E is for Everything</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">F is for Fish</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">And Fingers and Feet</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">F is for Freedom</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">And Friends and “Fuck me,</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">These Fair ground rides just make you sick</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">F is for nights spent Fighting awake</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Cus Fear of Failure made its way</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">In Front of the traffic of what we all have to say</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">Forgive and</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Fade away</span> 











<span style="color:#000ff;">scrolling through contacts on my phone</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">my head was spinning and my chair was spinning</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">the 1st of day of the year and i was alone</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">and i thought will the end be like the beginning</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">i was reminded of that scene from amelie</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">where the man cries after returning from the funeral of his best friend</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">and he erases his name from his address book</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">while i touched the universe of. names</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">and read aloud the numbers</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">and held my finger over the blood red delete button</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">of all the ones who had gone last year, and all the things that they took</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">later on in harry's room he put on some abba</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">and we laughed at the song as they told us to have a</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">vision now and then of a world where every neighbour is a friend</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">and i said jesus christ did you ever realise how depressing the lyrics to this song are and he said but it sounds so happy</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">new year</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">i hope this one's a good one</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">somethings's coming i can feel it near</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">you can count on life to give you things</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">but they w</span>
