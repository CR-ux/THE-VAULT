Chicken egg dog 
Cluck hatch crack bark 
Sleepy small frog
moon shaped birth mark 

In the moonlight 
Of your forearm 
I turn in and 
turn off alarms 
(turn off the light) 


Please don’t die I 
Need you living 
I knew that life was 
Unforgiving 
From before our 
First beginning 
I just thought that after 
All the loss 
We could be winning 
God I just love you so much 


I dreamed you suggested 
we get married on the way back from 
Your wedding 
And  then suddenly there was an ancient goddess 
Telling us the truth 
Whose silhouette was traced 
In the patterns of the world map 

Someone asked me if I wanted 
To learn how to shock your urethra 
With electricity 
You were strapped to a four poster bed 
And I thought… sure? 

There was an ocean of darkness 
Filled with dirt and  snakes 
And we were wading in it 
Treading on slimy moss 
And sharp shells and crustaceans 

And then my friend was stuck in a box 
We had to find our way out of 
A labyrinth 
And I heard her scream 
Callie I’m going to die 
Before her bones were crushed by the ceiling 
Lowering and flattening 
Darkening 

And then we could fly 
and we had to 
We had to fly away to somewhere 
Where we could help 
I had to turn around and say goodbye 
I held onto your arm 
And we flew so high 
There were others in the sky 
Against us
