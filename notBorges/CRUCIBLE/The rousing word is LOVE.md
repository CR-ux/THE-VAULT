A magickal text for the modern era 
Scripture for Truth 

Create trance state 
Write unencumbered 
Perhaps speak 

Edit later 


This is your destiny 
This text will shift the consciousness of the planet 
Writing this text will speak your greatest truth into existence 


Possible chapter structure (should either be THREE, FIVE or SEVEN)
ON LOVE - the In breath
ON FEAR - the Out breath
(ON DESIRE - Fear, dressed as Love 
ON DEATH - Love, dressed as Fear
ON POWER - The Love of Fear/what we think we should love
ON PAIN - The Fear of Love/what we think we should fear)
ON GOD - The Fearless Love 

Read the Bible, Quran, baghavad Gita for reference
Use parables in a similar way? Or stories of my own 
How to make it magical 
Transformative 
Spells 
Incantations 
Shifting consciousness as you read 
Symbols and abstraction (but not too much) 



If all of this is a sentence 
If all of this is a song 
If all of this is a cell
If all of this is a game 
If all of this is a simulation
If all of this is a dream  




All leading to the ultimate realisation 
We are each of us God 

The part of you that thinks you are god is not 
The part of you that knows without thinking is.
