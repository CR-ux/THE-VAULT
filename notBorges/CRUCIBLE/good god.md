they said you've got me
good god
looking down on me

i don't want to confide in someone who misunderstands
if i lie in your arms i don't want to stain your hands

so i'll find god in my own way
in the beautiful things that people say
i won't subscribe
or deny 
the fact i'm different to other guys 


i could die
a thousand times
just to see you smile
but why 
should i 
why should i




good god
if you're looking down on me
please stop
you won't like what you see
