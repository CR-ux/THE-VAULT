I am not brave for being. 

I am brave, yes, 

But not for your reasons 

I am brave for My Own 

And my bravery is further reaching 

Deeper sinking 

Wider soaring 

Than you will ever know 

I am not brave for being 

I am brave for telling you 

To stop calling me brave 

I am brave for my sisters 

I am brave for my siblings 

I am brave for the children I will never bring into this world 

I am not brave for being. 

I am brave for refusing to translate my experience so it might be understood 

I am not brave for being. 

I am brave because I know what true bravery is -


The realest bravery 

Is to be scared, to be scared all the time 

I am not brave for being.

To be paralysed by fear 

And still to smile 

When someone, upon seeing me exist 

Upon seeing me, being -

Decides to call me

“Brave”.
