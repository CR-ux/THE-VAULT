	DRINK FROM THE RIVER, FORGET 
	DRINK FROM THE RIVER, FORGET 
	THERE IS NO POINT IN REGRET 
	SO DRINK 

	[aenid excerpt]

	Drink from the river forget what’s been done 
	Cradling currency on your wet tongue 
	Drink from the river forget how to sing 
	Under the elm overwhelmed by what clings

	[reversed & forward ] NO, NO, NO, NO…
	No Lethe, Cocytus (Koh-kite-us), or Acheron, Neither Phlegethon’s fiery pain, Or noble River of Styx, 
	Is able to wash out the stain In things that breathe here in the world; 
	For only virtue’s water can Wash out the stain in life unfurled
	No breezes that come bringing rain, 
	No balm of yellow sandalwood, No necklaces beside, or gems Or soft effulgence of moonbeams, 
	Can here avail to calm and soothe 
	ALL OF Men’s fevers in this world; whereas 
	This noble, this supremely flowing cool, 
	Well-guarded virtue quells the flame.

	Amaj, Bb mai, Eb man, C min (LH)
	Gmin 3rd/Fmin 3rd alternating (RH)
	Where is there to be found the scent 
	That can with virtue’s scent compare, 
	And that is borne against the wind 
	As easily as with it? Where 
	Can such another stair be found That climbs, as virtue does, to heaven? 


	Verily I build such frail houses 
	Verily I build them by the stream 
	Verily I build on such foundations 
	To rot away the leaves of my false dreams

	heavenly dreams wilt and crumble in the breeze 
	Falling down to drown in rivers out to sea 
	No longer buoyed for never was I emptied 
	Of all the men who’ve ever been inside of me
