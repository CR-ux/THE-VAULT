Genome engineering for IAV resistance in pigs 
Hamish

H1N1/2 H3N2 endemic in pigs globally 
Diagram of spread- what was the picture in 2013/15? 

Flu rep in nucleus 

ANP32 family 
Globular leucine rich 
PIR + tumor suppressor domain + chromatin remodeling/transcription regulation (soluble tail, interferes with histone acetylation) 

KO ANP32A abolishes viral replication and transmission in chickens 

KO ANP32A AND B abolished in mammals 


ANP32 evolution 

A groups together for Pigs, chickens, humans 

A/B support mammalian adapted viral pol activity in pig cells 

SP AAs of porcine ANP32A/B to remove viral pol functionality without being lethal to animal 

Editing strategy 
CRISPR -+ NHEJ 
Gene disruption causing frameshift & early stop codon 

Homology directed repair 
Prevent interaction with PB2 by AA sub 

ICE analysis shows efficiency of guide cutting in CRISPR

Avian flu canâ€™t use ANp32B for replication 

33aa region essential for polymerase activity in chickens
