touched my feet
they were warm
but i felt no heat
and i want to scream
even if i did you wouldn't hear me


i'll be myself
keep getting help
won't try to die 
stay under a sky
with a higher propensity to cry 
than i 

it's hard to believe 
i'm still rolling down my sleeves
trying to be 
what they want me to be

you'll change if you want to
but i don't want to

i don't need you

i work in laboured metaphors
and i thought we were a caterpillar 
i work in deluded hope when i let enough light in
now the mothballs are falling 
i could ask myself what i'm doing, and how
well i could feel a lot sadder than i am right now
yeah i could feel a lot sadder than i am right now

brand new misery old friend slumber old friend swallow old friend soft and sweet and painful kiss on the cheek
i ask for the things that make me weak
i beg for what won't make me complete
because where's the fun in knowing where to sleep
and where's the one you said you'd keep 
where's the coldness of your feet on someone else's feet
i feel a warmth but i feel no heat

am i a genius or am i just a fucked up little mess
that you can scrape off your shoe and show to your friends and laugh about how you stared at my split ends for hours on end for hours on end


i don't conform to myself
cause when i do i need help

 

moon princess you looking' 
so fine tonight
i'm alright
i've been sleeping all day
just to bathe in 
your light
you my girl
you my world
if i could i'd live on you
for the rest of my life
moon princess
it's just you, my best
and me, my worst 
getting undressed
you're watching
waiting
you're patient
and when the day is done
you'll always 
come back again 

hey
what you up to 
my friend
what you up to
click send
hey i'm just washing my hair
what about you
do you even care
do you even care

i dont wan a look at this lcd screen
no more
i just wan a sit alone with you on your
bedroom floor

i'm just writing a song
right down your street
i'm just writing a song
click delete
i'm getting lonely
click delete
i wish you were here with me
click delete
i just want to kiss your face
click delete
just please come round to my place
click delete






my life is spent walking downstairs, making coffee with two sugars and no milk, smoking, walking back upstairs to lie in bed on my computer, just to go back downstairs again. I'm scared I'm going to go back there again. I'm scared that soon I'll be swallowed into the blackness of my bed sheet, the blackness of my coffee. I'm scared to go outside in case the demons in my head show themselves to the rest of the world. I'm so fucking scared of everything 
When I was 4 I cried at the sight of a worm split in two. I don't know why. I think it was my first experience of death. Now look at me. I'm splitting in two myself. My halves are being held together by a bundle of tendons.
