RESPECT YOURSELF 

Remember when you would take me seriously? 


ARE YOU PUNISHING ME FOR WHAT YOU DID?

IN MY SMALLEST MOMENTS I AM BIGGER THAN THIS 

FAGOCYTE

I ATE EVERYTHING PLEASE LET ME GO 

MY PLATE IS EMPTY PLEASE LET ME GO 

VOMIT POOLS AT THE BACK OF MY SKULL 

BROKEN OPEN 

PLEASE GOD DON’T TAKE MY EYES I AM STARTING TO SEE WHAT I LOOK LIKE

OPENING OF ALBUM:
HE/HYMN

HEE-HEE-HEE-HEE-HEE-HEE-HEE-HEE
High Acapella notes layered together into rhythm
Clattering cymbals and drums come in, shattering glass 

Crescendo to very quiet drone and simple melody/lyric 
My lord is my master 
My lord is my slave 
My lord is my pastor 
My lord is depraved 
My lord is my saviour 
My lord is my loss 
My lord is my hatred 
And the love it costs

He protects me always 
Bound within these chains 
He devours my airways 
And exhales mortal pains

He fucks me oh so gently 
While I’m laid to rest 
Punishes my body 
When I fail his test

ALBUM MEANT TO BE PUT ON SHUFFLE AND USED FOR DIVINATION (?)
Each track corresponding to a tarot card or something akin to this 
Use ancient symbols to create own condensed tarot OR major arcana only
- 22 tracks

INTENSE CLARINET LAYERS BECOME ABSOLUTELY OVERWHELMING INTO NOISE 

SWALLOW A MICROPHONE

Each track a spell 
Hypnotising the listener 
Meta somehow 
Interacting directly with listener 
Making the new age demonic (guided meditations summoning demons?)
Danger music for the listener 
Unhinged
Dissolved structures 
Ghedelia inspired 
Tape loops 
Western esotericism 
Occult 
Satanism 
Kabbalah 
Demonology
