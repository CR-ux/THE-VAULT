Inferior book



the woman who made me 
and i went for coffee 
i had just left the flat 
White and oak milk chai 
She looked so deeply through me
She looked so deeply at the inside of me 

you are my sister and i love you



it was the phone 
it’s always the phone 
and that christmas eve
The four of us sat there alone 
I went to sleep listening to the truth that you told her 
that i held with its stick resting against my shoulder 
the shade of the self that I needed to learn 
The shade of the self that we all need to learn 

I went back to bed, my darling 
For there was nothing in the world that I could count on 
Even that I would wake up was an assumption 
But I woke up, I woke up where I belonged 

amer action

 

i couldn’t look at my face 

and on an unknown beach 
i heard him running towards my back 
and i couldn’t look back 
and he jumped on top of me and we fell to the ground 
our mouths making trapped animal sounds 

on that unknown beach 
with the tide coming in
i could no longer reach 
his arctic heart within 

my hands were occupied 
holding my umbrella 
holding onto what i couldn’t tell her
upholding the farcical facade of gender 
the renderer remembers 

the women who made me 
were whispering in my ears 
fiona, regina, joanna
amanda 

she’d been putting her arms around me for years 
holding an umbrella not resistant to tears 

and all at once they came to me 
all the memories on my skin 
the proof of who we were 
the end of us where I’d begin 

his eyes darted about like fireflies 
i was fucking terrified 
he really might have nearly died 
the night invited death inside 

and then his seizure stopped 
and we both woke the fuck up 
the start of me the end of us 
the start of him the end of us 

i felt the punch 
of not being hit 
i felt the punch of a conduit 
i felt the punch 
of being alone 
he read the punch 
on her phone 
i felt the punch 
of not being punched anymore 
stockholm love 
on an unknown shore 
ai felt the punch and i hit the floor 
i’ve skipped lunch to many times before 
i thought i knew the score 


i was screaming into the abyss and somehow you heard me 
the abyss screamed back and i felt undeserving 
o

Why is nothing enough 
And everything is too much 

if i could just hear you 
then i could be near you 
and together we’d huddle sheltered from the rain 
And with one hand you cradled my shoulder 
a map of Edinburgh in the other 
I thought the rain had got through, another year 
You pointed at the map and said 
You
Are
Here
