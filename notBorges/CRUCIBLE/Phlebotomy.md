Phlebotomy 
0141 355 1525


On the crisp six AM of a sad Sunday morning 
I pulled a still gristle-dripping, newborn womb-shed human 
From the knots of the trunk of an old oak tree
(these things, they tend to happen
 in spite of the light of me)

Unconscious 
I wander into forests 
Stepping into lakes and puddles 
Biomes of no-home solitude 
I afford the hopeless falling 
into wretched holes of my own digging 
(these things, they just keep happening
no matter what is shed or kept in store for me) 
Quell the noise of your chewing jaw 
I’ve never cared who joins me 
(I thought: I just wanted to walk) 

Everything I thought 
I was 
unsheathing from the bone 
The scolding heat of what 
I really am, 
have always been 
Is waiting for a chance to speak 
If I can shut the fuck up 
long enough 
To hear 
(these things, still happening
Relentlessly) 
A fleck of salt, a fire, a flood 
A tweezer pull and beads of wood 
Wrestling in a knot, impossible 
Rotting, flaking, choke 
On bark 
Eyes peeling
For the oak tree 
For the wardrobe 

For a sigh of beauty sleep 
To leave this ugly world 
(these things
they just aren’t happening 
you silly little girl)
