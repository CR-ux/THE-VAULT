# End of Abundance Thinking

Climate change is defined as a global shift in atmospheric temperature, due to both natural and man-made processes. 

The past eight years are on track to be the eight warmest on record, fuelled by ever-rising greenhouse gas concentrations and accumulated heat. Extreme heatwaves, drought and devastating flooding have affected millions and cost billions this year, according to the World Meteorological Organization’s <a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/our-mandate/climate/wmo-statement-state-of-global-climate" rel="noopener" class="external-link" target="_blank"><u>provisional State of the Global Climate in 2022 report</u></a>.
2022 took an exceptionally heavy toll on glaciers in the European Alps, with initial indications of record-shattering melt. The Greenland ice sheet lost mass for the 26<sup>th</sup> consecutive year and it rained (rather than snowed) there for the first time in September.
The global mean temperature in 2022 is currently estimated to be about 1.15 [1.02 to 1.28] °C above the 1850-1900 pre-industrial average

Data extrapolated from our current carbon consumption has elucidated the dwindling numbers remaining on the Doomsday clock, 
and a rapid shift in our principles has been required for quite some time if our species or global economy are to survive. 

The abundance of our thinking and the abundance of biodiversity on the planet are negatively correlated.
