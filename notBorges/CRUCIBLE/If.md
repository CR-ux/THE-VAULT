You were here 
To undo my dress 
Or zip me up 
I guess 
I wouldn’t 
have written this mess 
To begin with 

And im stupid
For even 
Thinking about i

people
like ingredients of food 
you’ll consume throughout your life 
perhaps mere seeds now
tracing their own convoluted paths
to you
before being merged together 
taken in 
to nourish you in a transient moment
before they’re gone
swallowed and
transformed
the cycle starting over
