IN SPITE OF GOD’S APPARENT ADJOURNING
 I LOOM A WOMB FROM DIRT SNAGGED OUT OF ME 
AND WITHIN THIS SINGLE TORN RED THREAD A SIGNAL YEARNING 
THE TAPESTRY APPEARS UNRAVELLING THE YEARS IN HARMONY 

I LEFT MY LITTLE BABY 
IN THE BUILDING 
THAT I BURNED 
I HAD TO KILL MY BABY 
TO LEAVE NO STONE UNTURNED
MY BLISTERED LITTLE BABY 

Can’t be kissed better now 
I CAN’T KISS IT BETTER NOW 
THAT I AM THE LITTLE BONNIE CHILD 
I LEFT 
AND ALL THE FLAMES APPEARED TO FOLLOW 
ALWAYS GROWING GLARING STAIR TO 
KNOWING WHERE TO
FIND ME 



I left my little baby in the building as it burned 
Of The unearthly things I’d done the wee one couldn’t ever learn
