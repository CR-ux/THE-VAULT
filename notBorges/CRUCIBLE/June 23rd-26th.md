Ask Janine for Nisan space in Sierra Metro and spaces in Glasgow 


KATABASIS was funded by  Help Musicians UK's Do It Differently Fund, the tour is currently being organised with Edinburgh's Summerhall confirming two back-to-back dates, KATABASIS is closing the StagEHd festival in Princes St Gardens 29th May, the Skinny have interviewed via email which should be published at some point this year. 


I am a classically trained multi-instrumentalist with over two decades of experience and a seasoned performer, having played countless DIY shows in the Midlands (where I'm originally from), a few shows in Glasgow, and many more serious shows in Edinburgh. The KATABASIS. I have developed an extended technique for the tour that uses a 2m long metal chain being whipped against the strings of an electric double bass, the signal being heavily processed through Ableton before it is fed into the PA

I find myself at a pivotal point in my career, receiving multiple grants for my work and being a founding member of an award winning charity based around creative expression, Spit It Out. I have forged a small, tight-knit and dedicated Patreon community who support my work monthly and allow me to continue to create new material for them, and I have reached a point in my practice where experimentation in the live setting only enriches the performance, rather than risking its technical proficiency. I feel I have truly found my artistic voice with the release of KATABASIS, occupying a dark, neoclassical, abrasive space, which juxtaposes the harsh and the soft, crystallising what it has meant for me to find my own femininity from within the insurmountable harshness of my birth assigned gender and the transphobia I have been subjected to throughout my life.
