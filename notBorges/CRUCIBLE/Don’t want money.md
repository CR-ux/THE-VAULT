Don’t want money 
Don’t want love 
Don’t want food 
Don’t want time 
I just want all my friends to be alive 


Don’t want to speak 
Don’t want to write 
Don’t want to sleep 
In this endless night 
Don’t want to hear 
Don’t want my sight 
Just want all my friends to be alright 

Don’t want to go anywhere 
Never learned how to drive 
I just want all my friends to be alive 

Just keep thinking back 
To when all my friends were alive 




Words are so meaningless now 
But they mattered to you 
Life feels so meaningless now
