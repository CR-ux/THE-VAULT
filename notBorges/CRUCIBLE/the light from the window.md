sitting down to pee 
the light from the window 
kissing the back of my head 
Kissing the same spot 
You kissed[^l] 

better -

Opening a door 
The bathroom door, the frontmost door, 
Oh God, the opened sky - 
I’m not afraid of You anymore

Hold 
the door
This place 
The freshest threshold
To move
effortlessly through
into soothing coolness 
of recombinant Air

To breathe - 

When you look at me.

Sitting down at my piano
A foreign sense of company 
In the deepest recess of my chest 
Saxophones are sighing
And no cards could have divined 
This latest sweetness 
To the crystals of my crying 

For I was built from pillars of salt 
Sifting, shifting the truth of my weight 
My body’s Lot 
as Lot’s forgotten wife 
The purest garden overgrown
Asleep in the centre 
An unmade bed of nettles  
sleeping all my life 

sleeping all my life away -

Yet sitting down to eat 
On a meadows bench 
The cold biting around my fingernails
(A job retired a while ago) 
Thinking of the fullest Nothing 

A Being 
filled with
The light from the window 
Waking up from mourning
to kiss the notch of your shoulder 
Showing my weary head 
The place 
where it’s okay
to rest
