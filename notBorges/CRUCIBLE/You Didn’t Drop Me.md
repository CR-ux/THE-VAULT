*You Didn’t Drop Me* 

Inside your dressing gown 
I count the hairs on your arm
Far fewer than mine 
(A smoothness I could never know)
And I’ve never had this much room before 

Ungroomed, unkempt, dishevelled 
You trimmed my claws in your bed 
I know no love is like another 
(And I will never be my brother)

I know your smell so well by now 
It keeps me up at night 
When I am down and out
And you move about me, lovingly
Make allowances for all my messes 
Dampening noises I try not to make 

And falling, 
It was easy - 
All I ever had to do 
was struggle 
You didn’t 
Drop me 
(I know how that should feel by now)

And out, away, from the safety of your hand 
It was only my own gravity
Holding on to me then 

And it could have never been your fault 
I’ve never had this much room before 
(I promise you, this isn’t blood)

I told myself I needed more -

In the rattled cage of morning 
(Knowing not what I had asked for)
I fell, now pulleyed by the sun 
Reaching with my growing claws
At the lesser, empty freedom 
I’d known so many times before
The nails and grain in wooden boards
Of the sprawling wide and open floor 


Told myself I needed more 
Knowing not what I asked for 
Reaching with my growing claws 
Lesser freedom of before 
Nails and grain in wooden boards
Sprawling wide and open floor
