ADHD and autism together feel like they are at war in my head 
I am more able to mask in person because of the inherent anxiety of being around another human being and the social rules I have learned to follow in that situation
Texting allows a form of social abstraction and the person on the other end of the text becomes a recipient of information 
ADHD destroys my impulse control while the autism makes my distress tolerance very low 
When I become overwhelmed I enter a cycle of texting inappropriately panicked thoughts in a stream of consciousness, upon not receiving a reply from a NT loved one immediately I send more uncensored texts, worsening the problem 
I should start typing things into notes app or perhaps call people instead to receive live feedback as to how appropriate what Iâ€™m saying is through tone of voice (but I always tend to interpret even neutral tone and facial expression as negative)
Group chats are the worst because there are just so many people at once that the variables are too great and I lose all sense of what is appropriate for whom, often unravelling in a digitally public sense and causing an even greater shame spiral
