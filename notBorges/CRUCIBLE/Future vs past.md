Future vs past 

Do you get more deprabout the past or anxious about the future? 

How strange it is that we can sense an ocean of feelings from a single set of frequencies 

How stranger that a single wave may not provide enough context for its mood 

Only multiple notes together make a magical Other note, invisible, inaudible, only feelable 

Entirely pervading all
