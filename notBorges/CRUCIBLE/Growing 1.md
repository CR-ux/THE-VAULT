# This
Twisted 
And deciduous body 
Indebted 
These ever grieving limbs
 just reaching 
Every
Body 
Leaves 
Reaching 
Every
Body it must 
just 
Be destined for the dust

Of Reaching 
Of
Branches


the inevitable motif is an  ancient echo, distant burning structures of safety, its resonance will far outlive your candle’s flicker

the searing strings sweep the floor crawled upon, unavoidable puppetry, marionette pyre, too distant to be met with, white hot, noxious, far, far too close, obsidian skin basted in the lasting night’s sweat 

the drum 
in its vast goodbyeing 
and its long so longing 
has long before now been beaten, 
beaten, beat and burned 
in the  heartskipping rhythm  
of ailing throb of the neck 
In pain
Wreckage of irreconcilable distance 

the raw throat, cooked, bubbling, simmering
Blistered and shimmered It scratches and flattens the pattern of mattering in stitch picked sickly and distantly severed discordant excuse for a melody 

while crescendoed rope-throes of memory swells towards felling trees bereft of their owls and begging to howl in the bowels of the flame 

No 

No name , there is none 

Only facing up to the face 

Of the God who forgot 
to lay the stippled bricks of ill-fated 
still awaited, slipping from the fist 
dripping drop drop drop drop drop of rain 
to the sunken plans of a drunken man and your humble bunk 
your chunk of mess, 
your apartheid state of desiccated plains 


the trumpet is remaindered in its cracked open valves 

Melts into watching - 

piano keys locked on inferno of vice of desire neglected and unfulfilled 

for the home coming overture of  falling
 to ashes


the upfront and muting sound of what fetid ember of hope was left and bereft in the leaves of the leaving 
The eaves  so poorly designed 
The siphoning flight of what might be salvageable 
behind 

Chiselled jutting edges longing for roundness of shape 


The House In The Distance  -

Ablaze -

The House 

Past returning 

Blinding 
Licking
Fading
Fleeting
Shrinking
Light 

Going
