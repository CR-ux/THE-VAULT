**I want to expand the scope of this release cycle by bringing the work into the live setting, and increase the reach of my work across Scotland. As much as music has taken on a much more digital modality since the emergence of streaming platforms, further perpetuated by the incidence of the pandemic, live performance still remains the most crucial aspect of marketing for musicians, and as such the progress of my practice has been impeded over the last couple of years. Despite this, I feel proud of the work I have done in laying foundations for this tour, with the assistance of the grant funding from Help Musicians. Being able to record in the studio for the first time has meant that I have been able to create my proudest work to date, and in order to do this project justice (i.e. reach larger audiences and sell records/CDs/tapes and merch) I need to play it live. The two sell out KATABASIS shows I have played to date (along with Summerhall's enthusiasm to host two back-to-back dates of the tour) have given me a renewed sense of confidence in this album. The final date of the tour will be a live-streamed show recorded by a professional documentary team (directed by BBC-commissioned filmmaker Lea Luiz de Oliveira), hosted on crowdcast (the subscription fee for which is included in my budget), which has inbuilt Patreon integration, meaning I will be able to place a patron-only paywall on the show, encouraging increased support for my page, providing longevity for my practice in the long run. The exclusive and distinct nature of this final show will be marketed by my merch/FOH team at each of the shows in both Edinburgh and Glasgow, meaning that even attendees of previous shows will be interested in tuning in for the livestream. This provides a perfect statistical gauge for me to evaluate the success of this tour, by observing the uptick in my Patreon pledges.**
