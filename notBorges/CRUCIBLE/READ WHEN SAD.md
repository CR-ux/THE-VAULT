permalink: READ WHEN SAD
---
you gotta be your own best friend and your own best cheerleader
nobody else is more invested in you than you
you sap so much of your potential and life force just by telling yourself you aren't good enough, you become a self fulfilling prophecy
well i'm gonna be a self fulfilling prophecy of success from now on

koko dake no hanashi 

I’d like you to keep private what I’m about to sing to you 
ket’s keep our desires hidden away in our hearts 
it’s really a secret, a secret 
i want to take a shortcut without getting drenched in the rain, without getting blown by the wind
even if it’s harsh, keep smiling
even if they’re mean, be nice
i don’t want to be sad
don’t want to let the tears rain down 
don’t want to be confused
even if it’s insensitive, smile
just talk about fun things!!!!!
theres a face i wit to see 
there’s a voice i want to hear
when i wake up i want to cry out in joy
good morning
let’s get along well again today


random lyric ideas 

thank you mistakes for making me 
life may take and take and break entropy

everything ends why should we be any different 

things wrong with us there are many, many, many 
it’s okay i m so proud of myself right now
\
even if you never praise yourself xternally u should always ALWAYS do so internally
the piece of advice i needed
am i sad to lose you or just the things that come with you ?
am i happy to have you or just the things i can avoid by being with you?
it’s okay
it’s okay
it’s 
O.K.
i am definitely not a boy and that’s why it’s okay that you will leave



jaunty rhythm, anthem-like:
it’s bad but it’s something’
it’s rich but it’s oooooookay
god couldn’t make me happy 
so insteaaad he maaaaade me gay

chorus:
and i

And just cus u a failure with straight privilege bitch 
Don't get mad that a fag do slay ya like West Midlands' WICKED WITCH UH
Duh 
It's genetic my Frenetic energetic poetic technique is aseptic 
eclectic metabolic catastrophic you might want it you don't got it got it 
And what of it? 
a day pray away the day pray away from the 
Day pray away the say what you wanna play in the stage of someone too tall 
A gent who spent all the rent and her life got too small for all you little mans to understand 
She got the talent and she got the time TIME TO WERQ
She got curves made of sharp straight lines BITCH I'm VERS 
She got she got so much fucker 
She's a discombobulating bitch and an existential looker 
B R B A F K A F Ay I Smokin' with ma hookah 
Crawlin n ballin too tall even for babashookahhhh-ha-ha-ha do Rae me far so la te no shado-puhsmokAH

STRATIFY ME 
crucify me 
stratify me baby

—
crying into sleeveless wrist [STRATIFY ME]
bus passengers take breath from her lungs 
what’s inside can only hurt you baby  
IOU in serpent’s tongues

crying into slug trailled wrist 
makes her remember being 1
waking dishes make a fist 
make a fist into a 0

she has never felt the waves 
she has only ever floated 
god never kills and never saves 
god has never even voted                                                       

god is stitching the image of her Self
into a 
well 
a
well
a
well
god is raping the love she has felt 
with a 
well
wither
well

he isn’t moving 
he isn’t moving 
he’s not opposing 
you look so bad in blue
and so it hits you 
and so it hits you 

from a fixed root 
to nothing good 

the bone it clicks true 
he can’t live addressing you 
he got all your letters too
his LIFE IS NOw 
HYPOCRISY APOLOGY
and so it screws into you 
you look so bad in that

safety is not what he’s asking for 
from this place where his gods cannot find him
what spirals now inside his sleep 
is control he shall not keep 

his clothes betray his bones
fall away like skin gone rotten 
i’m not sure if you look like you 
the mirror has long forgotten 

he can’t write a song for you yet 
he has to wait for something terrible to happen 
he can’t write a song for you yet 
he has to wait for something terrible to happen 

she can’t write a song for me yet 
she has to wait for something terrible to happen 
she can’t write a song for me yet 
she has to wait for something terrible to happen 
to you
