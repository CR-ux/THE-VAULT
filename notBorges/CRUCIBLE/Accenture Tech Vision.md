Life Science / Healthcare - Benefits for the trans community

- Improving access to gender services 
- Web3/APIs to integrate data from local services (GPs and GICs)
	- Personally, 4 year wait for medical treatment 
	- Initial ‘consultation’ could be provided by AI chatbot, before beginning wait time to see human clinician. 
	- AR could be used to show the eventual effects of HRT to the patient, providing reassurance and alleviating dysphoria (perhaps bolstered by data sharing thanks to INTIENT)
	- Time to receiving HRT prescription could be drastically reduced, as well as removing the unconscious and conscious human biases that form barriers to treatment, saving many lives.
	- Precision medicine: allows for correct hormone dosages to be data driven and titrated, instead of guesswork 
	- Patient-led: data accessible through API to patient themselves (hormone levels)
