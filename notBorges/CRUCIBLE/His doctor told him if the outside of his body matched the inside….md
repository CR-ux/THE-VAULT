<span style="color:#000ff;">His doctor told him if the outside of his body matched the inside of his mind He'd have no skin and everything would be as raw as bacon rinds that he cut off and left on the side</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">He was eating oranges over the sink</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Cause He didn't know how to think</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">For himself or his health or for anything good for him</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">He just kept thinking if my doctor's analogy turned into reality then oranges would really suck</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">And sucking on oranges nothing rhymes with oranges i'm a bad songwriter fuck"</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">But he shouldn't have been so hard on himself, obsessing about oranges made him unwell</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">You can eat them on a train and you can eat them in the rain and you can eat them with a fox and you can then in a box just never stay in the box for too long or you'll hate yourself and write really sad songs please don't hate yourself</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">For him It all slices diagonally</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">And discomfort is agony</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">He Wishes you could see what He sees</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">All of his inwardly directed fears</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Like that scene from the langoliers</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">But the monster is behind the mirror</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">But that doesn't matter because he's out the door orange juice pours all over his brand new boring suit and he thinks it gives it colour, he thinks it looks much better, he thinks he's onto something plus look it's stormy weather rain is good and rain is cleansing plus the guys got central heating and rain will always leave some time and leave a clear blue sky behind it's not</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Like</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">There's anything wrong</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">It's just</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">That</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">Everything is wrong</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">So he's peeling oranges any place he pleases and writing terrible songs</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Oranges taste so good in stormy weather</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Oranges taste so good in stormy weather</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">He said I swear the stormy weather makes oranges taste better</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Look at my cool elmo sweater</span>
