<span style="color:#000ff;">Three months I sat on your couch</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Kissing you on the mouth</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">And i spoke to you on that fucking mobile app</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">you said who is this and the black mirror cracked</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">i've never been good at that</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">telling people who i am</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">or letting people know what i want</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">i'm screaming that i'm nonchalant</span> 


<span style="color:#000ff;">i bought 10 shares of stock</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">in being an emotional rock</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">i think somewhere i pissed off lady luck</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">she fucked me right after we fucked</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">i'm not a dancer</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">i'm a piano player</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">i move around but not as much</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">i'm not a dancer i'm a piano player</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">the keys are the only ones i touch</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">It's not that I wanted you back I just thought</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">You'd remember the loneliest fish you ever caught</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">But I know now you didn't understand</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">You never even held my hand</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">I'm not a dancer</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">I'm a piano player</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Maybe someday a doctor</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">If I get my shit together</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">And be a bit better</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">At making decisions</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Do I want to make cuts or do I want to</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Make incisions</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">And I had all these questions</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">I still have all these questions</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">You weren't the answer</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Skinny dancer</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">I ate my feelings along with your pasta</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">How fucked up it is</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">That I still think I could have kept you for longer if I'd have gone faster</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">I said you're looking at me</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Do you like what you see</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">And you took all the weight off my aching branches</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">You were cooking fusilli</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">A la make believe</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Oh the difference between looking and indifferent glances</span>
