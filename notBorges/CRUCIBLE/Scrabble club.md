Welcome / introduction: scrabble club for queer people in central (Glasgow & Edinburgh), hoping to find venues for in person get togethers in both cities, but for now focusing on getting together and playing matches online using scrabble go (download link for scrabble Go) and discussing strategy/ plays on this server. 


[rules/ conventions\Word list: list all the British competitive scrabble conventions. CSW21  to be used as standard throughout club matches, mention the different types of ‘challenge’ and reference the Handicap section of the FairPlay policy. ]

 PLAYING GAMES:
Game types:
Ranked (2 players)
Friendly (2+ players)
 All friendlies (2 or more players, individuals or teams) are non-tracked games which provide a great supportive arena in which to try out & discuss new strategies. It is at the players discretion to decide whether friendly matches are played in an open dictionary modality to encourage word study (using apps such as Zyzzyva) and what (if any) turn timing will be imposed. Free challenge is suggested.   Before each 1v1 game, the players decide whether the scores will be tracked (i.e. whether it will be ranked and added to the club’s scoresheet (a React app I have written and embedded which *should* dynamically update everyone’s spread) once this has been decided the game can begin. 


PLAYING PROCESS 

Virtual ranked:
1. Players stay connected (either through this discord or whatever means most comfortable for individual players) throughout match 
- Suggested platforms [write details & give links]:
	- Scrabble Go (app) 
	- ISC 
	- Briefly kindly ask not to use words with friends or apps that don’t use the tournament rules of scrabble
1. If ranked, all rules apply as in IRL games listed below


IRL ranked 
1. Players do secret handshake [faggotry]
2. Game progresses according to ABSP tournament rules [list rules incl. timing w clocks & challenge etc]

Additional:
SCRABBLE IDENTITY - I really want this to eventually be like a gay scrabble power rangers or something?!!?! with the faggotry and flamboyant theatre of wrestling, everyone having their own shtick!! Ideally I want to make a DND / Scrabble hybrid and have special abilities and stats for everyone in a progressing lore that everyone can contribute to, so do let me know if this is something you’d want to incorporate into the club!!

**Scrag**
**Meaning:** The word "scrag" is primarily used as a noun and a verb. As a noun, it historically referred to a thin or bony piece of meat, particularly a neck piece of mutton, lamb, or other animals. In more colloquial usage, "scrag" has been used to describe a person's neck, often in a derogatory sense. As a verb, "scrag" means to seize someone by the neck or collar, sometimes implying to throttle, strangle, or handle roughly.
**Etymology:** The etymology of "scrag" traces back to the late Middle English period. It is thought to come from Old Norse "skragg," meaning a projecting branch or something similar, which aligns with the sense of something thin or sticking out.
**Scraggly**
**Meaning:** "Scraggly" is an adjective used to describe something that is irregular, uneven, or jagged, often in the context of appearance. It can refer to hair, foliage, or a beard that grows thinly and unevenly, presenting a somewhat unkempt or ragged appearance.


Scrag. Late Middle English, from Old Norse "skragg," meaning rough, uneven. 

Gaggle. Middle English "gagyll," describing a group of geese.
