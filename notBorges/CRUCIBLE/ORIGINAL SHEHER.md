ORIGINAL SHE/HER 

Discordance. For as long as I can remember, discordance. A cacophony inside me. 
Even now, I find it hard to articulate in words the enormity of the truth of it. 
A truth so loud and all-encompassing, it seemed everybody around me knew before I did. 
[Noise]
Girl.

The fear of walking home. 
The comfort in a closing door. 
The safety of my sister. 

And I still find myself missing days when nobody would care that we were playing with dolls, or doing makeovers, or choreographing dance routines in the garden together. 
I was young enough then, for it not to matter. 

But then, as if reaching a crescendo, my facial hair started to grow, and my dad wanted very much to teach me how to shave. I avoided this at all costs, much to his dismay. Any time anyone even mentioned my beard I would shudder and recoil, and I didn’t even know why. Looking back now it’s so hard to access any aspect of my girlhood – looking back is an absolute darkness. I couldn’t even begin to allow myself to understand the feelings I had about my gender. The kids at school composed a stinging accompaniment; horns, brass, strings, screeching along to the private sounds of my discordance: 
“FAGGOT”
[Noise]
“FAGGOT” 
[Noise]
“FAGGOT”

 “I’m- [noise]
 Not - [noise]
 Gay -” [noise]


XYZ this wasn’t fuelled by denial, as I would later in my adolescence believe. It was fuelled by truth. If there was any kind of accuracy to these insults, perhaps I could have reclaimed them, taken their power back for myself. But there was a light beginning to amalgamate on the darkest surface of my form. Inside the pulling away, the truth I was pushing towards.

[Noise]
Woman.

There were countless guesses, grasping desperately for answers about why I might be feeling this discordance. This metallic clanging in my soul. I started self-harming at the age of 11 or 12, and back then I couldn’t have told anybody why. I took the caretaker role for the entire family from an exceptionally young age. Acting as a midpoint. A conduit.. I kept my identity and my sexuality a secret from them until I was old enough to leave the house at 18. I felt I had to keep so much of myself hidden. Two selves: one you show to the world, and one you keep just for you. Always just for you. 
[shadow on the ground from spotlight?]

I was taught from a very young age that I was a lesser human. Something to be ridiculed, laughed at, spoken about, taunted, physically and emotionally harmed. And that left me with no map to navigate my own sense of self. I knew there was some gender incongruence, from the youngest possible point choosing exclusively to mix with girls, being consistently ostracised for my femininity, wanting so badly to be able to wear makeup and talk about women’s fashion with my sister. But it was only moving away from Coventry to Edinburgh, to a more accepting place, being able to experiment with my fashion in a safer environment, being around other trans* people and forging healthy queer networks, that I was finally able to say with absolute certainty that I was a trans* woman. It was 2017 that I finally started using she/her pronouns, when I could no longer dampen the sounds inside me, telling me who I was. I had been accepted onto a PhD at the Roslin Institute, another attempt at gaining societal power that could never be given to me; another futile attempt to live the academic, STEM-focused life my father wanted for me. I was in an abusive relationship at the time, and this for a while also held my gender progress back significantly. He buried these toxic self-beliefs, that I was a freak, unlovable, unworthy of anything. He taught me what I couldn’t handle, by showing me what I couldn’t take. What I never deserved.

At this time, I worked at the Genetics Society tent at Green Man Festival in Wales, holding outreach activities and teaching the festival goers about the importance of genetics. I was approached by a couple, covered in sunlight and glitter. I was stunned at the beauty that seemed to permeate from their inner essences and into my tired eyes. We spoke for hours; way longer than I was supposed to, or than I expected. And then we all shared a smile, and they were gone, back into the hustle and bustle of the festival. 

After about a year of being out as a trans* woman to my colleagues at Roslin, and everybody here in Edinburgh, but keeping the truth about my gender a secret from my family back in Coventry, I started to develop physical symptoms of illness, many of them terrifying in their presentation: strange skin eruptions, exploding head syndrome, sleep paralysis, multiple symptoms that seemed to have an autoimmune and/or neurological aetiology, until finally my illness culminated in me passing an alarming amount of blood in my urine. 
To this day, there has still been no medical explanation for this. 
I eventually saw these symptoms for what they were – a calling, a sacred message to be truthful with myself and with those who raised me. In spiritual terms, it was a shedding. In my body’s own way, I was menstruating. 

So, during the first lockdown, when I almost died from the virus and a bacterial pneumonia co-infection, I decided I couldn’t die without my family having known me. I wrote them a long letter that explained everything. At the same time, I knew that I had to give up my father’s vicarious aspirations for me following a career in science, and I left my PhD. 
I faced the very real threat of homelessness. I couldn’t apply for Universal Credit yet, as I was trying to write up a master’s thesis from the 3 years of PhD work I had done; and for this period, around 6 months, with no support from anybody, even many old friends from Coventry cutting contact with me after I’d come out, my circumstance demanded that I do sex work to survive. 
This was one of the most traumatic experiences of my life. It gave me such a harrowing insight into the underbelly of transmisogyny. Example after tangible example of the fetishization and dehumanisation that befalls every. single. trans* woman. For so many of us, because of our simultaneous devaluation and oversexualised caricaturisation in porn (which is often the only media representation we are afforded), sex work is the only option.


I still hold a special place in my heart for the nonbinary aspect of my identity, and I don’t feel the need to eschew it just because I have come into my womanhood. This is why I believe identities are stackable, as gender, the societal construct, is ultimately illusory, but helps us signpost our community, and helps us define our relation to the world as we see it. I have always been an incredibly femme person. I was just not strong enough until 2017 to fully accept it for myself, because I had not been afforded a quiet enough environment in which to hear the noise. In which to disentangle each note, unpick the sonic stitches and find the layers of who I am underneath. Having now had that, I see my nonbinary identity and my time using they/them pronouns as an important steppingstone and an insight into the world’s incessant binarization of gender; but also, as a scaffold – my bird’s eye view of gender was provided by my creative practice and my activism. I have spent my time in Edinburgh working so hard to deconstruct the traits and values that we see as gendered through my art, trying to transcend the concept of gender as a whole, preaching platitudes of gender liberation because I was so sure I’d never be given the opportunity to medically transition, either for reasons of illness or from the infamous gatekeeping of transmedicalism. But over time, this need to be seen outweighed my fear of violence against women: assault, abuse, the ever-present risk of death.
Who would willingly take on this oppression if it wasn’t who they were? Who would willingly accept systemic misogyny, overt transphobia and endless violence, if it wasn’t the ultimate truth at the deepest aspect of their spirit? Certainly not me. I have seen with such horrifying clarity already, in my four years of being entirely femme-presenting, the ignorance, the causal and not-so-casual interruptions in conversations, being ignored by both cis men and women, being spoken over constantly by people of all genders, being medically gaslit. And I have been given this insight into both sides, by virtue of my transness. At the start of my life, afforded this façade of male privilege, a “privilege” I never wanted, or even properly received in its entirety due to my obvious queerness, but a visage of masculine privilege, nonetheless. Walking to the other side, to the ‘Othered’ side, directly experiencing the world’s hatred of women, being treated even less than a cis woman, less than a human, and still knowing in my heart with absolute certainty, that this is me. This is my lot, and always has been. Every misogynistic thought and behaviour perpetrated around me, even before I knew about my own identity, was internalised, further preventing me from seeing my own truth.

I recovered from my illness. I processed the trauma of sex work and picked up the remaining shreds of my self from behind the musty old mattress, finding memories like cotton stuck to the velcro of the bed restraints I had used on these clients, just for a moment restricting their movement, like a farcical role reversal, attempting to remunerate the debt placed on my back, for no good reason, other than the fact I’d dared to approach authenticity. I picked out these strands of cotton. I washed my bedsheets. I knew I had to make something from all of this. 

And I did. I conceptualised KATABASIS: an underworld opera. An allegorical descent to hell, to express what it meant for me to descend fully into my own discordance, find it reflected all around me, and finally, pull myself out of the darkness and bring all of this to light. It was grant funded and I made my way into the recording studio for the first time. The year that followed would be the hardest year of work of my life, reliving the agony of what inspired it, entirely alone, under the cover of darkness. I never wanted it to see the light of day. I never wanted the words I was singing, screaming, to be heard by the Sun. 

I finished the album. It was launched at Summerhall here in Edinburgh during a lunar eclipse. Its first performance left me with a broken rib. The physical damage of my labour. 

Then, after I’d recovered a month later, with the friends around me who had been so instrumental in my own self-discovery, I ventured to Glasgow for a party on New Year’s Eve. Filled with anxiety from the memory of the pandemic, from the prospect of intermingling with other queer people after a year of self-imposed isolation, only working on the dark, traumatic loudness of the album deep underground in a basement studio. I forced myself to go. I forced myself to move towards light. Transmuting the noise, the alchemical prime matter, into melody. Into the beautiful harmony of my friends’ laughter I jumped, all of us held by the sighing hydraulics of the bus as it stumbled its way into Glasgow. We piled into the taxi together, sharing stories of New Years gone by, harder times, easier times, times before we all knew each other, or ourselves. We were going to Sylvia and Barnie’s house - two friends of friends I’d briefly seen on last year’s hogmanay videocall, but the memory of their faces was a blur, underneath all the cacophony of the last year. 

We arrived. They welcomed us. 
Barnie and I gravitated toward one another. I had never felt such immediate connection with someone. We spoke about transness, about nonbinary identity, about sex work. All things they’d also experienced. We spoke about art, about present moment awareness, about music. About discordance. We made love. For the first time in my life, I made love. 

And when we sat down at the kitchen table together, surrounded by friends and partners, surrounded by love and the light of the New Year, creeping in and caressing all of our faces, we started to speak about music festivals. I brought up the brief stint I’d worked for the Genetics Society. We all froze and properly regarded one another across the table. 

Before I knew myself, we had spoke at Green Man Festival. This beautiful couple had approached me and we’d all shared hours of happiness together. And now here we were, after traversing endlessly convoluted pathways apart, causality entangling us, until we had no option but to find each other again. Barnie told me that meeting me was an instrumental step in them beginning to express their own nonbinary identiy.

Barnie and I started dating soon after the party. I have never known such harmonious love. The universe tried to bring us all together years ago, but I had not yet combed through the static of my own experience. I had not yet developed the strength to mold these aberrant frequencies into a steady heartbeat. It was only once I could truly look upon myself and see something worth loving, that this love was allowed back into my life, flooding everything I’d neglected to cultivate. 

After 7 months on HRT, I feel such a sense of control over my life and a will to accept better for myself. This is something I have been tirelessly working on since the pandemic began, focusing full time on my creative practice, which in my work as a noise musician is about harnessing the discordance and using it as art itself. I feel this is a microcosm of my life experience. I have so been dealt much trauma, so much pain, so much violence, and I am grateful for all of it. Because it’s all been directing me, pushing me further and with greater force than I have ever known, towards this.
