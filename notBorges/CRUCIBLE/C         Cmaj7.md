C         Cmaj7
I cried out 
Dm           
anyone who hears 

rise up from your deep sleep 

and the sleeping one awoke and wept 
G
wiping bitter tears, saying:

"who calls me?

where has my hope come from 
C
as I lie in the depths of this prison?"


C
my art is a sickness
Cmaj7
heart a madness

an empty and cracked 
Dm
bowl of a dream 
                G
and the artifice 

of a tight squeeze 

as if somehow someone might be 
                         C
holding in my mesentery 
F Em Dm Em Dm
and keeping all my organs
C
in.

C
I live as a window 
                         Dm
a window into Others' lives 
                               C
teaching them all lessons 
            Dm
them lessons about Light 
                    F
and how it touches 
F Em Dm Em Dm
Every 

Disgusting
C
Thing. 


                 Dm
God, I am hungry - 

and praying - 

to be 
F
remembered 
F Em Dm Em Dm C
(my face contained in silver cloche) 
F Em Dm Em Dm
and I am praying 

not
           C
to be forgot. 


Dm
I live as a widow 
F
Being - 
F Em Dm Em Dm
a fickle 

and so prickly 
C
thing.


Am          G      Em           F (repeat this chord prog)
hingeing on a swinging door 
Am          G      Em           F
a hall of mirrors I abhor 
Am          G      Em           F
and what's more
Am          G      
trust, but diseased 
Em           F
encrusted anxiety 
Am           G              Em
rusted in fallacious apathy 
          F                Am
then whittled by chisels 
        G                Em.
into visages of femininity 
    F.                         Am.  
to capture men as winged statues 
            
quivering on dewy ropes 

I pull from out 

of me 



strings of violins, a cello, and a double bass 

and the web of dirges dance in the mandibles of silence 


F Em F Em F Em Dm 
I devour my love 


F Em
and wonder 
Dm
where
       C
it's gone.





I 

devour 

my

love 





and

wonder

where





it's





gone





"I am the providence of pure Light", I replied -

"I am the thought of the Virgin Spirit 

raising you up to an honoured place! 



Rise up! 



Remember what you have heard! 



Trace back your roots 

to me - 

the merciful one. 



Guard

against the poverty demons 

guard

against the chaos demons 



guard against ALL WHO WOULD BIND YOU!



AWAKEN! 



STAY AWAKE!



RISE



OUT OF THE DEPTHS 

OF THE UNDERWORLD!"
