Hi there, 

My name is Callie Rose Petal, I’m an avant-garde multidisciplinary artist releasing work as ‘lonely carp’, who’s just moved from Edinburgh to this lovely city. 
My album, ‘KATABASIS: an underworld opera’ is an allegorical descent to hell, utilising Greek mythology and symbology of mysticism to crystallise an all-too common experience amongst us trans* women of doing sex work just to survive. 
The album has been pressed on vinyl thanks to my receiving the Do It Differently Fund for its recording and distribution, awarded by Help Musicians UK, and so I’m reaching out to venues to try to book some shows and sell the records.

The KATABASIS sets themselves are driven by performance art accompanying the music, and are incredibly vulnerable and violent. The work has been performed three times at Summerhall, twice at the Wee Red Bar, at Banshee Labyrinth, the Ross Band Stand in Princes Street Gardens and the fringe festival, along with many other smaller venues in and around Edinburgh. The city acted as an important incubator for the early stages of performing the album live, but I know that Glasgow’s music scene is much more welcoming and fitting for the death industrial / noise-influenced nature of my practice (hence why I moved here), and now the performances have developed into something much louder and darker, I am so excited to bring them to the people of Glasgow. 

The album can be heard here:
