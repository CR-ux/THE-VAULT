something growing in my leg 
hurts like hell to touch
another
ultrasound is booked 
opens at the spine a second 
time:
 a something growing in my heart
going
 in
to take another look 

something growing
in my life 
my heart
don't take it too
seriously
don't take it to 
the heart a
lonely distance runner

Something growing in my life 
Feels like not enough 

Something growing in my heart 
Feels like way too much 

I feel it in there
deep within the leg is hurting
acidic building 
basic, blocks from going
something growing
in my leg 
hurting 
helping
rest of me 
growing

To make the nail turn and face away 
(Harder than a promise - More concrete and indelible)


The Holy Lyre Strings ring out 
The body knows to heal itself 
A certain something to hold onto 
The bitter stinging nerve now severed, stirring stitch, dissolved and silent 
rapturing 
Hark- 
Are all my failures singing?
Protectors I have known; To Be:
Projections of my own becoming.
A something spindling to hold onto 
In gentleness and gratitude I wait
Emptiness will clear, make way for window opening, and breathe, and burn and oxygen and
Spark-
And weighted are my fingers 
On kissing all the outside air 
In rest a steeple-needle punctures 
The words He wrote as trailings, drugged and lugged upon my skies
And dredged, and dipped, and drowned in weakness, to hold onto 
Dark-
An hour to honour all their meaning, 
unblackening of both my eyes 
Oo
