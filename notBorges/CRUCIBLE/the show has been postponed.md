# the show has been postponed
# heavy heart is still a heart 
# heavy heart is still 
# heavy heart, still
# holds a beat 

# the show has been postponed 
# the crops cropped 
# burned in a furnace 
# the world is hurting 
# like i used to 

# the show has been postponed
# the world has hurt us 
# like we’ve used it 
# chewing gum, bland
# stripped by saliva 
 
# come march the world might be healing 
# again
# polarity pulls a cloth
# unveils a mirror 
# and collapses itself 
# chiasmic plasma 
# gurgling 
# and every little life 
# gets deeper while
# the living is postponed 
# (again)


# i reprimand the child i was
# who asked for nothing but alone time
# meeting her at the door 
# i hold her spirit 
# nipples on fire 
# clasping at something 
# to burn 
# to ruin 
# dust 
# to dust 
# and life has been postponed
# (again)

# and knowing the circles 
# that circle our hell 
# (entry has a waiting list)
# i have built a structure within it 
# impenetrable quiet 
# where threnodies are sighing 
# creaking reeds in a breeze 
# and breath 
# it gets postponed
# (again)

# and falling, ever falling 
# into broken arms they jutted 
# bone exposed like a branch in winter 
# (the show postponed until the spring)
# and the little boys like i never was 
# piss into a trough standing up 
# their cotton shorts dead at their ankles
# and i soak it all in 

# knuckles pop my knelling toll 
# and charon braids my hair 
# drowning in our oxygen 
# while we wait for tides to take us there 
# to me, to friends and family 
# to a place that’s been postponed
# (again)

# our time is made of matchboxes 
# and strikes of clocks turned back 
# almond slices, cyanide 
# bitterness so beautiful 
# here i am again 
# collapsed into a mirror 
# annihilated harmony 
# where no harm can come to me 
# the world has been postponed
# (again)

# postponed, i am
# able to stand 
# it no longer 
# creeps into my bed with me at night 
# nibbles on my earlobe 
# whispers promises of future 
# when skin can kiss the skin 
# (again)


# all the wrongest things unravel 
# sickly sickle stuck in skin
# sucking trickling sticky substance 
# from within
# every touch puts us in debt 
# caresses are postponed 
# (again)

# what a silly little thing 
# to be turned inside out about
# the deck buckles 
# under wait 
# self immolates
# enlightens my excuse for dinner 
# a broken desk for a dinner table 
# a piano for a date 
# at least a decade late 
# and still, 
# i 
# weight 
# no choice but to postpone
# (again)
