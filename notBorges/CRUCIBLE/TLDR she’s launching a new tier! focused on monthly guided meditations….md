***TLDR****: she’s launching a new tier! focused on monthly guided meditations rooted in Tarot and my personal magickal practice. Each session will blend field recordings, compositions, and a voice recording (“reading”), interpreted through the lens of a single tarot card divined during the lunar ritual, hopefully offering a reflective space for contemplation as I attempt to align my creative and spiritual selves ahead of an upcoming moniker shift. (This TLDR needs a TLDR)**



A monthly guided meditation, both informed by and expressed through the conceptual framework of the Tarot. 

Each audio contains field recordings and compositions from that month, culminating in a personal ritual of audio scrapbooking at the full moon, which includes the recording of the free-spoken “reading” you will hear; a single take of improvised musings of the heart in that present Moment, at the closing of the cycle with all of its last month’s weight to lift, intended to provide some sort of cathartic sensory mirror, or interpretive auditory canvas, or darkened communal space for each and any or all of you to fill with the light of your own awareness. Or something? 

everything has, and is, and always will be changing 

and I’m headed toward an annoyingly admin-heavy moniker shift but one that I feel has been needed for a long time 

It’s not my legal name just yet (but spoiler alert just straight up callie rose petal is indeed the end point of the creative entity nomenclature trajectory, which has an alchemical reasoning behind it; and all of this is far too much to get into in this post, but soon) 

But in the first instance I wanted to truly embody every aspect of my authentic self, including my magickal practice, into my creative home here on Patreon with this active decision to introduce a new tier and dedicate my time to Presence, to see what comes of it each month, and to share that with you precious trusted folks 

I have found only just recently, that sheer vulnerability is not necessarily virtuous. There is no catharsis or healing for anyone in vomiting out absolutely everything, and in fact the crucial lesson to be learned is how to choose, how to consciously curate which chunks to regurgitate, for the sake of one’s own energetic, emotional, physical resources, for those of Other, and subsequently for the utility, the remedy, the magick of the opus
