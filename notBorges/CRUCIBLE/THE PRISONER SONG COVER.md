Drinking cum from a cup made from loneliness plus cigarette butts   
That used to be freedom to me 
Watching cartoons while high 
To escape the dysphoria inside 
That used to be freedom to me 

And then I found a light 
And it hurt my eyes cus it was so bright 
And it said hey be dumb with me 
Watching cartoons and ly-
Ing upon your heart underneath your arm 
It seems to be freedom to me 

And now it’s plain to see 
The light’s reflective quality 
And I was really lying in my own loving arms

And freedom is what happens 
When you finally allow 
Your heartbeat to restart
