G D Em A7 C D
 
[Verse]
G            D                 Em
It's nice to hear your voice again
A7
I've waited all day long,
C                         G
Even wrote a song for you
                  D               Em
It's strange the way you make me feel.
A7
With just a word or two
            C               G
I'd like to do the same for you.
 
[Interlude]
G D Em Am C D
 
[Verse]
G            D               Em
It's nice to hear you say hello.
A7
And how are things with you?
C           G
I love you.
          D                Em
But very soon it's time to go.
A7
An office job to do
C                                G     D
While I'm here writing songs for you.
 
B7                   C
Strange how a phone call can change your day
         G     B7
Take you away, away
         C
From the feeling of being alone
 
Bless the telephone
 
[Interlude]
G D Em Am C D
 
[Verse]
G             D              Em
It's nice the way you say my name
A7
Not very fast or slow
C                      G
Just soft and low, the same
            D               Em
as when you tell me how you feel
A7
I feel the same way too
C                          G    D
I'm very much in love with you.
 
B7            C
Strange how a phone call can change your day
         G     B7
Take you away, away
         C
From the feeling of being alone
             G       C
Bless the telephone
             G
Bless the telephone
