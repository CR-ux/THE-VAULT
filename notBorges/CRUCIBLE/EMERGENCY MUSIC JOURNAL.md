happy birthday mum 

chorus:   
all the things you taught me 
all the things you bought me 
i could never love anyone more 

mama 
i love ya 

crawling through this maze for ants 
taking time to iron my pyjama pants 
the kitchen filled with music food and love and dance 
telling me you love me every single chance


spending all the sunny time beside the sea 
bacon as a crustacean delicacy 
listening to my piano patiently 
cultivating all the things waiting for me 

all the things you taught me 
all the things you bought me 
i could never love anyone more 

mama 
i love ya 

then we had to move away to live our lives 
but the kitchen is a place we hold inside 
every living human, every child 
is both the passenger and the ride 
with every wave and rising of the tide 
even from the shore you’re standing by my side 
and you can be sure you’re always on my mind 
even from the shore you’re standing by my side 

all the things you taught me 
all the things you bought me 
i could never love anyone more 

mama 
i love ya 


I’ll make them see me (trans witch song for musical) 
(does she change others’ genders or change their perception of hers?)

i think i’m meant to ent

gender is religion 
and about me, the devout 
red velvet rope umbilical 
to keep us heathens out 


and the room filters out
the room drains out 
the room sputters out 
and i 
am left wishing for a boy 
who will bring me blankets and tea 
when in the book i am reading 
my favourite character dies 



i didn’t have to tuck 
my fear awny 
i didn’t give a fuck 
I 



stop making me feel wanted 
i’m not wanted at all
stop setting my heart up
for a fall

because the bottom should always come first 
and this a bottom that gotta lotta thirst
so do your Wurst


joanna newsroom cover album 


we started off 
a pair of men 
i’d never looked 
in the mirror then 

we never met 
we never met 
we never met 

And when we finally did 
You accidentally called me 
Baby 
Like you did in the past
Like no time had passed 

But When I heard Win singing about supersymmetry 
I knew he was a previous iteration of me 
And I’ve thought for so long about quantum mechanics 
how it must be the cause of our mental gymnastics 
and it’s nearly been a year by the window 
Reading books, a sad early mourning widow 
sleeping through the afternoon 
only talking to the moon 
He was right, all of my stories 
Are preferable to our memories 
But you weren’t living 
in my mind 
You were still so painfully 
alive 
While I was rotting in my prime 
I had lost all grasp on time 
but that’s exactly what i needed 
The only thing that could have superseded 
you, my little once was darling 

Is the root of the truth in the heart 
within 

and now the night hues 
are imbued with a sense of light 
Quite united, 
Quiet, untied 
the strings pulling the strings 
Were knotted long ago 
They protrude from the depths inside 
the muddied footprints of your ego

There is a voice that tells you things 
It tells us all we are not worthy 
and for those with more self esteem 
it will become their identity 

The voice is programmed like a computer 
it can only work on the instructions 
I wish I’d looked inside me sooner 
to find humanity’s destruction 

It’s clinging to the Self you’ve forged 
through intellect, physique, material 
superficial depth, the mind lies gorged
Positively endothelial 

The eyes delighted to frighten 
Your retinal display has a way 
Of filtering all the possible light 
words unsaid in salivary splay

There are worlds we cannot hear 
These act as a mere sentinel 
The senses trick you, skin to ear 
transferring energy to chemical 

So for the Truth with a capital T 
look within the smallest You
That pervades not just your body 
But all elementary particles too 

Don’t you think there is a reason
We aren’t allowed to see down there 

the act of observation collapses the wave function 
banister peeling off the stair 

Our safe little world of sensory input 
Has forever been the Human Way Out 
but now my puppet strings are cut
The Way In’s all I  think about 

All the world religions 
and the mysticism too 
Were built upon the same foundation 
and wrecked by bombs the ego threw 

Trying to apply the mind 
to the feeling I have now 
will only bring about the madness 
I’ve misunderstood somehow 

You are so not broken, beauty 
this is just not real 
when you live in a society 
that’s as broken as you feel 

the concepts of good and evil 
were invented by the brain 
the brain likens itself to shakespeare 
writing endless farce we play 

Every moment is a lesson 
Every feeling goes much deeper 
I’ve been holding on to tension 
put there by a False Scorekeeper


the incessant bell will ring until 
you make the choice to listen 
at which point, upon recognition 
the toll’s controlled from within

We tend to find the partner who 
will help us act out each comedy 
but then we desperately run through 
each history and tragedy 


You thought you could beat my soul 
make me forget i’m part of a whole 
converging on the Trees of Britain 
I am so much more than what i’ve written 
You will never read the words 
you can’t even read the letters: 
the basic material for ideas to fit in 
can be further reduced to linework within 
and the lines reduced to black or white 
a duel of darkness versus light 
the binary of molecular knitting
the empty abyss tied up with a ribbon
The words can’t portray what is written 
The archetypal hero meets the villain 
Thought you could lock me in the prison 
My ego built, but I’m not submitting
You won’t distract me from my mission 
I quit neurosis, I quit my quitting 
I quit my guilt because it’s hidden 
the light inside my organism 
You can’t beat me, I’ve been forgiven 
You can’t beat me, I’ve been forgiven 
AND YOU WILL NEVER BEAT PIP CRITTENS 
and you will NEVER BEAT PIP CRITTENS 
you’ll NEVER BEAT PIP CRITTENS 
YOU’LL NEVER BEAT PIP CRITTENS 

The more you identify 
with the selves you keep in flight 
the more you lose the magic 
of an innocent child’s sight 

and if you try to grasp the orbs tighter 
You will never be the juggler 
in fact since i was 18 years lighter 
i’ve always been a poi spinner 


The secret is to keep them up 
as a fleeting spark! They’re Ego 
To clutch the orb for one more second
is to trap your Self in limbo 

You are not the things you like 
You are not the things you want 
You are under, you are Other 
You are the serif of the font 

The angle of the serif 
the shade of black it’s in 
the light absorbed by the black 
and contained so tight within 

Most importantly you’re not 
the thoughts that rush your veins
you are LISTENING to the thoughts 
you have the stillness, take the reins 

the serpent is no demon 
she comes upon surrender 
she approaches those who practice love
and kills what you remember 

she kills ‘you’, but ‘you’ must go, blind 
the scripture predicted apocalypse 
is not the ending of mankind 
It’s the Ego on a crucifix 

Underneath the programming 
is an immutable processing core 
One that tells us Us is Them 
What’s theirs is ours and mine is yours 

Connection, that’s the real survival 
I have already died twice 
first body then mind death revival 
and my programmed ‘self’ was terrified 

They scrape at my insides 
The sad, abandoned clown 
bringing revelations 
that i can’t even write down 

Each church along my spine 
but most the church of [**Thyatira**](https://www.biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=revelation+2:18-29)
is heated now so warmly 
and sights are rendered so much nearer 

the religion of Ego on Earth 
will fight wars and terrorise it 
but the shape of you as water 
gives no thought to what confines it 

the way my mum and dad love me 
the way a puppy loves to play 
the way a baby laughs at a leaf 
the way the night bows down to day 

it is the shape of you 
heracliteusian flux of water 
it is the sense of you 
as your great grandmother’s 
great granddaughter 

Has anybody ever read a science book?
Hello? We came from One 
I woke up for the first time today 
And stretched my branches in the Sun

when it comes down to it 
you are what you believe 
so why not believe the truth
welcome death’s farce, do not grieve 

welcome suffering’s illusion 
a lesson wrapped in bloody rags 
after all, magma intrusion 
formed the salisbury crags


The Upanishad of the Forest of Wisdom 
Calls it the Imperishable one
It is the knower, though unknown.
Each quantum thread the Sum 

It is without attachment, without taste, smell or touch,, 
without eyes, ears, tongue, mouth, breath, or mind,
without movement, without limitation, without inside or outside 
The imperishable is the seer, that sheds the body and leaves the eyes behind


[Verses: Amaj, Emaj, Dmin, Amaj
A maj, Emaj, Dmaj….(Amaj) x2

Refrain: Amaj, Dmaj, Amaj, Dmaj…]

Thanks to my creative dad (who is an engraver), I was a child of many names. Pigling bland, The Reverend T J Clackett, CJ Fly, Pip Crittens, SuperCal… The list goes on… I still to this day don’t know the origin of most of the names. I think my songwriting also came from my dad because he would sing little theme songs to go with some of the nicknames, for example:
“Flying through the air at the speed of light, 
SuperCaaaaaaaal!”
“You’ll NEVER BEAT pip crittens!!!”
Just, amazing. 
He was with me at every open day for every university, and took me to every interview. It was a really special time to be able to share together. 
When I moved up to Edinburgh for my PhD, my dad being the generous soul he is drove the hundreds of miles in his small car stuffed with all my possessions and instruments (we sadly had to leave the cello behind). During the few days he stayed with me, he kept mentioning Anfield, the Liverpool football stadium, and how there is a giant banner/plaque thingy that the team all touch on their way out to the field, to intimidate the opposition and build confidence. I thought it was an interesting story, but I did wonder why he kept mentioning it because he knows I’m really not that into football. 
The time came for him to leave, and he reiterated the story to me again. Okay, I thought, this has to have some cryptic meaning (my dad is whom I inherited my love of puzzles from) - but before I could figure it out he was at his car getting ready to drive back. I closed the door and looked up at the doorframe above it. There was the engraved plaque that you see in the cover art for the track. “YOU’LL NEVER BEAT PIP CRITTENS”
So, in the song and in my life now, ‘Pip crittens’ is a state of mind, back to childhood when every minuscule thing holds wonder and beauty, and everybody holds love within their heart. Because they do, it’s just sometimes harder to find.  I couldn’t help but cry during the song and i decided to keep the take because of its childish authenticity and also holy fuck when my dad left and I saw the plaque I cried like crazy. 
Every morning when I leave the house I touch the plaque, 
it builds my confidence 
it intimidates my opposition
And what bigger opposition do any of us have than our Ego? 
Happy Father’s day, dad 
Thank you for everything 
x


the dwindling concepts of Hope and Fear 
were invented by the brain 
which tends to liken itself to shakespeare 
writing endless farces we inevitably play 

But every passing moment is much more like dickens
Every feeling goes much deeper 
I’ve been 
holding on 
to tension 
put there by a False Scorekeeper

And Charles was one to teach a lesson 
To the powerful few who thought they knew 
To show the many how redemption 
Will come to those who just  remain True

the incessant bell will ring until 
you make the choice to listen 
at which point, upon recognition 
the toll’s controlled from within


You had bought the upright piano 
and I was playing chopsticks 
A new dog on its way to India 
learning the Polish master’s old tricks 

Then you bought the baby grand 
and I wasn’t a baby anymore 
i’d learned the Beethoven and the greats 
I thought by then I knew the score 

But nobody ever really ever does 
Even those who play on steinways 
Can look within them, find the bars
developed in their childhood days 
     
now it’s toodle, Pip, to the blindness 
Only distance left to remind us 
The weekends we spent on the train 
I don’t ever think it rained and if it did i never noticed

You told me the knowledge of my knowledge 
is what kept you going through 
And years, years later I think you knew 
All I cared about back then was the time with you 

And now I’m up high in the north I touch the plaque and double back 
every breath returns me to the source the double helix union jack 

Every molecule of every twist 
in every heart of every cell 
the genetics of this geneticist 
is the heart you gave to love me well 

and in the sea, in the pearl of the shell 
and in the air, in the wind, do you dwell 
In every memory, every sight and every smell 
When I love myself, I know that’s you wishing me well 

Underneath the Ego’s reign Pip crittens is stirring up again 
nothing will ever ease the pain except the link the link the link of the chain 

the immutable Self in which you believed 
can feel only love, at peace, never grieve, 
so free
the mind from the prison of false identity 
we are all one, but especially
especially you and me 

And intellect is nothing given 
To gain ‘worth’ from it was my prison 

Inside the unobtained achievement ribbon 
Is the Self who’s function is forgiving 

At the back of what I’ve done 
There is the knowledge of you 
At the front of what I know 
There your love grows as bamboo  

and with you, every 
every day —
I’m with you every
— day is like Sunday 
With you, my Expectations 
can only be Great 
even Half The World Away *clap clap*
through Ring Cycles  
through Ring Cycles of each passing day 


I’m flying through the air, at the speed of light 
(SuperCal!)
I’m flying through the air, but never out of sight 
(SuperCal!)
The reverend T J clackett ordained in a barn 
(SuperCal!)
Where out flew Pigling bland on a string of yarn 
(SuperCal!)

We are all so much more than we have written 
But I hope this song will act as a temporary sit-in 
while I’m half the world away on the other side of Britain 
THEY WILL NEVER (ever, ever) BEAT PIP CRITTENS
THEY WILL NEVER (ever, ever)  BEAT PIP CRITTENS 
Because of all the strength you’ve given 
They will never EVER EVER beat pip crittens 
Every day I feel LOVE within 
Because of al the time you’ve kindly given 
And as I played you’d cook and you’d intently listen 
Knowing that I’d always, always be pip crittens
knowing that no-one could ever 
BEAT 
PIP
CRITTENS

YOU WILL NEVER BEAT PIP CRITTENS 
you will never beat pip crittens 

I will always 
be 
pip crittens

With what majesty and simplicity 
Does the mind label the body 
- [ ] And grasp at a form of identity 





have the AUDACITY 
have the bravery 
to demand no less than feeling 
deny yourself none of it 
it is your emotional teacher 
the body will seize and pulsate, 
the mind tense and quake 
have the courage 
to deny yourself nothing 
even suffering 
it is your physical teacher 
have the resolve 
to revolve
through the cycles of life 
which spiral out and backward in again 
to return to that place where nothing 
that is real  
can be threatened 
it is your teacher's teacher 

open the chest 
to the rest of the world 
that you are blind to from experience 
have the sight 
to demand the light 
to illuminate your inner body
it is your student 

have the audacity 
and have the strength of will  
to insist on the acknowledgement of love 
in every helix of your nucleic acid 
it is your geometry teacher 

and it is the shape of you as water 
that fills every space
with no thought of the confines 
it is the shape of you immutable 
yet constantly in flux 
it is your spirit's teacher



Act 1: Muladhara
it’s taken me lil now to realise 
I am
born from the dust on the dust on the coat of the lamb 
the nucleic body being transferred to an empty somatic cell 
alone i resided and despised the microtubule bars from inside of my hell 
I was 
being carried unshaved by my primary school name 
to the place from where my consciousness came 
to a torture chamber’s makeshift throne 
to the drone of an unearthed wire 
to the feminine shoot of the masculine root
hidden buried deep under St Giles’ Spire
An unwilling supporting character in my own life’s satire 
none of my most fundamental needs  being met 
I was A mere thread being plucked from their net
But the two red petals unfurled 
And the air violently hurled 
past my teeth, my epiglottis,
see, yet i got it 
out of my
Lung.

Act 2: Swadhisthana
and at the ancient burial site 
that became the campus of the state of Calliope 
the grain of sand that grew to the Longest Beach 
That blanketed then hardened to impenetrable glass 
That did nothing but refract, not reflect the past 
And in the Cruelest month of ’94 there was a Spring 
But the sunlight came and evaporated the thing 
And then a prescription for a pill to kill 
the difference labelled as an ill 
but all it did was strip the passion 
turning vibrant orange ashen 
Oh, Puvunga.

Act 3: Manipura 
Mo chroi, our sinking voyage aboard Navel ships 
we packed our whole lives and yet still weren’t equipped
A yellow slick lip of fire from the east  
Ablaze as vikings pilgrimage t’wards peace
The waves from the Son intermeshed in a plexus 
Our co-dependent origins in bondage of nexus 
Did I manipulate you into a statue of a contortionist?
Ex-exhibitionist, did I lock you in? to the museum of my lips? 
and I made the mistake of thinking fondly in absence 
Oh Iris, I risked thy shipboard duty 
upon the arc’s dazzling beauty 
on the lens of my lie in the sky’s prism of refraction
my life without Ewe became a gargantuan abstraction 
And my hands clasped so tightly, 
sweaty from fear of the heavenly fall 
from a bamboo ladder creaking, 
shrieking “Jacob wasn’t this tall” 
And something clicked, I slipped 
my clown feet swung 
with the rapture of fracture 
of the rib of each 
Rung.

Act 4: Anahata
Lyubov moya, preserver and destroyer of my chlorophyll-filled chest 
I thought I conjured up an injury
A directorial spell that May cast me unwell 
my anti-Body 
was rejecting me 
It was in the air, the care i felt for Other 
I should mirror, turn inward the love of my mother
And Goddess how shadow was ingested and loved 
how we were but a shooting star, short, bright: Lyubov! 
forgiving is akin to a hyacinth
green STEM and blue flower sprouts out of muddy sin
fading proof of the soul violence on the skin
Go back to unfettered cross-legged hymns being sung 
back to the sole through the cycles of old, to the youngest of 
Young.

Act 5: 
Dearest no longer, the rest of you was in my throat 
so long after you’d paddled so far west of the boat 
extinguished with such a painfully satisfying sound 
inaudible over the horizon where a Blue estuary wound
where you had escaped the fear of being found 
where you stayed and I prayed that you hadn’t drowned 
You went in but you would not go out 
i was terrified what my life might be without
fear, and sickness, and tactility drought  
through a corridor of trees 
infinite photographs of me 
all the ‘he’s that i had been 
and all the ‘shes and they’s that i could be
Oh wherefore, Nature didst thou place upon my path a lion’s mane 
Since lion vile hath here deflowered my fear, which is, no, was the picture frame 
in which my portraits 
Hung.

Act 6: Ajna 
The microcosm we colonised alone 
was a close imitation of home 
our six eyes knew what was fundamentally wrong 
you chose to be blind, i misconstrued that as strong 
the terminal ratchet clacked in a one-way motion 
The drought brought about a thirst for the ocean 
So much time passed between and indeed through us 
lighting our souls for a moment, candles in the cosmos 
my deepest exhale had extinguished the flame 
and I thought I was the only one to blame 
from what was once your pillow billowed a smoke of heavy colour
I got out of bed, and dressed, couldn’t mess with that indigo any longer 
I’m so sorry I made you feel even moreso alone 
my lesson; my transgression: was your not feeling at 
Home.


Act 7: Sahasrara 
When they crowned the queen of the underworld 
She wore a choker on Her neck made of pearls 
each sphere a mere memory of your face 
and i was the thread that tied them through space 
completely frayed, derelict and unpicked from my net 
so long ago was the trawl from the fall easy to forget  
Diane is a plan for all of Man to be brave 
brave enough to unwind, unafraid to be kind
And I’d been away, so far away from my body 
and I think this is the start of something just for me 
Impossible for anybody else to see 
it shouldn’t bother me if you think that sullies its validity 
it’s ruthless to be truthless in this world of inequity 
i’ve been robbing people of my individuality 
and i know the next time you see me 
I won’t resemble what you once thought of me 
I may be a weeping willow tree 
but I’m learning to grow the greenest leaves 
and violently flowers are sprouting beneath 
around my trunk, your remembrance wreath 
in bloom all at once, springing
joyful and fun, clinging 
tuned to the Sun, bringing
life, dooming everyone, stinging
with fumes of oxygen, singing:
Ogum Satyam Om



First step physical body taken over 
Then mental body 
Then spoil ed by turmoil in the soul

notice how 
somehow 
you haven’t died yet 
an  d that might 
be for a reason
it’s time now 
to allow 
the fish out the net 
and the night 
is but a season 





 




have you noticed how somehow you haven’t died yet and how that might be for a reason?
have you noticed how even though everything seems hopeless you still manage to see another season? 


In 1974, clinical psychologist Alan Krohn published a paper entitled “Borderline ‘Empathy’ and Differentiation of Object Representations: A Contribution to the Psychology of Object Relations.” In the paper he argued, based on clinical material, that his borderline patients were extraordinarily attuned to the emotions of others, to the degree that they often felt things that other people were unaware they themselves were feeling. They were often able to intuit “very private impulses and judgments in other people.”
Yet it was not empathy itself which earned these patients a borderline diagnosis. Rather, it was their weak sense of self and ego organization, which left them at the mercy of their emotions with very little ability to reflect upon them or bring reason to bear upon their judgments of others. While at times the borderline is uncannily correct about other people’s feelings or the “emotional atmosphere” in the room, at other times they are deeply, profoundly wrong—especially when they fail to differentiate between their own feelings and those of others, or when they bring a rigid, caricatured set of emotional responses to everyday social interaction.
Upon delving more deeply into patients’ life histories, Krohn discovered that many of these patients were deeply sensitive, empathetic children whose abilities had been exploited and manipulated by parents with severe emotional difficulties. These parents often made the borderline child into a source of constant gratification of their emotional (and at times sexual) needs, and abandoned or violently turned against the child if they refused to be used in this way. As a result, the child never developed a firm sense of self independent of others and became a hypervigilant scanner of the emotions of people around them both so they could fuse with them (and thereby maintain relationship) or violently reject them (thereby protect themselves from abuse and further exploitation). It's important to stress that the borderline’s characteristic practice of “splitting” others into all-good or all-bad objects is a repetition of behaviors they learned from parents or other caregivers who did this to them repeatedly as they grew up.
In other words, borderline personality disorder is a kind of malformation of a person’s empathic capacity. Empathy is one tool among many that healthy people use to make decisions and grow relationships with others. The borderline, however, is enslaved by empathy, which leads them at times to radically disregard it in a bid to protect themselves by abusing and lashing out at others. In those moments, a borderline person finds it very difficult to imagine or feel what those around them may be feeling.
This is why healing from borderline personality disorder is all about learning to use empathy in more centered, balanced way. Rather that the extremes of being completely overwhelmed by what others are feeling and then completely cutting off awareness of what others are feeling, the patient must learn how to observe others’ emotions while remaining their own person—with their own feelings and thoughts, especially when they are feeling strong emotions. This psychological separation from other people is a coming into integrity. It helps the patient feel like they exist in the world as separate individuals, not just as extensions of other people. It helps them learn that healthy relationships allow both people to be who they are, so that no one is burdened with having to manage the emotions of anyone else. And most importantly, it helps the borderline take responsibility for themselves—rather than feeling impossibly responsible for others while blaming those others for things which are their own responsibility.

to be ridiculed by a fundamentally broken society suggests a wholeness 



baby boy its true i still love you 
i thought that you knew that much was true 
lying behind a blue curtain alone 
thinking how ihad lost half of my home 

an ovum is an exit, from which to germinate
i thought my body had devised a way to menstruate 
clear to me the heart’s a lonely hunting creaking gate 
to be opened on a closing pulse, formidably too late 




Time to strip the sheets and wash the bad decisions out 
Events are connected like beads on an elasticated string 
I know by tomorrow evening i’ll be taking my sheets off again 
Replacing all the bad decisions with more i’ll regret 

i will shower every second 
so i don’t smell like a boy 
and remind myself of you by just existing
i will stop looking for what’s wrong 
and therefore find nothing 
i will stop trying to be someone else 
and know if i am trying to incite a change
then i must know my truest self

i’m an open book but there are way too many chapters 
for anybody to ever know the whole story 
so listen to Lemony and focus on other matters
memento mori 
an ovum is an exit 
a heart a creaking gate 
opened on a closing pulse 
formidably too late 

A curtain falls on the hollow scene 
(dirges for those lost in the holocene extinction)

rhappy birthday 
kaleiopi 
you were born 12 hours ago 
mummy loves you 
daddy loves you   
time to let it go 





so it’s time to learn to crawl then walk then run again 
you can fall that’s really all there is to loving men 
getting back up requires a strength 
brave vibration at a shorter wavelength 

and if you really want to, come inside 
the past is in the past and there’s no better place to hide 
every human every living  child 
is both the passenger and the ride         

my songs will be my children now
i like being inside so the match doesn’t go out
i’ll get by not dying in a crowd 
love as only lobey hearts now how 

time to melt the igloo, drain the lake, 
under let the bathing girl awake
burn the sneering monster at the stake, 
let the scathing hateful mirror break 

there are shadows in the carpet 
silhouettes of secret men
they are whispering things to each other 
things i cannot know 

there is dust in the carpet 
dust i can never vacuum 
it has touched and been skin i will never see again 

the dust 
of 
the dust
    on
    the dust 
vibrates at a discrete frequency 
resonating at a pitch my ears cannot perceive 

there are waves all around me 
passing through me 
that my body has been robbed of the sensation of feeling
or maybe it hasn’t 
and maybe that is why i am transfixed 
feeling skewered every second i am awake 
while sleeping drags the implement 
in endless phallic-y 
out 
out
out
of my lifeless, teeming 
body

and when i am gone i will not be gone
i will become the dust 
of the dust 


but the waves 
are not 
other 
and the only thing stopping me 
from being both particles and waves myself 
is the fact that you and i are here 
to perceive me

i will shower every second 
so i don’t smell like a boy 
and remind myself of you 
by just existing
i will stop looking for what’s wrong 
and therefore 
find nothing 
i will stop trying to be someone else 
and know that if i am trying to change it
then i must know who i am 



merkaba (there, you are) 
 
if i could 
(my life didn’t start on earth)
i would 
(my life started after it ended)
(my life is fractured)
take all these branches and tie them together
(the way i decide)
(i have lived through many lives)
(and still have not learned how to let go)


you have more power thank you think 
(so, here i go)
you have more power than you think 
(i travel, alone)
you have more power than you think you do not need to cut yourself

THERE IS A LIGHT
(my vehicle ascends)
IN MY STOMACH
(my vehicle knows)
it feels like FAITH
(my father’s address)
(my only home)
(my vehicle knows)
(what i cannot be shown)
and I SEE HIS FACE
(the pain of life, the pain of death, the pain)

mumma

(it’s just a symptom, it’s a symptom of this disease)

i remember

(this humanitarian disease)

(that keeps us locked inside these meat bodies)
(i decide to travel)

the love 

(intention is everything)

the love 

(my universe expands)
(and i shrink)


the love 
the love 

(we all sleep on the edge of it)

the love 

(the abyss)
(we have all felt the fall, in)
(and all, woken up)

The utmost fear 
The atmosphere 

 
My pink toothbrush 
Is standing by herself 
My pink toothbrush 
Is standing all alone 
And if my pink toothbrush 
Could brush my heart as well 
Then I could forget the toothbrush 
Of the man I used to know 

I miss you too much 
Smoking all the pot 
I miss you too much 
All the things we’re not 

Two toothbrushes standing I. A pot 
Two toothbrushes standing in a pot 



 I’m sorry 
I’m trying 
To be happy 
To 
Be free 
I’m really trying 
Not to dwell on the dying 
Of all experience 
Of your smell 
On my skin 
Over The craters 
You traced your fingers
Made them smooth again
In my mind 
I was a monster 
I was so unkind 
I am a monster 
so love must be blind 
I live under your bed 
Draw a monster 
More, a mirror 
What makes it a monster?
It lives inside my head 

I live under your bed 
I live inside your head 
Draw a monster
Its a mirror that  needs to be fed 

Mummy 
You did your make up 
I watched intently 
Not believing 
I could fall
But you wrapped me 
Up so tightly 
In a towel that I did 

Daddy 
you never made up 
I listened closely 
To you screaming 
Through the wall 
As we watched the 
Firework show 
I was No longer a kid 

Just hold on 
Your love will be right along 
Just hold on 
It was inside you all along
And It’s so easy to give in but it takes guts to just be strong 
To live is to suffer so why not get stuff wrong 
To learn from it is harder than it is to write a song 
The pill that’s been stuck in all our throats for way to long 
Is why on Earth we’re here on earth and where the hell we’re from 
I have to think our meat bodies are down here for a reason 
that kind of thinking has pervaded human civilisation 
And also caused 
A million wars 
So I don’t really know what to think anymore 

But I know I feel something 
I know that it is growing 
Something I can’t describe 
To a human ear with meaning 
I know that you can’t just observe the empirical data 
I know that we’re the screen, the dream, the dreamer and projector 




Mistki? Fiona? Will? I’m listening 
Jaime? Amanda? Phil? I need you 
Yoni? Lemony? Still, I’m crying 
Still, I’m trying 
Please be with me 
Let the earth know me 
before me 
Before I am set free 
Before I have knowledge 
Before I can see 
Let the mirror break 
Let us drain the lake  
And let the audience see 
The girl beneath  
Who couldn’t breathe 

Its suddenly clear to me I haven’t felt this good in a while 
So apparently I still have the muscles I need to smile 
Leaving the house to look at nice plants and talk about emotions 
Leaving the house to eat sandwiches on a cliff looking at the ocean 

my girls 
you’re my world 
my girls sure know how to make me feel like a girl 
ad when you hold my hand 
i’m in wonderlnd

It looked so big and scary last night in the dark 
And I’d dreamed it all before I know 
I wanted the tidal pool postage stamp to give me all the answers 
And you told me all the answers would still be there tomorrow 

We looked out and listened to elaiza
Remembering we’d met her 
And I told you that you helped me be myself 
Let me know myself better 

We looked out and looked back 
Remembering how we’d met each other 
372.2 miles away from here years ago 
Neither of us even had a clue what the future was holding and what it could show 

And there’s no 
Where else 
I’d rather be than with
you 
Looking at me 

all the fights and the fury no judge and no jury could sentence us 
even now still somehow i’m allowing myself hope’s relentlessness 
after all that i did after all that i put your little heart through 
after all that you did  yet i  truly believed you didn’t do  

while we were perched right on the isthmus 
you wrote on the to do list christmas
gift we received from my mother
in ink to simply “love eachother”

there is no way anymore, like a sponge that’s been wrung 
there is too much 
and not enough 
between us now 

and all our time before, like a song that’s been sung 
i can play it over 
in my head again 

until it’s real somehow

i’m trying hard to care for myself 
i mostly just make myself unwell 
dissecting my heart to wear on both sleeves 
(everyone’s) falling (everyone) leaves 

every
body’s 
falling 

every
body 
leaves

it’s not the future in your mind 
but every moment lost you find 
inside a box that you never close 
inside a life you know you chose 

i find it hard to care for myself 
i mostly just make myself unwell 
but there’s still a place where light gets through 
a hole in my soul that’s shaped like you 









i am such a fearful person
things are bad and then things worsen
but who are who are 
you 
who are who are 
you
