Diagnosed early this year - show letter 


Biggest effect has been on mood, as that was the most affecting part of my ADHD 

I have realised since only a week on meds that the poor executive function and lack of focus from ADHD makes my brain “zoom out” and look at every single emotion and thought at once, which causes such distressing overwhelm that it ends up leading to thoughts of suicide 

On medication I seem to be able to focus on one thing at a time, and that includes thought and emotionality in response to a situation.  This breaks the cycle of rumination and allows me to address problems one by one without becoming overwhelmed to such an intense state
