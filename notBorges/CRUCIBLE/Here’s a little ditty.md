About the genes that made me 
There is a vast Array 
Of molecules that make me this way 

It’s a chain 
A connected chain 
We’re all a part of 
We’re all made up of 

Made of 
A
T
C
G

My DNA 
MRNA 
and if I’m not okay 
Maybe dsRNA 

Inside my nucleotide sequence 
Are archaic viral segments 
Leftover harmless remnants 
Proof of our coexistence 

It’s just a simple chain 
Of which we all are made 
And our telomeres are shoelace ends 
So the 5 and 3 prime ends aren’t frayed 

But they keep on getting shorter 
As we keep on getting older 
And the bases are turned over 
By the Polymerase revolver 

I love my genes 
Though I usually wear skirts 
We can edit our genes 
To make sure nothing hurts 

But things hurt for a reason 
And 


Big thief 7:30 mountain
Csh 10:40 far out
