permalink: I arrived in the garden
---
And a green pixelated spirit 
Was spread about the place 
And turned into a skinny stickman 
Who was thrashing me about
Like a lion with a carcass in its jaw 
And I told them I loved them 
And then it shrunk 
Into a child 


# Behind the waterfall 
Is a blackening tunnel 
And the blackening whitens 
And a pink sepia sky became visible 
And a figure pulls me through 
An anthropomorphic cow headed being 
Reaches into the tunnel 
And pulls me into the underworld 
By my arm 
And we are dancing together
