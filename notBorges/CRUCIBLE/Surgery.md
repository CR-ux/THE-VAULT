Anxiety about



Predictions, assumptions, imagine might happen 


PARTY 

- I often predict I will take up too much space, embarrass myself, appear unkind, uncool, unpresentable, make others uncomfortable with my emotions
- I assume the worst about the situation - an argument will probably happen, some feelings will be hurt, either mine or someone else’s
- I imagine the most complex scenarios and that people won’t want me there or are wishing that6 I won’t turn up 

Worst possible outcome: I lose all my friends and support 

Reality 
- I am confident 
- I am worthy of love 
- I am financially better than I have ever been 
- I have a partner who loves me and I and in a healthier relationship than I’ve ever been in 
- I have a strong support system
- I would never abandon my friends as I imagine they might abandon me 
- I am creative, talented, loved and loving 
- I am incredibly compassionate 
- My anxiety is under control to the point where I can use it to push myself to be a better person \
