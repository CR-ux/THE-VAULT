O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice

Song of Solomon 2:14

And I will remove their blood from their mouth
And their detestable things from between their teeth.
Then they also will be a remnant for our God

Zechariah 9:7
