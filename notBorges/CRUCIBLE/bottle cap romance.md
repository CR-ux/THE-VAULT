<span style="color:#000ff;">i left the house today</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">despite the overwhelming feeling of this is not okay</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">i opened the front door</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">i asked myself what are you doing this for</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">i looked in the mirror</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">the voices in my head said what are you doing this for</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">i'\ve got my music to keep me warm</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">tonight was the first time</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">in a long time</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">that i felt okay</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">tonight was the first night</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">i felt okay without you sat opposite me</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">and i needed you</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">to know that</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">ill kiss all my friends and rip down every barrier</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">until i get closer to myself</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">i think iâ€™m close to finding them</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">And I hope you get the help</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">I tried my hardest to give you</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Now WE HAVE TO HELP OURSELVES</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">*crescendo*</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">i want to get inside you and feel your beating heart and rip it out and make good art i want to breathe fire over every sheet of paper in the world and watch it burn watch it all just fucking burn and then maybe i'll have done something that matters after all</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">because i matter</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">i matter</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">i really fucking matter</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">and i don't want you to show me i want to find out for myself</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">i want to open my front door</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">but i can't because i've lost my fucking keys again i wonder when i'll be someone someone could viably adore</span> 





<span style="color:#000ff;">piano covers</span> 
 <span style="color:#000ff;">now I'm everyone</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">what the hell am i thinking</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">unrequited love</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">hide and seek</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">bloody mother fucking asshole</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">love will tear us apart</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">uncomfortably slow</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">it's my own cheating heart</span>



<span style="color:#000ff;">i wish i was different</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">i wish i could look at myself in the mirror</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">i wish you would like me</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">but i don't even like me</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">i wish you were different</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">maybe then you'd see me</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">i wish i was okay</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">i've got a pen that works</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">i keep it in my shirt</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">i never end it to anyone else</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">in case yours runs and and you need a new one and i can be of help</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">my lips are a story</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">you don't know anything about</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">i wish i was different</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">but I've always been different</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">i guess that's the problem</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">and the solution</span>
