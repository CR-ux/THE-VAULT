A genderless burger experience 



Keep adding layers of tape recorded instruments  processed with the deck 



| Timestamp | Note |
| -- | -- |
| Approx 19min | Need to add some bright texture to this section to cheer it up, it’s very scary currently - don’t want to take away from the fact that this whole section is made by tink though; could maybe add some accordion; or maybe it needs percussion - can make a drum kit from tape recorded instruments |
| Around 23min | Revise Motown sample - is it necessary ? does it add anything ? |
| around 26min | Dark section following Motown sample: string loops from other cassettes would work; make recordings in tracks in session view - perform in this section using session view |



Use motif from melodica in dark section but with multiple string & brass tape recordings harmonising
