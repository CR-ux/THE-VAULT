Finding myself 
Thinking about windows again 
And screens again
And mirrors 
Again
I am 
Being myself 
Being the window again
Membranous metaphor 
Hot molten earth 
Turned 
transparency 
I’m remembering again
Am I?

I am 
Finding myself 
Thinking again 
Carrying water 
and chopping down trees 
Mycelium seeping 
Whispering secrets 
Of endings
through cracks 
To begin 
again 

I am 
But
We are 
And never were 
to be 
again 
I am finding myself 
Or I am not I 
A closed window 
To an open soul 

I am 
Yet 
to find myself 

Crouched naked 
under moonlight 
Upright 
and ululating 
Downright 
howling uglinesses at the night again 

I am 
Yet 
I am not 
What you 
Find yourself 
thinking 

I am 

That I 
am 
That I 
were a man 
I would hold his heart 
In the marketplace 

And
Through the soft
Often held 
breath 
of a window 
I find myself 

Being 
Again 


But I don’t want my window open anymore
I am cold
