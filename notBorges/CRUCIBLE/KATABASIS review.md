There’s little question that Callie Rose Petal’s Underworld Opera, *KATABASIS* has developed a significant following and spoken to a select crowd of fans and vitally woefully underrepresented and respected communities.

An operatic performance communicated in seven parts, complete with orchestrated electronics and distortion effects, the path through the Underworld, past the follies of Icarus and the might of Arachne and beyond is littered with referential elements of the great Greek tragedies, all tied directly into the vulnerabilities and experiences of us real-world mortals.
