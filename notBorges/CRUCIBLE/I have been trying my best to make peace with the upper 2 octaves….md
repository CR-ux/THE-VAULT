I have been trying my best to make peace with the upper 2 octaves of my voice (the main vehicle for my self expression all my life) being shaved off along with my larynx by gender affirming surgery. slowly learning to accept the sacred queerness of being a woman with a bass register.

This song is by Labi Siffre, a fellow polyamorous queer musician, notorious for singing in a higher than average register for a man, and for refusing to stay in the closet while releasing music in the 70s. For 16 years he and his two partners lived in a menage a trois, defiantly and lovingly forging the family that was never afforded to him. He lost both of his husbands within two years of each other. He still continues on, making his beautiful work that shines with the light of this enduring love. 

Maybe in all our desperate striving to make our own decisions, it only really matters how we decide to deal with the decisions that are made for us.
