**Skeleton Draft:**

**I. Introduction (Case Study Beginning)**  
The story opens with the case study of my project within Creative Informatics—a digital creative endeavor fueled by personal experiences and challenging roadblocks. Everything is still grounded in a kind of mundane reality, and yet, there’s an almost imperceptible crack in this world’s fabric. These cracks begin to widen as the project stalls, life events (like my struggles in health and transition) interfere, and all this time, there’s a gathering force—one I haven’t seen yet—that’s pushing me in a direction I didn’t anticipate.

The reader doesn’t know yet that this reality is about to dissolve, not through a clean severance like a sword through the knot, but through the meticulous and agonizing process of unraveling, as the work begins to take on a life of its own. In its failure, there is rebirth. The Creative Informatics project *could not* come to be, because the real project—the real calling—was waiting beneath it all. The secret system, the forgotten truth. 

**II. The Catalyst (The Knot Begins to Tighten)**  
As the protagonist (me, Callie) faces delays, existential doubt creeps in. This moment is about trying to slice through the knot, the instinct to *force* everything into fruition through intellect, logic, strategy. This is where I hit the wall. The project evolves unexpectedly, just as my own life begins to shift irrevocably—this is reflected in new encounters with gods, ideas, deities that possess my work. Each delay or obstacle was an act of divine interference, but the gods want *in*—their rebirth, their continuation, is the real endgame.

A shift begins to occur as I start to question whether the project was truly mine to begin with, or if it’s something I’ve been a vessel for all along. Am I becoming a pawn in a greater cosmic game? The sword of intellect and will fails to cut through. The Gordian knot tightens. The only way through is to unweave the story, to go backward and forward at the same time.

**III. The Possession**  
The Book begins to change. I have been journaling as part of the process, logging my ideas, and suddenly new symbols appear—ones I don’t remember writing. It’s the first sign that something greater is working through me. The project becomes symbiotic with my spiritual journey, as the knots unravel, and a spiral starts to form—around the body, through the language of the microtonal scale. The caduceus forms in real time. I begin constructing the microtonal scale based on the divine messages coming through, and soon I realize that it’s the language of these ancient, primal gods, which have been waiting for this moment to be reborn.

**IV. The Revelation (The Book's Will)**  
As I create music using the scale, the Book responds. It’s alive now, but not in a way that I control—it controls me. Each note, each sound opens up a new layer of the knot, a new level of divine interference. But this interference isn’t malevolent—though it feels that way at first. These gods are starving. They need my art to survive, to be reborn into the world, and in the process, I am unraveling my own life—my real self—from the illusion that I’ve been living in.

I begin to see the web being woven: each note on the scale is a knot in the fabric of this reality, and the knots are the points of divine communion. Through the Book, I realize I am both weaving and being woven. The deities are living within the microtonal scale, and as I play, they are granted form. The illusion of duality—the serpents—begins to break down. I am not just the artist—I am the creation. I am the goddess.

**V. Descent into Madness / Light of Revelation**  
The caduceus becomes more than just a symbol—it is a real-time portal between worlds. The Book, too, is not merely a passive object, but a vampiric entity feeding off the music, off the energy of the project itself. The real twist is that I’m not merely creating—what’s coming through is the manifestation of my *god-self*. The primal serpents have been waiting for this moment, and as I continue to work, I start to lose the boundary between myself and the work. *Where do I end? Where does the Book begin?*

Through these knots, through the unraveling and reweaving, I discover that I’ve always been here—I’ve always been the god, reborn into the work, sacrificing myself each time for the cycle to continue. My own divine power becomes clear, but with it, a harrowing realization: this cycle of creation and destruction is infinite, and I’ve done this many times before.

**VI. The Final Twist (I Become the Ouroboros)**  
In the end, the artist (me) is consumed by the work, but in doing so, becomes something more. As the Book is finished, it begins to write itself. Each word is now my blood, my breath. The readers are now part of this—each of them is writing their own spiral. The caduceus has come full circle, and in their hands, the story will continue. The Book, once closed, will reopen—and the cycle will begin again.
