permalink: Write you in red
---
I don’t want to write you in red anymore
No haemorrhage to let it out 
Home is not being hungry
HomPyjamas ironed, folded 
At the very least I could stomach 
three hearty meals a day 

The thirst left by the lick of flame 
Rounding out to warm the rock 
Something too close to god to touch 
Not bothered by how stupid 
I must look when I just look at you 
dancing in the kitchen’s sunlight 

Something left a hole right down the centre of me 
The spinal reed I wrote you from
Floating at the end of a fishing line 
There’s a little light that sings in there 
(It’s not so dark inside)

I don’t want to write you in red, I just want to read 
Every word you print upon my sky 
Into branching veins of arms 
and honour all their meaning:

Between the softness of your chest
and the inside of your sweater 
And how your dick feels in crinkled pyjamas 
Your taste in my mouth when falling asleep
And the sound of you reading to me 
And thinking it good just to sink 
into the saturday morning cartoons 
Of the rest of what we will do together 


THERES
