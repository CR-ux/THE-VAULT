Iâ€™m at 11:30am 
In theatre 1:30pm 
Should be Out 5:30-6:00pm 

- [x] Need LOTS more antiemetics for coming round from GA 
- [x] I need to have self-administered pain relief please (jaw, speaking obstructed) 
- [x] Surgery times? When will I be out? 
- [x] Night time last surgery was horrible, was misgendered, left for almost an hour with vomit on my bed & waiting for painkillers pressing the call button 
- [x] Partner working 7-3:30am but I NEED them to be able to get into the ward to be able to advocate in the middle of the night especially given the jaw - so i insist please an exception be made for visiting hours (last time they stayed until 10pm when they needed to leave for work)
