ALL OF THE WRONG THINGS ARE COMING UNDONE 
MY BLOOD IS RED AND DRIES BLACK IN THE SUN 
FALLING AND CRAWLING THEN COCKING MY GUN 
WHO KNEW THAT ABUSE COULD BE THIS MUCH FUN



Oh dani, boy - 
The fights they were appalling 
Couldn’t see then 
Just how we used to hide 
When we were young 
And all our flowers dying 
My dani boy 
No longer by my side 

And dani boy 
Yes sometimes I still miss you 
It’s always when 
Someone walks past outside 
And now I’m old 
I’ve found a truth in lying 
All on my own 
With space to sleep at Night

Oh dani boy 
Our life made out of falling 
Into the dust 
Blown over mountansides 
And though you’re here 
You could not be much further 
Oh dani boy 
These bruises they are mine
