I made a mistake 
Please get him out of my head 
I called upon you and hurt myself 
I have hurt to be loved 
I have loved to be hurt 
I made a mistake 
Please get him out of my head 
I cast the darkest spell 
Upon my wretched heart 
I made a mistake 
My weeping prayers were answered by the Lord 
But I called upon him and he did not hear 
I lay my life in front of him 
And It was not enough 
All of this feigned disorder 
To destroy him
I made a mistake 
I have destroyed myself 
To be loved 
I made a mistake 
Please get him out of me 
I am his worst mistake 
I am the stain 
I am the cloth it seeps into 
I am no different than a single petal. 
I am no different than a single leaf. 
I am no different that the single drop of dew that collects upon it.
I am no different than the winter morning in which all of this takes place. 
I am the rotting mulch. 
I am the cold frost on the breath. 
I am the breath itself.
And I am nothing else.
