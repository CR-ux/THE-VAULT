I want all of these modules
- [ ] NewMood
- [ ] CleanSlate
- [ ] this.todo 
- [ ] anchorPalette
- [ ] SYMPHNY
- [ ] CCPHNY
 to feed into the central hub of the 2D sidescroller of waveforms generated by the different parts, 
It’s a todo list, a mood tracker & habit tracker that the user can use all or some of the features at will 

The sidescroller 

The anchorPalette functionality is just the reminder notification that gives the user an entry form to fill in at set intervals should they wish (can toggle this feature on & off) 

Each category (habit, mood or todo) has different contributory algorithms that affect the resulting unit or “measure” (waveform) of the entry, which can then be traversed in sidescroller (stave) view - this shouldn’t be really like a “game” as much as an experience (like Journey, for example) where the memories / emotions / bad or healthy habit tracking data  pop up at the relevant chronological markers . These measures add up to daily “phrases” which add up to weekly “lines” which add up too monthly “cycles” which add up to quarterly “movements” which add up to an annual “symphony”. Public data from accounts is collated to make collective ‘staves’ [waveform view is called ‘stave’ view]

<u>YIN</u>
PASSIVE Data is collected at regular time intervals (as granular as possible without risking performance and risking ridiculously high server costs) recording the state of user’s task list, moon phase + user’s last collected mood data correlation  (newMood state), habit tracking state [(yin) DATA=data that influences sound manipulation parameters but doesn’t produce sound itself ]
<u>YANG</u>
ACTIVE Data is collected at each entry by user  [(yang) DATA=data that actually makes notes / sounds happen ]
This means that a waveform will only be present with user entries present 


Yin+Yang data = composition of waveform 




|  | **YIN** | **YANG** | **NOTES** |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| COLLECTION MODALITY | Regular time intervals | At each user entry | How to ensure scalability & eliminate risk of high server costs for regular data collection? |
| SALT DATA | Tasklist state (number of tasks, completed vs not completed, task list tag & subtag distribution, each tag & subtag with their own effects on sound manipulation params) | Each parameter makes specific sound using Tone.js -rough example: Tag - drone note/octave; subtag - treble note or instrument;  effort - amplitude; priority - filter frequency | This data contributes to previously named ‘CCPHNY’ functionality (sound profile generated by user’s ‘busyness’ / the chaos of their task list  ) - viewable separately on ‘PRIMA’ tab |
| MERCURY DATA | Number of total entries | Journal TextEntry measurements (length, sentiment from NLP) | This data contributes to previously named ‘SYMPHNY’ functionality (musical snapshots generated through sentiment analysis & Tone.js); mercury is spirit, higher divine self |
| SULPHUR DATA | Habit state (equation for days successful / number of habits tracked) | Tracked medication taken ✔️ cravings beaten ✔️ positive habit/exercise done ✔️ | Sulphur functionality is a transmutation of addictions/bad habits into positive life changes e.g. substitution of smoking for exercise - user can set config of app to define ‘base metals’ (negative traits) to turn into ‘gold’ (positive traits) Sulphur is subconscious; habitual animalistic self |
| ALEMBIC DATA | Current moon phase | Mood vs moonPhase | newMood has its own visualisation page/view on the application which shows visually stunning depiction of user’s mood correlation with moon phase over time. |
| ATHANOR DATA | Spread history (minor/major arcana ratio, when each cardinal direction’s corresponding element (north for air, south for earth, west for water, east for fire) maps to the tarot suit (wands = fire, cups = water, swords = air, pentacles = earth) the parameters make for more concordant overall sound, when they divert the params make for more discordance | each card has its own pre-made instrument component, meaning five instruments per cardinal ‘measure’ | Cardinal’ (tarot spread) functionality - four cardinal directions & centre card , functional logic to combine elements using Alchemical Tree of Elemental Tarot magic system |



CRUCIBLE: the input form 


  <u>Stave view :</u>
Built in Unity, this ‘game’ feature is as simple as Chrome’s in built dinosaur playable sidescroller when the 404 error shows up 
But with the feeling of ‘Journey’ by Thatgamecompany
Waveform is a static image like an audacity trace 
User presses q key and the waveform zooms in to become terrain 
Sound begins and user can traverse stave like a sidescroller 



Initial thoughts re: UI:
Globe to click the collective waveform view - the collective waveform ONLY records sounds captured from the parameters of the worlds’ public entries  , not text (the text itself is never public and only ever visible to the user ) 
 
Users landing page is a dynamic list of their own entries with an input box , structured similarly to a social media platform but with only the user’s entries 

Tabs for rePhase (newMood - shows visually stunning data correlations between moon phase and user inputs for mood ), reDo (this.todo plain list / kanban functionality, with toggleable CCPHNY functionality switch; allowing user to hear the current state of sound of their task list) 


The ‘module’ names are simply placeholders for me to know the functionalities to work on during DEVElopment , they will just be integrated as views / pages / parts of the overall reSound application, rather than separate apps 


Also Incorporates Tarot spread (cardinal) fiunctionality which contributes to Yang data 




**Rosin (/ˈrɒzɪn/), also called colophony or Greek pitch (Latin: pix graeca), is a solid form of resin obtained from pines and some other plants, mostly conifers, produced by heating fresh liquid resin to vaporize the volatile liquid terpene components. It is semi-transparent and varies in color from yellow to black.**
