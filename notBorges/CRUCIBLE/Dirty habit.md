The love untold she whispered to herself 
The life unlived she watched on screens 
Hoping for things that will never be 
She'll leave alone 

He inhales his wisdom and his desires 
And regurgitates it back again 
Coughing and spluttering
He cries in the night 
Alone

Hopelessly she reaches for the glass 
Looks straight through her reflection 
The familiar strangers 
She counts them all
Are they alone? 

His attention, his addiction, he changes again 
The craving crumbles in his palm 
An unsatisfying aroma, he spits and forgets 
Leave it alone 

A rush in his pocket, a playful melody 
A touch of her breath, a dull monotone 
He grumbles, she moans 
Maybe tomorrow
She'll leave me 
Alone
