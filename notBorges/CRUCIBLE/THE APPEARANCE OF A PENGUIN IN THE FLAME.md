permalink: THE APPEARANCE OF A PENGUIN IN THE FLAME
---
I do not know if I am clawing at my skin to exorcise the buried old, or if there is something new I am trying to embed within 


II don’t know by what design 
What absurdly inefficient 
Dysfunctional design 
A human being should have to feel like this 
Experience this 

When the birds are singing 

But really, I know 

I know by whose design 
Derives this undeniable
 agony

It’s me 

Back of everything 
Is me 

The me I never see 
I hear 
vicariously 
As a listening non-entity
Through the ways that glistened 
And roads they choose to look at me 
And the benches beginning heralding the
