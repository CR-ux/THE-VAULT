YAHWEH as the gnostic demiurge 
As projected vehicle 
As semaphore 
As gripping, ungrippable thirst 
As missing masculine 
As rejected masculine 
As the feared and so unsure about 
As the feared and still so hopeful for
 homecoming within the midst 
Threshold bold with lip or fist 
Just to be told 
anything, a semblance of a gist 
Of my sins and insufficiency 
The times Iâ€™ve been remiss 
Dear God, or sky, or remembering of bliss:
My twisting is toward you Lord -
Falling short of every precipice, 
And raw 
and sore 
and gristle-torn now 
my whisper ever is: 
Please, just give me anything 
a different thing 
from this
