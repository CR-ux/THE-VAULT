<span style="color:#000ff;">We're both on drugs</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Can you please give this up</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">So we can have nice hugs</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">I love you so much</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">Long for your touch</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">When  you do that thing it gets me so</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Done</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">I'm so done</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Being dumb</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">So let's just have some fun</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">You're done</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Yordan</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Like a piece of fine art in a gallery, complete and perfect to me</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">And this has only just begun</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">You're done</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Yordan</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Being alone and being all sad</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">And dark and twisty inside</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">You're done letting yourself</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Get worked up over things</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">That matter so much less than your health</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Than your life</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Your beautiful life in which I hope I'm your wife</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">And maybe by the time</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">We're 29</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Science will make babies from both of our zygotes</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">And all 4 of us will be tearing the house apart because I lost the TV remote</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">I'm sorry I'm so silly</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">And I lose shit and forget</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">But I know you like my willy</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">And it really makes you wet</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">Darling I love you</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">You know tht it's true</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">I say it so much just to remind you</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">That there is so much light that comes from within you</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">And hits my heart and makes me cry</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Makes me feel actually alive</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Instead of walking through life like a champion from that game you really like</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">Yordan</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">I know You're done</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">With me and all my stupid idiopathies</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Yordan</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">You're done</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Being lonely I'm here for you now</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Through smiling cheeks and furrowed brow</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">I will always love you mister D</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">I can't wait til I'm mr D</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">Oh wait I'm already Mr D</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Maybe it was really meant to be</span> 
 <span style="color:#000ff;">I really can't believe that you make me believe in something that's greater than me</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">Yordan</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">You're done being single</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">There's two of us here</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">And i want to make sure my feelings are clear</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">Yordan</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">You're done being single you belong next to me</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">You're done being single so just Marry me</span>
