Saw notes but sliced at attack points 
Into a harmony 
Pulsing in time with a slow drum 
Stark Silence in between 

Saw notes sliced at screeches and looped in time with quicker drum 
Thick crunchy bassline 



Static 
filtering out 
Left inside 
I wish I could remember 
All their pretty names
I settle for the uniqueness of their semen on my palette 
It is the chasing of the memory of the dream
I never wanted anything real 
Until you lifted up a rotting 
You wound out all my worries 
through the split ends of my hair 




Hark the darkest wind blows 
Cold water drips on hair 
Punky drumbeat 
Saw 4 
String resonance on saw 
Piss hallelujah
