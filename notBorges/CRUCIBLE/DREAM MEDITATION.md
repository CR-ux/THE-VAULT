permalink: DREAM MEDITATION
---
yordan was parking on my street (farman road) and i shouted at him to never come back 

The call to the fall 
Cconaciousness exists within the in between of breath and swallow 
dani featured heavily straight after i meditated into sleep 
he had broken MY laptop and i was asking him to pay for it 
because i felt my life had fallen apart 
this is karmic debt i owe to dani 
This may have been in Khopi or Cornhusk 
there was a man speaking to me, at a family organised gathering, lucy was there, i snapped at her, and apologised for speaking so aggressively; dani showed up with some other friends wearing some kind of eagle mask 
then later i had to lave crying and dani followed me up 
we had a painful conversation in what turned out to be my old room at farman road 
then i left the room again and startsd speaking to that man who was there to help me for some reason, maybe go through my music and listen to it or to make a music video or to help me with my book or something, and i wasn’t listening to him i just kept going out of the room towards dani (now in edinburgh flat) in the hall where i could eee him walking; i was so distracted by my negative feelings, myn clinging onto the past, that i was shutting off my ability to gain new and better more exciting opportunities in music/the arts….. i was hanging on and this closed off doors 

i was applying for financial aassisatcne 
the woman said she’d read 75 % of applications with the same circumstances as me 
the other lady told me just to apply 
i said i felt self conscious 
and explained the 4 year relationship 
she said okay we’ve not had a breakup like that before, with cohabiting etc
i can’t remember if i submitted the application or not BUT they happened int he same dream. I think the Awn is providing me the wisdom that i should apply for the fund regardless - and then pay off the debt and tell dani to use his money to fix his laptop!

Hopefully this is the first step towards karmic retribution.

I expire ced some sleep paralysis before this dream 
At some point, I was in Khopi, on the path with the white accommodation that I normally see from a curved distance. KI now realise tat Khopi is merged with Cornhusk somehow, they are twin cities with a portal between them like a membrane. Ruth, and two others were walking the path pn the other side of the road, and yet i still found myself asking - where is ruth? 


Woke up in Tyxos. i went on a maelstrom-like theme park ride that twisted and turned in impossible dimensions, next to a rolelrcaoste that had fourth-dimensional travel properties 

i was becoming lucid on the ride and able to still it entirely! 
I hadn’t become lucid of the dream, just carried over my mindfulness techniques into the dream world!!! 
Jess was there next to me? She was more of a Ruth/Jess chimera (Kala) 


Then I was in Cornhusk
There was a network of rooms similar to before, some ind of flat system similar to before
dani was managing my shlulders 
jess was in front in a bikini and the skin was making disgusting sounds 
her boobs reminded me of oranges inside a bag 


i was talking about dani and with mariam 
i was apologising profusely to mariam saying i’d been such a terrible friend 
But I didn’t know why I was apologising 
It was entirely fake 
IT WAS ENTIRLEY FAKE 
I WAS FAKING TEARS 
BUT I THOUGHT THEY WERE REAL 
IT WAS A STRANGE SENSE OF KNOWING AND NOT KNOWING THE LIES 
i have become entrenched in lies, we all have but me especially 

I ws apologising so much saying i’d been terrible friend mariam ws alguhng and agreeing but seemed more forgiving than in previous iterations of the dream 
i forgot Maram’s name and called her ‘Karma’ theen I apologised and said I’d been watching a ton of dharma and greg….. Fake, lies, didn’t really care about her it was just about me…. 
talking about dani while he looked at me and laughed about what i was saying 
He had more muscle tone and I felt jealous of his nEw partner because of it
