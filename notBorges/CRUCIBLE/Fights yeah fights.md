<span style="color:#000ff;">It's fine it's only once a night</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">He's only worth three bottles of my time</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">He must be Jesus Christ almighty drinking water made of wine</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">Everything's going to be fine</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">You'll go to university and turn out fine</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">And everything is just fine</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Him in his bed and me in</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Your sister's</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">We sat in the dark</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">On Christmas night</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Nobody thought to turn on the light</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Because nobody could stand</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">For anybody else</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">To see them like this</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">The turkey got cold</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">And the mirror was placed so the old saw the old</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">And silence outside crept in slowly</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">I kicked and I screamed in my dreams that night</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">As a sleigh full of memories flew out of sight</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">Drink a lot less coffee</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Drink a lot less coffee</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">Maybe then you'll get more sleep</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Drink a lot less coffee</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">Just be a lot more easy</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Maybe then you'll get to sleep</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">To the sounds</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">Of your own tiny world breaking</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Or the sounds</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Of your own tiny hands shaking</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">(But they're not so tiny anymore)</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">What is this happening to me for</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Because happiness isn't assured</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">And hey you may never get yours</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">But at least you'll never be bored</span>
