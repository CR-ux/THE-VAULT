permalink: QUEER LOVE DESTROYS FACISM
---
Not gay as in happy, queer as in I HOPE AND FIGHT 
Queer as in Free Palestine, as in Freedom As A Birthright. 
Queer as in, Tears To Water Graves of Roses 
And Queer as in the endless Night 
Queer Us Screaming: “Ceasefire Now”, and Never Ceasing Fire of Numbers 
Because we have them, always have, We Dream Awake As This World Slumbers 
The Queerest numbers Marching, Living Queerness As A Requiem 
Queer as in, “I Never Got To Hold Or Touch Or Love Or Even Kiss Them”
Sermons preaching Queer as in, the God we Build in All our Friendships 
And Queer in Open Eyes of Hindsight 
Queer as in, No Family, but Queer as in We Are One Light!!!!!!
Queer as in, a “Sin” is VIRTUE
Queer as in, Not Knowing When
The Power Will Decide To Hurt You 
And Queer as in, Displacement 
So Queer as to Suffer In Faith
this Queerness is a Homeland 
And Queerness made to Rise Again 
In defiance, standing Hand in Hand 
Queer as in, “Fuck You” of course, 
through Dark that Will Bombard us, 
But Queerness buried under ash of Hate: 
Decides To Love, Regardless
