A pole dancing and/or performance competition 
In a chalet / log cabin with rooms that opened out into a single compartmentalised space 

A Kima-Esque woman in the middle, holding open a sliding door 

Barnie was hiding something, a good surprise 

Because I was at this venue, maybe another place, and B&S showed up in the same car Barnie was driving us down a motorway in the other night in my other dream 

The car pulled in and Barnie looked shocked that I was there, as if they didn’t want to spoil the surprise 

I didn’t know what was going on but I remained present, moving into the inner body 

At some point I mentioned a dream 
How this felt like a dream
And they looked at me, again, surprised 
And I think I knew I was dreaming on some level 
Very close to becoming lucid 

Then, Barnie Sylvia and I were in centre parcs
And it was so emotional that they’d organised this 


Sylvia saw my phone Which was frozen on a screen that looked like Grindr messages 
Asked Barnie and I if we were looking for someone else 
Barnie laughed and said no 
Jealousy gets us all 

It felt like a rewriting of a traumatic space inside myself
