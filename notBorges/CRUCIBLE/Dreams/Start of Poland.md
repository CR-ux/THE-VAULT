Ruth was at the train station 
She had black beetles underneath her fringe
When I saw her she didn’t recognize me 
There was a girl lying on the train tracks 
We helped her up 
Then I put my hair back and she relaxed
I tried to get the beetles off 
They went into my mouth
I tried to cough them all out 
The ones I did had turned white 
And mauve and bright lime green 
They expanded as they took flight 
And collapsed again back to the ground 
Minnesota beetles 

I was in an open space
Living in a public place 
The toilet was a shared affair
And coffee in the centre of the park 
A special company was made 
For creating giant pizza and snickers bars 
The same place housed a great detachment 
That was made of grey sheer brick 
Jessica had just bought it 
And we had come around 
Mariam was at the table 
I told everyone what happened 
Everyone but her went silent 
It was the only time I’d got to tell her 
That she hurt me 

who had organised 
All these parties 
 I suppose it was me 
Quite sad when I think about the reason 
My brain created company 
And sadder still was the meal 
Over a conversation with Brexiteers
Who quickly left once I’d revealed myself 
Three girls on drugs came to take some pizza 
And I gave it to them willingly 
Then started the real weird shit 
A film of some sort 
I watched alone but played a part 
Such is the subconscious territory
A film that changed each and every viewing 
But commonalities prevailed 



Skip to Post apocalyptic time 
Climbing through a shanty town 
Skaters speeding round a sink 
An old lady changed in my perception 
To hide a body so well 
Mastectomy scars as evidence 
That she was just like me 




Third quarter of Poland

Dream about: a steampunk reality in which Lauren didn’t love me becaus I am gay, 
An old friend turns into my father my arm is in pain 
I am inside a simulation I realise as he tells me he does not love me in sign language to make me detach from this place
