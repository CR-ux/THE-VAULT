I shared a flat with my sister 
In Edinburgh 
We lost the entrance 
And realised it was one layer down 



I was buying a cake for Yordan 
It had blue icing 
I didn’t know why I was buying it 
So I cancelled it being made 
I then sat down for a lecture 
But was falling asleep in the lecture 
The guy giving the lecture looked similar to me 
Perhaps it was me in the future 
He was talking about biting the head of somebody else’s horse 
Saying perhaps it’s easier to make fun of a different group of people 
I caught up o him after class and asked 
How do you do that without being offensive 
He didn’t have an answer 
I then tried to stop some women 
Stealing handbags and dresses from a washing line 
This wasn’t the first time I’d dreamt this 
And I was very aware of this 
One of the handbags got stuck to my skin and was incredibly painful to peel off once I realised I was in a dream 
So I trioed to stop thinking I was in a dream

So I asked the ladies which flat numbers the lived in 
They could not answer 
Then suddenly I was with Wiola 
We were in the elevator of what I thought was my flat back home 
With one of the ladies who apparently lived there 
But the roof of the lift was tilting to one side slowly and then all at once 
The cable had broken and had only one left 
Wiola and i were both in a panic 
I tried to press the alarm button but there was only a call button 
The man spoke inwhat I thought we engliah, saying what is wrong 
I told him the lift had broken 
Then we were falling and wiola started speaking in very quick and panicked polish 
The man on the intercom said oh shit oh shit oh shit 
And we were watching the floor get closer 
Wiola kept speaking i think she was praying 
And then we got close to the floor but it slowed down just in time
I had to prize open the doors before it went back up  
Then we got off 
Somebody else got on and the doors quickly closed behind them 
I had to tell the security guard in the lobby of what I now realised was the hotel I was staying in in Poland that the lift had broken
And he got on his walkie talkie shouting to his colleague 
It became clear I wasn’t speaking at all in English, after I realised i’d just told the security guard in Polish what had happened 
I turn around to Wiola 
I think about the time and date 
It’s 7:32pm tomorrow (15th June) 

I say 
I missed my flight 

The shock wakes me up
