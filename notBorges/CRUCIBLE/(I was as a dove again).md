permalink: (I was as a dove again)
---
I never knew 
Such a blue
Or the cold of a puddle seeping through 
the crack in the sole of my oldest shoe 
Could be this true 
or beautiful 

A blue this blue will creep in rudely
(Or at least, I think it used to)
Spewing hues of its cooling power 
Carrying a weight of the desolate hatred 
Crushing every sighing thing I am

But this whisper had been clothed in white 
And dressed in black the screams
And a bruised and bloody, hairy knee 
From falling onto floorboard seams 
And something, hanging in the balance
The thinnest, sweetest plumb line ends 
With a dense and sensory suspense 
Woven into tight right angles 
Sticky webs of my hundred selves 
And walked, without a thought, straight through - 
Unasked for strands of kisses laid 
With static crackle on a cheek
and dissolved from all discerning sight 
Torn into flailing strands to trail behind one in the rain 
Not a single cracked or old soul ready
for the bus arriving when it came 

A blistering unawareness of where I had to be 
The sleeping sand, with crusted eyes I saw it!
collapsing down through the hourglass of the sea 
Every little life we’d never lead 
Paths of still drunk, Sunken footprints 
Forbidden from our view
Raised and filled, erased by rippling pillars of salt  -All of it  -
behind us now
And all my lessons forgotten so conveniently 
Believing in flutters of stolen moments 
That my wings were still attached to me 

What’s in a name? 
That bitterness we call a Rose 
By any other name might make
A call to arms as balming ribs upon my cage 
Endebted to the very 
marrow of you 
And for Our names which are no part of me
Take all my endless death 
And breathe the life I thought I’d left 
Blowing all the sky back into it 

And then,
And Yet,
the scathing mirror scrapes my jaw 
On yours 
a spark
A sharpened, surfacing flattery  
Too bright to look upon 
Immolating and prostrating
In the filthiest of flames 
of fetid fucking faggotry 

The winter is a window 
The widow that I swear I was 
And the frost 
It splinters round a broken Word
~It holds together my eyelashes 
And grips tirelessly at the feathers 

Looking at you to tell myself
That - I could be 
(a dove again)
To look at you is something like 
A Dove 
Or coming home 

And everywhere is doves again 
Suspension flies us over fields and then
leather padded seats absorb my shaking and 
The rear end hyperventilation again 

Your perimeter a masterpiece 
Impasto stroke to stroke 
A falling leaf of all the faces 
And permanently straining traces 
Of unholy human residue 
left bereft and right behind 
And there 
a thousand layers low 
Your x-ray finds a smile 

Wiping vibrant rubies of red wine bile 
from your chin 
was a loveliness 
My black fingernail a corruption 
On such forgotten smoothness of the skin 
Kneeling, from a new perspective 
Lilith, taking sacrament on the landing 
While through an open door our friends 
Dreamt their dreams and held each other 
Then later, cruel warmth of sunshine 
Unveiling secrets I wasn’t ready to tell 
that perfumed stench of sulphur from the ocean
My cratered skin
(Orbited over during sleepless night)
Was the surface of the moon
The novel self I was faced with
Still holding remnants of last night’s 
And your sharp bright mirror face 
Was waking up the sun 
Encasing two round skies 
For feathered ivory in flight 
Where after all the try and try again 
I maybe never had to lie again 
A pair of skies and a why and a when 
To hold: winged immunogen

A deeper sky of now and then
Where I might have been a dove again
