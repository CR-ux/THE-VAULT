Pendulum left in sight 
No time no weight no right 
cross threaded, screw turned tight 
Embedded in my mind 

endless relentless life 
Unenviable fight 
No strength left but I might 
Just dream of sleep tonight 

My brother got the sky 
But I received the night 
My sister, hear a cry 
For every beaten bride 
And hail the vengeful tide 
Upon your rapist swine
Stay quiet otherwise 
And bide yourself some time 
Bereft and left inside 
Potassium chloride 
At least I can say I tried 
To make this place feel mine
My father’s burning pride 
Dissolved the tears I cried 
Living fear crystallised 
Diseased nucleotide  
My love is terrified 
Left in the underside 



A thankless job no one wants to do 
When your turn’s done I’ll come for you 
The endless seasons all renew 
Indifferent to
