On the edge of my bed I dry my hair
You cannot say that I instigated the pain of my pathology gums smoke in the air 

Impulses fire am I a liar or am I crier denier insider outsider controlled or admired as I work and retire my self to my seat 
My condition cognition ambition is wishing to never had had all those wishes to die 
But what good is hoping lonely eloping or quitting the dope if it's agony only that bridgesâ€”- the sighs 
I 
Am bored of life 
I 
Am borderline 
Inspired 
alright 
I'm tired at night 
For the first time in my life 
I try 
To keep my mind 
Occupied
For fear it might 
Conspire 
And wind up killing me 

The doctors have all played hot tattie with my file while I smiled and gave them my history repeatedly 
I am bored of my 
Borderline 
Suicidality 
I am trying to find 
Some piece of mind 
Of a whole that's not holy and doesn't take pieces from skin and rotten teeth 
Camus' 
Absurdity's 
Not lost on me 
is not lost on me

I'll keep rolling these cigarettes 
Rolling right out of debt 
Rolling back down into cancer valley 

I'll keep my appetite whet 
At the very very best I'll get 
Some reflection, direction 
perfection of seeing your face framed by the toilet seat 

And it doesn't matter f they can't see what I see 
Because I'm a fish that is swimming upstream 
And it doesn't make sense except for in my head the time when I'm sleeping is least like a dream 
and the time when I'm outside nightmarishly unreal 

I 
Am bored of my  
Interest free aloan time 
I 
Am borderline 
Inside of my 
Own reality
