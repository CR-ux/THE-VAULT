Ten worlds 
Ten tracks 
Sonic representation of consciousness 
Transcending thought 
Transcending life experience 
Rising 


KATABASIS was pushed out, forcefully, from a place of incredible pain, resistance and suffering. 
ANABASIS will emerge, gently, organically, from a place of stillness and acceptance. 
Both releases - a period of meditation and reading of scripture 
KATABASIS - gnostic mythology and Christianity 
ANABASIS - eastern mysticism and Buddhism 

Both halves equally important 
It is an interplay, a dance. 
The polarity of all existence. 
KATABASIS is ego 
ANABASIS is selfhood 
So called Ugliness is in breath 
Contraction
Destructive impulse 
Beauty is out breath
Relaxation
Creative impulse

Nam myoho renge Kyo 

The latter day of the dharma 

KATABASIS pointed towards the Hell of the human body. 

The human body is a vehicle That may be used to cross the river of misery 

Once the body is disintegrated, we return to the Allness, no longer subject to the suffering of Polarity 
But it is this Polarity that enables an acceleration of consciousness on both the individual and therefore the collective level. 

We are being given the tools to drive consciousness across the river 

And we may choose to cross, or let ourselves drown 

I, the planing of my planks
Atop this river I may cross 
I the choice to build my raft 
From the bones of what I’ve lost 

I the laying of my debts 
At waters edge 


You’ve loved me and you have held me 
The roots contained in every seed 
You’ve been telling me of heaven 
By bringing my own hell to me 

And all the petals 
Falling in my garden 
I crushed them all 
Into a dust 
I 

Nobody ever hurt me 
I only ever hurt myself
