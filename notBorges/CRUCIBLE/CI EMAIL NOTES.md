- So grateful for how this has worked out
	- Did ask for additional outside dev help to begin with, but very glad CI pushed me not to as now I’ve gained significant dev competency and largely credit CI to obtaining this job with Accenture 
	- This then helped me realise the cracks in my original JS/CSS/HTML schema —> react 
- Not exactly Greenfield but insecure out how little output due to:
	- Reimagining the product to React at late stage
	- Untreated ADHD / unforeseen personal issues and self doubt
