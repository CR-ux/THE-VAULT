TENDRITE is the first interactive visual album, which takes a ‘choose-your-own-song’ approach, integrated into a web app. The project changes the way we listen to and purchase music, disrupting the currently exploitative payment practices of streaming platforms for artists, and challenging the single-track modality of music appreciation for fans.
