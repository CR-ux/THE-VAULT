permalink: Eye test notes

Lots of eye floaters
Occasional white flashing pinpoint dots 
Occasional flashing blue dot (always in the same area of vision) 
Feeling of pressure behind the eyes 
Can see the pulse of the blood vessels in my eye 
Blurriness (comes and goes) on top of my normally myopic vision 
Blue field entoptic phenomenon
