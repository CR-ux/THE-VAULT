I have learned 
In a stitch-picked patch of sky 
To love myself 
One moment at a time 
Moments laying on top of one another 
Like naked bodies 
Offering warmth 
As sacrament 

I have learned 
In a stolen loaf of bread 
To be with myself 
One slice at a time 
Holding the wheat to my nose 
To breathe in the harvest 
And know what I have reaped 

I am learning 
In a shattered locket 
Consigned to never being opened again 
In its broken hinge 
And the brute force that broke it 
That I am more than this 
Than the visage of a silk scarf 
Taking flight in a breeze
And leaving such vital blood 
vessels 
behind 

I will learn 
Again 
In a bed 
In a room 
In a house made of willow 
To remember who I am 
And the fruit the seed came from 
And the leaves rotting 
Into everything I never was 

I will learn this 
All of it 
From ancient tomes 
And the briefest note 
Penned in a single breath
