holding hands at that kitchen table, NYE, saying:
‘this is our church’
feeling in communion for the 1st time in my life
now there will never be anyone else to talk with about or see the God in everything like you could 
show me the God in my transness, the joy of presence contained in my deepest fears & doubts, the deliciously secret wisdom underneath every word image & sensation-
you’d be overjoyed for my surgeries & you’d write something so much better than this if I was the one who was gone & in lieu of being able to open my mouth to sing for you I wish my writing could do the dazzling shimmering light of your precious soul even a modicum of justice. while no Body has occupied the space beside me each night since surgery & I have not seen or kissed your face in a year I have not spent one moment of this darkness alone because I know that every single thing I experience is held in the softness of you, in everything
but, if you were here in corporeal form, you’d make me laugh so much that it would hurt in the best way, not like this. a phantom agony, a dry socket-
I wish this didn’t hurt so much & I fking miss my friend I had no idea an emotion could be so physical & yet so easily break through the strongest painkillers as if they were tictacs I love you always Adrian you taught & continue to teach me so much & all my striving & staying here & being alive & leaning forward against the howling wind to try, try to move 1 step at a time this last year is because of your memory & the love of you & the knowing in the unknowing of the place & Now that you are 
would that I could visit your resting place today 
but this world is Our Church 
you are: everywhere.
I am: honouring you in every thing I do; kissing you on every dancefloor. you are: the healing of my wounds; the dissolving of my stitches.
I keep the love of you in my body to remind me this body is worthy of love. You taught me: these bodies are Our Church; ‘this healing is eternal and all-encompassing’. you lived your life (so few of us can say that) to pass it on. you heal the earth. draw down the moon effortlessly. illuminating The Way in the loneliness of night time. when faith in footpath’s steadiness is dwindling -you heal the earth. with the divine, giddy HOPE you emanated.
you heal the earth by having graced it with you. 
Now our job is to continue. attempt to pastiche the Earth’s Magnum Opus: Adrian’s Love. 

Adrian is Love. 
Adrian was, and always will be, Love.
