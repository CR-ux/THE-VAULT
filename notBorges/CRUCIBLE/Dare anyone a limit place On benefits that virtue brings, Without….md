No Ganges, and no Yamuná No Sarabhú, Sarassathì, Or flowing Aciravatì, Or noble River of Mahì, 
Is able to wash out the stain In things that breathe here in the world; For only virtue’s water can Wash out the stain in living things. 
No breezes that come bringing rain, No balm of yellow sandalwood, No necklaces beside, or gems Or soft effulgence of moonbeams, Can here avail to calm and soothe Men’s fevers in this world; whereas This noble, this supremely cool, Well-guarded virtue quells the flame. 
Where is there to be found the scent That can with virtue’s scent compare, And that is borne against the wind As easily as with it? Where 
Can such another stair be found That climbs, as virtue does, to heaven? Or yet another door that gives Onto the City of Nibbána? 
Shine as they may, there are no kings Adorned with jewellery and pearls That shine as does a man restrained Adorned with virtue’s ornament. Virtue entirely does away 
With dread of self-blame and the like; Their virtue to the virtuous Gives gladness always by its fame. 
From this brief sketch it may be known How virtue brings reward, and how This root of all good qualities Robs of its power every fault.
