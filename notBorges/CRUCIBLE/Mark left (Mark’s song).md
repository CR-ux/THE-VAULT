in the hood 


when i entered the room 

i entered the room 

in the hood 
i did the work i should 


and when they finally met me 
i thought they would never respect me 
but they heard the words 
i was saying

i stood my ground and felt my hurt 
i walked around free in my skirt 
i had found
A way in 

i entered the room 
pretty sure i’d be leaving soon 

but i’m here for now 
I owe my Self the world somehow


But Adam 
—-
we danced for one night 
under the tree 
our love was contained 
within the fruit’s seed 
hi stood my foot against his neck 
as i siphoned his orgasm 
he chased men yet ll i had left 
to say was just 
“but, adam”
i hold onto the beauty of my love letter 
i hold onto the fact that i sent it 
it’s all i can do to hold onto the breath of you 



Back home from nursery put the teletubbies on 
Now I think that TINKY WINKY was the OG non
Binary champion with their sickening expression 
Femme queen realness goes to teach us children a lesson 
That gender is a lie we tell each other and ourselves 
For some of us it becomes the inner circle of hell 
But TINKY WINKY told me before I could even tell 
My gender iden-titties hadn’t grown yet quite so well 

Then I realised I wasn’t a lass or a lad 
They didn’t understand at school and just called me a fag 
Back in the nineties representation was so bad 
Tinky Winky was the only role model I had 

I went full Tinky Winky with the full handbag 
Going full Tinky Winky girl yeah that’s where it’s at 
Cool Tinky Winky what you got in your handbag 
Probably a lipstick and a gigantic pride flag 

Growing up in pain was the only way I knew how 
Then I learned to love myself and bitch look at me now 
Fuck how you’ve been told to dress everything is allowed 
Celebrate yourself with both a courtesy and a bow 

And go... 
FULL TINKY WINKY...
tiny winky oh tinky winky
what you got in your handbag 
tinky winky oh tinky winky 
i grew out of you and then grew back
tinky winky oh Tinky Winky 
you sashayed along the right track 
Tinky Winky yes queen Tinky Winky 
you’re made up of what the world lacks




it’s time to make a joke of this
like you made a joke out of me
never respecting, always rejecting 
my entire identity 
i think it’s time to make a joke of this 
like i made a joke out of us 
we were always losing, i was always choosing 
power over trust 
i think it’s time to make a joke of this 
it’s been a whole year nearly 
although i loved the smell of your pits 
and i loved your dick so dearly 

i refuse to be the butt of this one 
as much as you and my butt had fun 
i don’t deserve to be abused 
you got some transphobic bullshit to work through 

i won’t carry round this load of guilt no more
aT THe TIME it was safer to lie 

i don’t care how good your dick was 
you also 
made me 
wanna die 

and to his brand new partner 
you’re welcome for his education 
four years looking over my shoulder excuse on excuse for your fucking abuse 
your gestation 
my frustration

 
i don’t care how good your dick was 
you also 
made me 
wanna die
