Expected response is 204 in othercodes.json 
Only managed to get 400 response so far
Running trial and error on record_id, tried adding a line into the payload with the friendly name and the relevant record_id I found in the SVC file of the Application repo which apparently is BB50105

Quite convoluted so reached out to devs and Sam is currently helping elucidate how the required fields and the record_id match up (the getCode wasn’t very helpful as it says that no friendly names exist for the fields)

- [ ] BF51215
- [ ] Reached out to Sam for help who told me the required fields are provided in the code and I didn’t need to populate them anyway bc they’re put in a BTR 
- [ ] So ticket Blocked by 837 which was erroneously marked as done which I raised in the sprint review 
- [ ] Huge Pride call afternoon (lots of events coming up October with new starts) 
- [ ] New tickets from Anya 
- [ ] Any resolution from the SSLmutual file being deleted from repo? Is it safe to pull now
