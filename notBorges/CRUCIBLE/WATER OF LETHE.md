Mention ALL the rivers, not just lethe 

- ACHERON
- LETHE
- COCYTUS
- PHLEGMETHON 
- STYX

DRINK FROM THE RIVER FORGET WHAT’S BEEN DONE
BE READY TO PART WITH THE COIN ON YOUR TONGUE 
DRINK FROM THE RIVER FORGET HOW TO SING
THERE STANDS THE ELM FROM WHICH ALL YOUR FALSE DREAMS CLING

TO THE FROZEN NORTH I SWAM MY UNCHARTED PATH
I GIVE NOT WAY BEFORE EVIL ON THESE WET SHORES
I AM THE FLESH OF HIS UNENDING WRATH
NO HARDSHIP COMES TO ME FRESH OR UNLOOKED FOR

I BEG WITH MY ARMS ROUND THE LEFT LEG OF HADES 
(And pray for the day that his brother might save me 
At home with the lonesome and aborted babies
Open the sacred portals of 
THE WAY THAT LEADS DOWN 
The path TO THE BIRDLESS MIRROR OF AVERNUS
IS AN EASY ONE TO TREAD
BUT EMERGING IN THE UPPER AIR 
A TERRIBLE AND WEARISOME THREAD 
MY MOTHER SENT ME TWO YOUNG DOVES 
TO FIND THE GOLDEN BOUGH 
CATCHING BLOOD FROM THROATS IN BOWLS 
AND PUSHING ALL MY FLOWERS DOWN 

FEAR AND HUNGER AND SHAMEFUL WANT 
SHAPES DREADFUL TO LOOK UPON 
DEATH, DISTRESS, SLEEP DEATH’S COUSIN
AND THE CELL OF FURIES CAST IN IRON
FOUL IS THE CLOAK THAT HANGS BY A KNOT 
FROM THE FILTHY SHOULDERS OF CHARON

[screamed at end]  
THE COLD OF THE SEASON COMPELS THEE 
YOU THE NAKED AND UNBURIED 
I OFFERED UP A GOLDEN LEAF 
TRANSFORMED TO CURRENCY IN GRIEF 
AND OPENED UP MY MOUTH TO HIM 
AND DRANK THE WATER OF HIS SIN
