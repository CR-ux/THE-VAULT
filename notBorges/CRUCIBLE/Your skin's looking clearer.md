<span style="color:#000ff;">Your skin's looking clearer!</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">How can it always look clearer</span>  
<span style="color:#000ff;">And still be scarred and polka dotted</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Have you ever met someone</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">You'd throw it all away for</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Don't throw me away</span> 




<span style="color:#000ff;">This life of mine</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Is just a moment in time</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">And some things will never be mine</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">But I don't mind</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">I look inside of myself</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Put different parts up on different shelves</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">And the parts that I've been given</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">We died inside of a suitcase</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Waiting to be released</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">You were sad we didn't make it</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">I could only feel relief</span> 


<span style="color:#000ff;">i promise you</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">i didn't do</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">anything</span>
