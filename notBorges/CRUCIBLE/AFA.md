Rent payment for ex partner of toxic relationship 
breakup of said relationship left me with entire rent to cover along with the overdraft payment which i am trying to pay back alone (paid in £200 this month) 
I have been trying to get by on money borrowed from my dad, (over a thousand) who will expect the money back at some point… This is all impacting my mental health enormously; m condition is already disabling which is why i have special circumstances for my mental health condition on my student profile. I have taken 4 months interruption from my PhD because of my mental health, which I have to say has been massively impacted by the financial and the emotional aftermath of my abusive relationship. 
I have attached the proof of payment of three months of my ex partners rent in 2016; in the form of the email I sent to the letting company. You can see from this email that even back then I was supporting Yordan and was under a lot of stress because of it. This has worsened. 

TALK

i started small 
i thought that was the answer, to get the bigger picture, we have to go inward 
and for the most part, up until a certain point, this is true. As scientists we scan the environment with our senses, perhaps aided by the collective manmade sense of technology, for empirical data. And it worked really well for us for centuries; some of the worlds greatest problems being solved by simply breaking the whole into its constituent parts. 

But then the double slit experiment came along, and for me, learning about it in A level physics was like being shaken violently by some unknown force, like the chains keeping me bound to the walls of the cave were being rattled by someone Else telling me that the shadows were just a reflection of what was really going on. The act of observation collapses the wave function. 

So, underneath it all, is something that we almost don’t have *permission* to see, and that almost scared me. All these years i was about to dedicate to the art of science, would only scratch the surface of the Truest nature of reality. 

But then I thought back to Lovelace, to Franklin, to Curie, and how those phenomenal minds were also trapped in a previous iteration of the same kafka-esque problem I found myself in. But I had the gift of hindsight. The nature of reality, regardless of its absolute state, has evolved, been chipped away at, and the discoveries built upon, sometimes transmuted, sometimes disregarded as the paradigm shifts, but all information contributes to the whole. 

That’s why I think in genetics, it is very important that we don’t get overly attached to this DNA:Gene:Protein:function paradigm that was drilled into my brain again and again throughout school. The more we learn about genetics, the more we utilise the collective knowledge of technology in modelling genetic processes, the more we see each individual drop becoming an ocean, and the gene networks evidently more intricately wound than we could ever imagine with our current state of consciousness. 

I want to stress, however, how excited I was by my results in my GWAS. My Mind, which has always dominated by being, shouted out at me immediately, screaming how amazing this significant peak was around the region of RIPK2. 
In truth, when I really calm my mind and reflect on the discovery, I think, as with all science, it was a question of right place and right time. Of course it couldn’t have existed without the diligence and skill of the scientists at Hyline who collected the data, the collaborators in Iowa and my supervisors, but all of these things had to click into place in a perfect harmony, just like everybody woke up this morning and ended up here sat in front of me. From a data perspective, we were incredibly lucky, although I sort of don’t like the term, that this natural infection occurred and it was of such gratitude. Of course, the same luck cannot be ascribed to the chickens. 

When I really delve deep into the data and comparatively analyse the groups, I find that common elements, while definitely there, are entrenched within deeper and deeper layers of regulation. We cannot expect to find genetic aetiology of any disease or health state, without first having a workable paradigm that incorporates the entire genome in all its layers of functionality. 
I see the results here as a strong signpost, like I see any discovery in genetics. Genes are our particles, in that they function as regulatory waves. It is our observation of the effects of genetic regulation that collapses the wave function into a particle of an idea workable by our current human brains. 
RIPK2 is a good sign, it’s a sign that we’re going somewhere. Just like ANP32, it’s a great anchor point for future work. 

It’s about how you look at things.
We could despair at our sisyphean fight for Truth, constantly pushing the paradigm boulder up the hill to watch it fall back down again, or we can simply walk around it, and see the boulder from a higher vantage point. 
Nothing will ever be the complete truth, tragically, but sometimes a really bad thing happens and from that, the Truest type of knowledge is gained. I think that’s what’s happened in 2013 and 2015, and I hope to carry this work on, through the in silico, in vitro, in ovo, to in vivo studies that will complete this chapter of the bigger story of avian influenza resistance.
