Lyrics will be anchor point for progression through pieces
Grids will be drawn for each song with each part’s rough description 

All my flowers 
Church bells samples & solo violin to start
Glissandos for all instruments over an octave, more instruments coming in as piece progresses 
“They rise” is the cue for brass, and then descending piano motif could cue for quieting of other instruemnts  
3:30 - “I pushed all my flowers” all instruments in harmony/ melody with lyrics , cue with headbang
Rhythmic ending , drums come in 
Syncopated octave glissandos on all instruments 
No resolve lead into next track 


Triggered sample of Leviticus alerts everyone to next track 
25s: Just strings for ‘under every leaf’
Drink from the river - brass come in, drone on strings 
Piano melody at 2:38 is cue for second Leviticus sample 
5:48 - crop point 
- Strings doing Beethoven LH esque things
- Piano updown up down 
- Drums light cymbals/rim 

Verily I build such frail houses - three voice harmony 
2nd line - strings come in 

Brass harmonising with vocals at heavenly dreams 

Brass gets extra 
BVs singing last two lines 
Distortion mic for names 
Cymbal swell sustained 
Monika cues rainstorm sample 

Vocals and piano first section 

O this disgusting truth - on truth 
Pulses of chords with last lyric of each line 
Tissue to dry your mouth - cue for drums 

Strings melody while brass pulses 

Wind sample track 4 
Call and response of vocal melody after second verse 
‘Parts left behind’ is cue 


Dries is cue for cymbals and drums 
Chromatic piano is solo 

Descent section conducted 

Come up with symbols for each of the motifs 
Mon - organ 
I descended a third a time = drums cues 
End of their time I entered the prison = drums cue to go crazy 

End of track 4 - harmonic on cello solo, silence for one minute 
Eating pomegranate 



Centre of my greatest shame needs visual cue for start of rhythmic section
