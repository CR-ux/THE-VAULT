Paying everyone 
Studio hire 
Stage piano 
Costuming 


with the KATABASIS grant, i really tailored it as a self-publishing thing which i only really came to terms with once that record store labelled it as such, that's why i was so resistant to it bc it shone light on how i've been doing things so wrong! i should have just spent so much more on recording, reached out to the relevant people who are actually trained and paid for admin, eventually to get it pressed one day, not be my own fucking secretary/promoter, and not have 300 records in my own darn house! it all starts with how you perceive yourself and your practice, and i should not be wasting my time or this opportunity for such inflow of cash on things that are not at all related to the practice..


Get a super SUPER tight EPK together. 
Pay everyone fairly for the recording / rehearsal time. 
Only need ONE show. Only need ONE live show. 
Think BCNR’s latest live release. 
Get a super fucking nice looking venue to host, a church - perhaps st Vincent’s in Edinburgh. 
Once a very professional online presence/record of the show has been made; THEN reach out to promoters. Get THEM to do the work they are trained for and paid to do. 



St Vincent’s Edinburgh - venue hire 
Rehearsal AND performance fees for everyone 
Only one drummer (Andy)
Costumes?
Film crew in kind hopefully - lea
