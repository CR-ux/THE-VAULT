Track 1 - EARTH
Start in hole in wall - closed movements, 
light behind and fabric in front to create soft edged silhouette 
Fabric drops with piano 
Rotational rumination stirring energy 
Contorted movement to seated position on ledge for beginning of Vox 
Remain seated in hole for duration of first track 

Anchor points to get to ledge 
Contact points lost as the transition 
Looking at contact point
**CHEW ROSES AND SPIT ONE BY ONE ONTO FLOOR**


Track 2 - WATER
Flowing in spiral shape through crowd 
Touching shoulders and showing contact with eyeline 
Finish in centre for track 3 

DRINK FROM THE RIVER FORGET - HOLD UP VESSEL AND PLACE ON WINDOW/ALTAR - REACH UP TOWARDS IT
**POUR GLYCERIN OVER HEAD - at ‘SO DRINK’**

Track 3 - FIRE
Centre 
Starting low finishing high
Flicker to flow - introduction of jolting movement (more natural, not so contorted) 
Bent knee as base, flames travel up through whole spine into head and fingers
In coda - movements becoming more jolted (intermittent flickers) 
Contraction becoming less each time as movement expand - progression into a higher more opened space 
Gradually growing stillness in the final moments
Ending with arm outstretched moving onto the heart  

- Soundscape set for lengthened air samples 


Track 4 - AIR
Starting with tenderness, exploring the self with softness 
Into grasping, snatching, being taken from - at transition movement losing flow 
Hands upward, fingers outstretched, open, asking 
Manic energy 
Lying on floor before convulsion

Track 5 - ETHER
Thrown from fetal to supine - elbow torque to throw onto back 
Convulsion spasming in transition - oppressive nature of religion/devotional music contrast 
Arching back for allusion to sexuality 

Shackles that he tackles WITH - hand comes away from floor 

I DEVOUR THE AFFLICTED (bridge) - slow headbang - end of each line (x4 bars) look around in passing glances 

Transition - puppet strings/spiderweb coming from heart centre/collarbones to open up form, dancing around fire 


Track 6 - LIGHT

- &nbsp;
	- Blinding overpowering light - feeling of being exposed (AV) spotlight/flodlight on floor or in front of projector 
- Sense of resistance to the light/photosensitivity 
- Shielding of the eyes 
- Stepping heel to beat 
- Respite - grasping to soft touch, externalise energy, reversal of track 4 
- Contortion 
- Bridge - collapses down at end (crocodile mouth) 
- Quiet verily I Build such frail…
- “Houses” - coming out of internal space, looking around
- circular confrontation with inner circle at trumpets going into final chorus 
- Slow build of chorus - don’t succumb to the metal !!!!!!!!!
- FINAL BVs are the anchor point for metal 


Track 7 - THOUGHT - don’t upstage the piece with over performance 
- Opening point - hand on heart 
- Invite them in - looking into crowd 
- Conversation 
- Strings of violins.. travelling back to window 
*don’t plan movement - keep stillness as an anchor 

- Up sitting on ledge for final I DEVOUR MY LOVE ANDWONDER WHERE IT[S GONE 
- “Gone” - tactile moment (scraping) 
- Spoken word - climbing back in (exit) - keep it simple 
	- Rollerblind - lights go down, absent for applause
