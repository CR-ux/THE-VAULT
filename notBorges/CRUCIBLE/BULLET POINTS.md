for budget additional info, I need to add income sources. My budget states there is £7,280 of match funding. With a total of £44,997 requested from unlimited and an actual cost of £52,277, this makes for approx 14% match funding (4% above the 10% required amount). these sources are as follows:
CONFIRMED INCOME:
£3000 match funding from DiD fund (help musicians UK) to press album to vinyl / duplicate cassette run
Pledges from my patreon community, currently at £60/month (most likely increasing over the course of the project) - leading to minimum confirmed income of £960 over the 16 months of the project (June 2024 - October 2025) 

ESTIMATED INCOME:
TIX (£15 x 150 = £2,250). 
VINYL(£25 x 15 = £375).
ACCESS TO WORK GRANT = £695
