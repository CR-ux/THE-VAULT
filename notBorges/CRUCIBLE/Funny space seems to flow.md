<span style="color:#000ff;">Funny space seems to flow</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Between us all at the speed of sound</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">Money makes the world go</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">The wrong way round</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">Sat on a train to go to Oxford</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Next to a man from Azerbaijan</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Who seemed to know tiredness</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">In my legs from not being able to stand the time alone</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">Used to see people as judges</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Gavel travel down</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">But I see now</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">I had it the wrong way round</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">I wear my socks inside out</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">Turned my t shirt inside out</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">My skin's turned inside out</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">My insides have nearly fallen out</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Cus I had it</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">By Force of habit</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">The wrong way round</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">i know that in 5 minutes i’ll regret this song</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">and in another 5 minutes i will be singing along</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">with myself in my head as i right my wrongs</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">of self hatred and a sob story that’s way too long</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">yeah it takes some time</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">eventually you find</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">little moments in the day that keep you feeling alive</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">you have to thank the universe for all the little things</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">because one day a big thing comes along and clips your wings</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">Trees are dancing from high winds</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">To songs in my ear</span>
