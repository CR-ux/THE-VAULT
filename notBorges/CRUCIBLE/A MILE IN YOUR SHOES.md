permalink: A MILE IN YOUR SHOES
---
Performance piece about structural transphobia of shoe sizes 
Pain, blood, damaging performance 
Trying on shoes too small? Walking in shoes too small? Filling shoes with blood? 


Research mythology around feet 








PERFORMANCE COMPONENT:
A pair of high heels in the largest size found on the high street (10? 9?) 

Shove feet into them (should there be blood packs inside to ensure bloody feet?) 
Walk a mile in square around the space, stumbling, screaming 
Take shoes off and leave footprints on white floor to leave the space 

Washing feet to occur before or after walk?

SOUND COMPONENT:
Piezo mics inside heels? What would this achieve besides ambient noise?
Needs to ADD something
