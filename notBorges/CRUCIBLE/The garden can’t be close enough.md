The garden can’t be close enough
to a whittled little human heart
the forking paths of who we are 
Burst out like stretching seams 
A riverbed is finite and the water is a lifetime 
Eternity collapsing in on dreams
Farewelling waves and forgotten kisses 
interfere in mattered patterns
Kaleidoscopic lattices of consciousness 
A net of strings and unknown No-Things 
(And only that which is well hidden 
Can ever be wise to what this means)

Everything hangs from cumbersome chains 
Pinching finger flesh between them
Themselves strung on fishing wires 
Rulers caught ruling, 
hunter led hunting 
In some great celestial game 
Barely able to be seen 
Seeing in the subject 
The seeing of the eye
The fleeting fight  
The unlit light of the flame

I am an infinity to be contained 
We are a child to be held 

The I that I am is holding mind  
As she weeps 

Stay on the narrowest path 
Walking on a knife edge 
Suspended by hooks through the skin that connect to fishing wire 
Invisible 
Indisputable 

The more here you are the more you disappear 
The more you can detach yourself the more the self appears
