<span style="color:#000ff;">You've been there</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Since when you used to have hair</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">I know there are useful morals you embedded</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">But god help me if that's where my hairline is headed</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">It would be absurd</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">If after twenty years on this planet</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">The only thing I could write about you is that you're balding and you've basically had it</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">But this is my speech</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">I know it doesn't follow convention</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">But weirdness runs in the family</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Well that and hypertension</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">I know I don't like football</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">As much as you do</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">But I went to all of those games</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Just to sit next to you</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">So let's all sing together</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Way up sky blues</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">While we sing together</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">We will never lose</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">Here comes the bride</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Right by your side</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Injecting your life</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">With sunshine and smiles</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">I love her for loving you and I know that she loves us too</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Loving her is easy</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">She's a key that Setsyour spirit free</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">So fitting and unique</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Not copyable by a machine</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">I hope at sixty</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">I'm as happy</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">As you and maggie</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">And everyone can see</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Your hearts magnetic field</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Pulling so strongly</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">And I'm holding so tightly</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">To the hope you've given me</span> 
 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Heroes come in all shapes and sizes</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">What you've done for me hasn't gone unnoticed</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Next to eachother is where you belong</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">You gave me a reason to write a happy song</span>  


<span style="color:#000ff;">I remember getting one on the way</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Play nine holes with you and drive my troubles away</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Now I'm all grown up I can reliably say</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">Things are really okay and you made them that way</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">While I'm your best man today you've been my best man always</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">I'm your best man today but dad you're mine every day</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">Heroes come in all shapes and sizes</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">I'm riding on the left side while mine is driving</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">As you embark upon your own journey</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">The lights see you coming and they all turn green</span>
