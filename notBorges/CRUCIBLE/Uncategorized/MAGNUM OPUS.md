SHAON I RISE

 I MEET THE FOUR

 I AM THE CENTRE


 FROM WHICH THE ALLNESS SPIRALS

 INVOKING ONLY TRUTH


 IN LIGHT I RISE 


 IN LOVE I REST

 I RISE I ARISE WITH MY KNIVES I RISE I ARISE WITH THE FIVE I RISE I ARISE NOW ALIVE


**TAPESTRY / ALTAR CLOTH**: to capture offerings **CAULDRON**: to burn offerings **SHELL**: to wash away **CENSER**: to ignite **CANDLES**: to illuminate the four directions **LAMP**: bringer of Lux **OBSIDIAN**: to ground **BELL**: to resonate **ROD**: (vertical aspect of cross neath cauldron) the will to be whittled **STAFF**: (horizontal aspect of cross neath cauldron) the warrant to be whittled **SEALS**: seven dried rose petals placed at the 6 vertices and the 1 centre
**ALTAR**: hexagonal vehicular structure of two levels




- **North**: bell, air, iris
- **South**: earth, obsidian, baphomet
- **West**: water, abalone shell, persephone
- **East**: fire, censer & incense, thoth/hermes trismegistus



Widdershins & Deosil about the hexagon with smudge
 Pentagram in each direction with the bell
 Pinch of water inside abalone to the four corner knots of Atet 
(Nimbus, Lux, Mycelium, Humus)
 Stand legs apart above the centre and clutch obsidian to the heart 

and then 

to whittle, allowing all thoughts to come and be laser-focused effortlessly into each sacred shedding of the wood.
 To open at the hips, at the heart, at the spine and embrace the altar with the legs.
 To capture all shed offerings in the altar cloth underneath.
 To bundle all the thoughts, intentions, feelings and selves together and place lovingly into the cauldron to be burned.
 Ignite whatever must be transformed focus entirely on its immolation 

knowing and holding the cauldron as portal to this universe 

as looking in through a skylight of the entirety of creation 

iterating down and down

 and up and on

 and on and now 

and now 

and now

 And 

then to crush the ash with obsidian 

to seal with seven burned rose petals

 to pour in water from abalone 

to stir 

to place the lid upon the cauldron 

to blow out the blessed candle.
