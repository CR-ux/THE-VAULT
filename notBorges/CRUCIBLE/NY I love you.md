NY I love you 
But you’re bringing me down
The lights went out 
i dreamt about my ex
woke up with this melody in my head
and i wish i could kiss better all of the us regret 
burn and eschew grief with gratitude 
turn a new leaf to rectitude 
and the will will distill to instil love’s great magnitude 
inside my waking hours 
still dreaming of what was ours
and outside my quaking house 
time to become the flowers 
an ovum is an exit 
a heart a creaking gate 
opened on a closing pulse 
formidably too late 

Barnie I love you 
But I’m weighing you down 





Callie I loved you 
But I just cannot now 

Callie I loved you 
But you’re screaming too loud 

Callie I loved you 
But what’s lost can’t be found 

Callie I fucked you 
But it’s just clustered now 

Callie I loved you 
Or maybe just found 
A new way to drown out 
My own
