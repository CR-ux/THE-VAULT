<span style="color:#000ff;">It's been so long since I've seen you out</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">I said it's been too long since I saw you last</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">Nothing happened</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">It all didn't happen so fast</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">all the things I've ever hoped for</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Have been shrouded in doubt</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">But things will work out well for me</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">Well</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Things will work out</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">You said</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">I'm young and I have my friends</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">I'm young and I have my friends</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">I need glasses but at least I can see</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">What if my friends die</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Then where will I be</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">At a bus stop waiting to become elderly</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">Yeah I took them for about a year</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">And the sex was bad like it's always been</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Like fucking half asleep</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">But if bad sex is the price of feeling alright then I don't mind</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Things will set themselves right</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">Well they might</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">They might</span>
