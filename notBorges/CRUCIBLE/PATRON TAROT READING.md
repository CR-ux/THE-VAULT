permalink: PATRON TAROT READING
---
This is a general reading for my patrons as I am focusing on their collective energies to call upon their guides, but it is also a reading for anybody who may stumble across this video as I do believe these things find who they need to and I do infuse my readings with astrology which applies to us all.

This is a general reading created for my patrons as I focus on their energies, but really it is a video for you, whoever is watching this in the current moment, as tarot readings find you and resonate when and where they need to. 

Tarot is an inherently creative process, and just like any art form it is not exclusively accessible to a few. Mechanistic approaches that rigidly use defined meanings of cards and attempt to predict events are flawed in my opinion, as creativity is based around a flowing conversation between the conscious and the subconscious. The ultimate goal of tarot is to be a mirror - reflect the internal state of the querent and provide suggestions that may illuminate the querentâ€™s own perception of themselves.
