kiss/kill me
i left early
couldn't stand the party
i showed the smallest part of me

i don't ever want to know
how it feels to let you go

so kiss me, kill me
just be happy
kiss me kill me
just be

it should be easy

i wanna touch your bleeding face
and know where you are
i wanna smell you
i wanna see you
in the boot of my car
i want to feel love
can i feel love
i don't know where you are
