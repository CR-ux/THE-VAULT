Are you confuuuuuuused? About Patreon? Don’t worry, it’s confusing: a guide by lonely carp: aka calyx rose petal

I’ve had a lot of artist friends and also listeners ask about how Patreon works so I decided to make this rundown for you (whispered* honestly more for myself to help me get my shit together I am such a chaotic *bleep* I *bleep* swear to god) 

Basically Patreon is a platform that offers exclusive content by artists in exchange for a monthly subscription of your support. (Cutaway of terrible drawing exchangedp with money and cute :3 face - I hate the world today sample?) 
There are usually different tiers, with each tier offering you specific rewards that are also inclusive of the rewards in tiers below. 
and here are mine:
For £3/month - you get access to the song journal, which is basically my transition diary with an original soundtrack of attached raw recordings of work in progress [ON SCREEN: SONG JOURNAL + OST]
For £5/Month - you get an instant free download of my 108-track archival album [ON SCREEN: ARCHIVE DOWNLOAD]
for £10/month - Every month you get an early stream/download of my EHFM radio show CONSTANTLY FAILING, an audio extension of the song journal that contains discussions about noise music, original songs, and  interviews with incredible musicians such as Jamie Stewart from Xiu Xiu, Uboa, and Backxwash.
For £20/month - you get physical merch, which will include t-shirts, tote bags and stickers. I’m not going to explain how this works here but there’s another video explaining it on my YouTube channel [ON SCREEN: MERCH]
And for £30/month - you get a copy of KATABASIS on Vinyl or CD, plus an item of exclusive merch for this release 
The work that I make is highly vulnerable, politically charged and personal. This means that Patreon has been really important for me to feel safe in my practice and still get work out there at the rate that I make it (which is a LOT). As a patron at any tier your name is printed on all physical releases and credited in all videos, and I am so grateful for every single member of my incredible art family
