Dear [patron], dear [patron], dear [patron]…, [harmonised]
Dear diary,

After my business mentoring session that is offered as part of my help musicians grant, I have some exciting housekeeping-y kinda news 
I am now going to be offering merch directly through Patreon! 
The way it works: 
I announce the art that will be used for the merch
The first will be THIS LIMITED EDITION TINKY TOTE 
SO after three consecutive successful pledges the tote bag will be shipped to you, and there will be new merch every 3 months 
According to Patreon’s cost recommendations, I’m introducing a £20 tier for this specifically. 
I’m also removing the £50 and £100 tiers, because, c’mon Calyx *laugh* 
The £30 tier is still here (thank you so much Andrea!!) and you, along with anyone else signed up to this tier will be getting one physical copy of KATABASIS on vinyl or CD when it releases in November, along with one item of exclusive merch for this release.   
Also, I only have about 80 download codes for impatient in patient left, so I’m limiting all the tiers above 5 (5, 10,20,30) to reflect this number until I get more codes from band camp

So now after some streamlining, the tiers are as follows: 
For £3/month - you get access to the song journal, which is basically my transition diary with an original soundtrack of attached raw recordings of work in progress [ON SCREEN: SONG JOURNAL + OST]
For £5/Month - you get an instant free download of my 108-track archival album [ON SCREEN: ARCHIVE DOWNLOAD - LIMITED TO 10]
for £10/month - Every month you get an early stream/download of my EHFM radio show CONSTANTLY FAILING, an audio extension of the song journal that contains discussions about noise music, original songs, and  interviews with incredible musicians such as Jamie Stewart from Xiu Xiu, Uboa, and Backxwash. [on screen: RADIO SHOW - LIMITED TO 20]
For £20/month - you get physical merch, which will include t-shirts, tote bags and stickers. I’m not going to explain how this works here but there’s another video explaining it on my YouTube channel [ON SCREEN: MERCH - LIMITED TO 40]
And for £30/month - you get a copy of KATABASIS on Vinyl or CD, plus an item of exclusive merch for this release [ON SCREEN: KATABASIS VINYL + MERCH]
