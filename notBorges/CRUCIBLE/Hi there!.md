permalink: Hi there!
---
My name is Callie Rose Petal and I make conceptual music as lonely carp. I believe a while back I replied to a callout tweet in which you asked for new Scottish albums, sharing a link for my studio debut ‘KATABASIS: an underworld opera’.
 
 
 
The album is curated as a descent to the underworld, utilising overlapping theologies from various sources, each track corresponding to a chakra of the human body – likening the physical form to Hades itself. 
 
As much as I don’t share this on social media (except for my trusted and tight-knit patreon community) I would like to share with you that this release chronicles my experience of survival sex – an all too common experience amongst trans* women such as myself. The intensity and trauma of this dark year that the album concerns was so great that I had to bury it under intersecting layers of mythology, borrowed from ancient Greek texts, Holy books and my own personally developed archetypes, in order to make such a specific and personal experience relatable to the universal suffering of human experience. Not all of us have known contentedness, not all of us have known light, but every human is au fait with the shadow. With pain; the ultimate sentinel and common thread of consciousness. 
 
The work (supported by the prestigious Do It Differently Fund awarded by Help Musicians UK) is incredibly dark, and draws a lot from metal influence, although I’m not sure if aesthetically this would be the category it fits into. In fact, the ever-present awkwardness with this album and my music in general is that is it quite difficult to place into a genre. 
 
I just wanted to share this with you, vulnerably as ever, because I am ready for this most important work of my life to reach more people, especially as planning for the 2022/3 Edinburgh/Glasgow tour is now well underway, with two Summerhall dates confirmed for July 15<sup>th</sup>/16<sup>th</sup>, and with KATABASIS closing the StagEHd festival in Princes St gardens on May 29<sup>th</sup>. I have developed an extended technique for the tour that uses a 2m long metal chain being whipped against the strings of an electric double bass, the signal being heavily processed through Ableton before it is fed into the PA – introducing an element of chaos into the performance and providing an allusion to both phallic imagery and BDSM culture (pertinent, considering the events that inspired the work).
