life line: 

![[59168477_817961578570078_5780859614857789440_n.jpg]]

Strong arch indicates vitality, a lack of tiring. forking at the end of the life line shows business and statelessness during the middle and late year (calendar or allegorical) 
If you choose to develop your career outside your comfort zone, you can make some great achievements.
A chaining effect at the beginning of the lifeline suggests you were born with a weak digestive system, and i can’t be sure but i think there is an island at around the age you are now, and I don’t want to trigger you but islands indicate hospitals, medical treatment, etc, i think it might be what you went through recently. Especially as this island isn’t reflected in your left hand, the state you were born with.
You have a parallel line to your life line that has a connection, creating a beautiful ‘H’ character. Parallels indicate strong vitality and resistance to disease, so regardless of your weakened digestive system, you are quick to bounce back from immune evasion.
The connection between your vitality and your life seems to be fully realised at about 70 years of age for some reason (this is the connection) so maybe you discover your favourite sport or pastime or spiritual connection in this era of your life(!)

Head line: 
Your head line is essentially a raised arc of your life line, it’s really beautiful similar, they’re like two prongs of these perfectly curved tweezers. Curving of the head line shows gentleness, tolerance, a pragmatic/realistic nature, strong interpersonal skills. You will do well in field such as mass media, PR, literature, social sciences, psychology and law. However, your line becomes very steep suggesting you have a fertile imagination and a high creative ability. You are easily influenced by emotion. Your head and life line are joint at the beginning and split into two equal paths, showing a decisive character with flexibility. You have no overlap, whereas i have a big overlap, which shows  i am indecisive and have  a deeply worried nature

Were you born with poor nutrition at all? I think you have an island on your head line suggesting that 
Your chaining at the beginning of both the head and life line suggests you are a heavy drinker, and this is perhaps what has caused your digestive issues(!!!!!)

Heart line: 
Your heart line ends below where the mount of jupiter joints the mount of saturn (between index and middle finger) 
this indicates purely true love, that you have already experienced at the age of about 20, will be with you for the rest of your life.
You have a strong upward curve meaning great verbal dexterity! When addressing your favourite thing/person/topic, you create a romantic atmosphere and are very expressive indeed. 


you have a heart line trident, showing universal fraternity (you are a great friend) but in love life, you can be cold and unforgiving. 

our heart line shows 3 signs of significant emotional distress when you were very very young, when you were about 5 and when you were about 23 (all ages are approximations) - these are signatures of your ‘shadow self’ this could be a person in your life who was harming you or it could be a manifestation of your own negative energy harming yourself, or a combination of the two.

Your left hand has a strong fate line that connects the heart and head line together. This shows you are not usually stable in your life and career doing youth.After 50 years, you are expected to have a great fortune rom your career but this requires you to continuously work hard instead of retiring (more enjoyable for you anyway right?)

You were not born with your emotional distresses, these were given to you by your environment and external spiritual sources of shadow. This is such a hopeful message as it shows with meditation, right thought, right action, and right intention, your birth given state of passion, stability and childlike wonder can be returned.
