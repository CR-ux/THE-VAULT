<span style="color:#000ff;">you've got shorter hair than me</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">you find it so hard to believe</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">in anything extra ordinary</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">what a sad little life you lead</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">i waved goodbye to you the day you nearly died</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">i said good riddance but i must admit i cried</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">you're probably still in that room somewhere</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">here's your sign that someone out there really cares</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">because you made me who i am</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">your silly poems about a lion wearing skin of lamb</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">the way you cared so much about it all</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">i guess we're not that different i'm just a little more tall</span>


<span style="color:#000ff;">i don't play video games as much as my house mate</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">but it's you it's you it's all for you</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">all the drugs i do</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">i tell you all the time hell is a place on earth but you knew</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">that</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">didn't you</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">you found my voice inside a plastic bag</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">lost sight of everything you ever had</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">woke up on the side of the bathroom sink</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">your blood dripping down the side like it was ink</span>


<span style="color:#000ff;">i still think about you sometimes</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">well no i'm lying cus you're always on my mind</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">i wish i could travel back in time</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">and let you know things are alright</span>
