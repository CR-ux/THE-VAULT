ANOTHER JERK
THIS WRETCHED WORK 
SURELY COULD SAVE A WRETCH LIKE ME 
A SELF TO SHIRK 
THIS WRETCHED WORK 
MIGHT HELP TO SAVE A WRETCH LIKE ME
A MIND BESERK 
THIS WRETCHED WORK 
COULD NEVER SAVE A WRETCH LIKE ME 




While researching references for the album, I knew I wanted to draw from scripture as much as possible. But reading the texts that have provided me with solace, which I have felt the most connected to in my recovery, seemed to not ring true with the themes of the release. I found that the holy texts of abrahamic religions had an oppressive quality, which seemed to encourage a separateness from God. This feeling of isolation from the creator, embedded within the actual semantics of the verses, seemed to emulate the emotional state and life experience that this album is a manifestation of. The darkest work I have ever created, to punctuate and process the darkest time of my life. 

This bondage give thee not a jot of blood 
**And if a woman have an issue (her period/menses), [and] her issue in her flesh be blood, she shall be put apart seven days: and whosoever toucheth her shall be unclean until the even. And every thing that she lieth upon in her separation shall be unclean: every thing also that she sitteth upon shall be unclean. And whosoever toucheth her bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe [himself] in water, and be unclean until the even. And whosoever toucheth any thing that she sat upon shall wash his clothes, and bathe [himself] in water, and be unclean until the even. And if it [be] on [her] bed, or on any thing whereon she sitteth, when he toucheth it, he shall be unclean until the even. And if any man lie with her at all, and her flowers be upon him, he shall be unclean seven days; and all the bed whereon he lieth shall be unclean. And if a woman have an issue of her blood many days out of the time of her separation, or if it run beyond the time of her separation; all the days of the issue of her uncleanness shall be as the days of her separation: she [shall be] unclean. Every bed whereon she lieth all the days of her issue shall be unto her as the bed of her separation: and whatsoever she sitteth upon shall be unclean, as the uncleanness of her separation. And whosoever toucheth those things shall be unclean, and shall wash his clothes, and bathe [himself] in water, and be unclean until the even. But if she be cleansed of her issue, then she shall number to herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean. And on the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtles, or two young pigeons, and bring them unto the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. And the priest shall offer the one [for] a sin offering, and the other [for] a burnt offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for her before the LORD for the issue of her uncleanness."**

PARAGON OF SIN AND ALL THAT IS THEREIN
CURSED BE SHE THAT KEEPS BACK HER SWORD FROM BLOOD

This bondage give thee not a jot of blood 
My waters rise to overflowing flood 

THE VALLEY OF THE LORD WAS FULL OF BONE
A HEART OF FLESH FOR HEART OF STONE
UNDER THEIR WINGS THEY HAD HUMAN HANDS 
ALL OF THEM HAD FACES AND WINGS 
THEY DID NOT TURN AS THEY MOVED 
AN EAGLE LOOKED AT ME 
BEAR THE SIN OF THIS HOUSE 390 DAYS 
AND OPEN THYSELF 

THAT WHICH MAKETH A PROPHET A DEMON 
SPRINGS ANGEL AS BEAST FROM THY BLANK CANVAS
FOR THE OVUM IS AN EXIT AND THE HEART, ITS CREAKING GATE 
OILED UPON BY SPOILS OF THE REPROBATE
DOTH THINE PALATE HOUSE THE ONE TRUE CURRENCY 
MOUTH THE PALACE AND FULL CHALICE OF DIVINITY
DRAW MY SWORD UPON HIS SHEATH
LO! THE ANGELS CRUSHED BENEATH 


CHANT THREE TIMES BEGINNING AND END OF EACH PIECE 
MAKE UP LANGUAGE FOR CHANT 
1. ROOT
2. SACRAL
3. SOLAR
4. HEART
5. THROAT
6. THIRD EYE 
7. CROWN

Iris rode the colours down 
And lay her caduceus in my hand 



An ovum is an exit 
The heart a creaking gate 
They can never fix what;’s yours 
That which you must break 

BREAK WHAT IS 
TO FIX IT 

HOPE WILL KEEP YOU ALIVE 
UNTIL IT KILLS YOU 


THE BLOOD 
THE BLOOD 
THE COMING OF THE FLOOD 
RED WRAPPED AROUND THE WHITE
TIED TO THE BRANCH OF THE ELM TREE 
IN REMEMBRANCE OF THE MAN 
FOR YOU I COULD NEVER BE
DELUGE OF LUBRICANT 
EVER COMING IN THE FLOOD 
HE DID NOT COME BY THE WATER ONLY 
BUT BY WATER AND BY THE BLOOD
FOUR FACES, FOUR WINGS 
HUMAN HANDS ON ALL FOUR SIDES 
WINGS CARESSING ONE ANOTHER 
NEVER TURNING, EVER BURNING
FORWARD, FACING FORWARD 
THERE WERE WHEELS WITHIN THE WHEELS 
SQUEEZING DROPS OF BLEEDING OUT 
WHEN THE LIVING CREATURES WENT 
THE WHEEZING OF MY WHEELS BENT 
THEIR ROD, THEIR STAFF, THEY ENTERED ME 
ANTENNAE SCOPING SACRAMENT 

CALM YOUR WEARY HEART THERE SIR 
UNCLENCH YOUR TIGHTEST COIL 
STOP YOUR WRITHING AND STILL SIR 
SO WE MIGHT SMELL YOUR FOIL 

SIR 
SIR 
YOU CAN’T BE BLEEDING SIR 
SIR 
SIR 
OPEN TO US YOUR TREASURE 
SIR 
SIR 
FRANKINCENSE AND MYRRH
SIR 
SIR
