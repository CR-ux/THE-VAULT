Somehow I was laverne Cox 
Realising I was dreaming 
But not lucid 
And everything my descended into madness, chaos 
Trying to break out of a bathroom window 

Then I was assisting Alan Rickman 
In a performance piece 
Allusion to Christ 
Meltdown on the street 
Meltdown at his feet 
Asking 
Should I wash them
