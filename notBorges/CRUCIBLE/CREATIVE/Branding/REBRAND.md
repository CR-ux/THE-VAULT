permalink: REBRAND
---
for each of these reimagined album covers featuring AZOTHYXH calligraphy, there is a sacred methodology: 

AD TERRA, 
THE FOLIO IS ADORNED WITH BLACK PAINT MADE FROM DISTILLED ASHES OF ALCHEMICAL SACRIFICE 
AD AER, 
MY BREATH IS HELD WITH EACH SCRATCH OF THE QUILL 
AD AQUA, 
EVERY STROKE MUST FLOW WITHOUT HESITATION 
AD IGNIS, THERE IS ONLY MEMORY 

AD SERUM, ET SPORA; 
AD HUMUS ET MYCELIUM; 
THE CALLIGRAPHY IS CREATED WITH INK MADE FROM MY BLOOD 

AD RADIX, ET RAMUS;
ET FOLIUM ET FRUCTUS: 
THE SIGIL’S INSCRIPTION COMPLETES A THRICE-ITERATIVE PROCESS OF CONTEMPLATION 

AD NIMBUS, AD LUX: 
THAT WHICH IS HIDDEN  SHALL MAKE ITSELF KNOWN 









I would really appreciate you reading through all of this and giving me an exceedingly detailed roadmap that addresses all of the queries embedded therein.


Please help me rebrand my creative practice to scale up to the online presence of a multi-disclipinary artist-engineer and spiritual teacher. I’d like a patreon bio written for me please, all in lowercase, vague and mystical sounding (think Lao Tzu / Tao de Ching) 

In addition to the details below, I want to continue to offer my radio show as an early access mp3 download, and I want to make my tier system stronger. I want to change the ‘archive download’ tier as this doesn’t feel like a particularly valuable or regular benefit, and think maybe this could be replaced quite nicely with the taro t tier . I would love to Make it more special than just a patron-only tarot reading but not so much effort as an every-individual patron reading. appreciate your help in figuring this out if possible 

As it stands my tiers are as follows:



**alchemist’s calling | GRIMOIRE  (should I rename this to apprentice’s calling or is that too patronising/condescending to patrons?)**

   MORE INFO:
**Callie Rose Petal** - a noise alchemist, artist-engineer-activist, magick systems architect, and perpetual student of consciousness. I am an aspiring spiritual teacher and a generally deranged, unwell woman harboring an obsession with the shadowy arcane underside of everything. Currently based in Glasgow, I have been releasing musical and live work as ‘Lonely Carp’ for the last decade or so.

### Embracing a New Identity

As I evolve as an artist and creator, I am rebranding myself to become a holistic cultivator of immersive experiences. This rebranding will encompass music, radio, performance art, installation, software/digital innovation, divination, mysticism, and alchemical magick systems architecture. My flagship project under my development company, CR.ux, is HERALD, the world’s first spiritual media platform - a groundbreaking initiative that interfaces the ineffable through personalized data and mystical rituals, running on bespoke algorithms for procedural generation of music and interpretation of tarot spreads utilising my AZOTH framework .

### Vision for the Future

My vision is to offer audio tarot readings each month on the full moon with bespoke scores. Personalizing these readings for patrons is key, and I am exploring various methods, including my AZOTH magick system, elemental categorization, star sign assignments, and user-inputs from surveys/forms/direct contact(?). Scalability and personal connection are essential aspects to consider.

### Website Overhaul

I need to completely revamp my artist website using the .xml export from Squarespace. This new site will be built from the ground up, potentially using the MERN stack with a Scala backend if necessary for efficiency [please suggest the quickest, easiest way I can achieve optimal functionality for this new website].
The website will update dynamically using a workflow I setup (CICD w GitHub pages maybe?) - is there a way to streamline /automate this process further, to make some sort of input form that means I can just push changes or will pushing to origin main on the repo associated Wirth the website just dynamically uipdate? Might have answered my own question there … But the point is I want the website to update when I book shows or have upcoming events/ witching hour / radio show release/ listening party or livestream / eliminating the constant struggle with a website that is out of date for my practice at the time 
 The frontend will feature a hermetically sealed, mysterious, arcane, and miniminal UX, beckoning users under a veil to reveal separate sections for different aspects of my work, as follows:

Website Sections

1. **Lore** – The Bio Section:
   - A detailed biography showcasing my journey, influences, and evolution as an artist, through SHAONWYRM; a metaphysical, allegorical world, built as a metaphor for my life experience and including all of my releases heretofore as part of the narrative canon:

| Release | Year | About |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Your shirt | 2014 | Car seat headrest collab; most played track [INEED TO RENAME THE TRAKC IN LINE WITH LORE] - maybe the leaving behind of the shirt is the beginning of it all somehow? The seed? Maybe maps to the seed not of the AZOTH tree? |
| [lofi demos] | 2014-2020 | [need to amalgamate strongest works into one single release, name / brand it according to the lore, and upload to Spotify to fill in the chronological gap on Spotify] - this provides a nice malleable method to paint the lore’s trajectory with the contextual colours I wish or need to set the story / foreshadow KATABASIS and beyond |
| GAUDIA | 2020 | Instrumental orchestral composition used in the documentary ‘WHAT IT MEANS TO BE’ about my life , transition, evolution of creative practice & recording of KATABASIS |
| T-37 | 2021 | Cover of auld lang syne ‘counting down’ the 37 recorded trans lives lost as a result of transphobic violence in 2021 |
| WAR SORE | 2021 | Noise cabaret EP about leaving an abusive relationship |
| Behold this SACRED STAIN (O! BREATH OF THE ALMIGHTY!) | 2021 | Single release from KATABASIS: an underworld opera - the threshold/entrance (centre track) to the underworld |
| KATABASIS: an underworld opera | 2021 | ‘Help Musicians UK: Do It Differently’-Funded project, studio debut, self-released on vinyl & cassette (don’t want to write that it was self released tho, but rather make it part of the lore that it was concocted/crafted/melted down in a crucible/athanor) |
| THE LABYRINTH CYCLE: iterations on a dream of icarus | 2021 | Three studies based on movement III of KATABASIS, a fragment of the originally planned KATABASIS work , meant to be 18 tracks in 3 parts (666) ,these three tracks were the three corresponding evolution stages for one of the works, the third out of 6 total (similarly to how the bible Is structured, KATABASIS was originally meant to have a short instrumental / sample intro (proverb), a central condensed form of the narrative (parables), and an unfolded, meandering and cacophonous noise composition to round off the evolution (psalm) - this was eventually too much work to implement/too much money to press onto vinyl for all 6 tracks, and so I kept the 6 parables, added a concluding ballad and released as a 7-track LP. |
| ARCHITECT OF MY ABUSE: this chapel you built must surely collapse | 2021 | Orchestral noise EP composed as accompaniment to my live art piece ‘IF ONLY HANDS COULD SPEAK’ - an allegory to the myth of Philomela as a crystallisation of my experience of sexual trauma and commissioned by both the Spit It Out festival (debut) and Homografia festival in Brussels (my first international commission) - documentary was also screened at this festival and I did a Q&A panel after |
| EXANTHEMA EXCELSIS | 2022 | Meandering orchestral noise composition as an alchemical vehicle for contemplation featuring manipulated field recordings |
| FAGOCYTE: my plate is empty I ate everything let me go | 2023 | Noise EP released after the death of my friend and the realisation of the steady dissolving of my deepest love. Grief is analogised as digestion; illuminating my sensory disgust at the process (Arfid) and the nourishment/growth that can reluctantly come from its incomparable suffering. |
| HOLE! HOLLOW! O HOLY OF HOLIES! SOLE! SWALLOW! O SHEPHERD OF SORROWS! | TBA 2024 | Next full length , must include haunting, ceremonial, mathematically accurate and meticulously calculated vocal harmonies; the intervals for which draw inspiration from ancient Neumes [MUST SCOUR MAGICKAL TEXT PDF ARCHIVE IN CASE MY COLLECTION HAS ANY], Gregorian music, balkan folk, drones & ancient (perhaps self-crafted) instruments . The lore has been grazing the depths of the underworld since KATABASIS (with an illusory reach for the heavens (actually Maya)  at the end of the record) and continues to an even deeper point of darkness (Sheol) in this planned, formal concept album. The lore/trajectory of the musical aesthetic /releases  should be written as the journey of a single carp (we will call it something else more biblical / monstrous / Cthulhu / leviathan-esque but it will reference the name ‘lonely carp’ and finally give it a deeper explanation) . This nigredo period, from KATABASIS to here, is th dark night of the soul which forces the transformation of the artist brand and the dissolution of the lonely carp moniker, to mirror the leap up towards the Dragon’s Gate (we will think of a more personalised equivalency for this mythology to apply to the story of SHAONWYRM). This is this first release under the new moniker ; and it may well be a liminal moniker to bridge the final stage of the transmutation (which perhaps ends with my legal name, Callie Rose Petal, to signify a coming into completeness/fullness/spiritual oneness??? Just workshopping currently but maybe) |
| ANABASIS: an outstretched hand in welcoming goodbye | TBA (probably 2028) | The sequel to KATABASIS: an underworld opera, for now planned to be released exactly 7 years after its launch, and perhaps roughly conceptually structured around the nichiren buddhist concept of the ‘ten worlds’ ; ascending through ten tracks, one for each of the realms, to Buddhahood. Important to get across the main sentiment on the journey back upward (within the discography lore) that each of the worlds, or states of consciousness, are accessible from any one world, or state of consciousness. We are able to find enlightenment, any of us, using literally any state of being, inner or outer circumstance as a vehicle for obtaining egoless presence. This release will be very professionally recorded on an exceedingly grand scale. Entire orchestra commissioned, choral ensemble hired, piano parts recorded on a steinway, absolutely highest fidelity mixing and mastering; it will be very expensive to produce and that’s part of the point. This work is a sacrificial offering to whatever deity or deities or demon or demons have tethered themselves to me in the lead up to and following the release of KATABASIS. It is a severing of the ties of the Faustian Bargain and the beginning of a new cycle. This may be yet another moniker change (perhaps my real name), but this may be detrimental from a marketing perspective. So maybe I either keep whatever moniker I come up with for HOLE HOLLOW HOLY OF HOLIES (prev release), or make the imminent moniker change my legal name? I really don’t know. Maybe what needs to happen first is the world building for SHAONWYRM to make sure the lore all fits properly , and to build the website to be able to launch alongside the moniker change on streaming platforms. |



Once SHAONWYRM is built , I need to fit all the releases into a narrative framework accordingly (or rather, develop the world & the narrative lore of the discography together)  The lore section will then include the written text (maybe also/eventually some kind of animation, sound or video) and at the relevant sections of the story there will be clickable links or embedded audio files allowing the reader to listen to the associated release. 

2. **Grimoire** – The Section for Lyrics / Writings: <should I rename this or call the patreon grimoire the ‘EXPANDED GRIMOIRE’ or ‘UNCOVERED GRIMOIRE’ (think of something better sounding) ?>
   - A repository of my lyrics, poems, and writings, serving as a surface level window/screen  into the (publicly accessible facets of) my creative mind.

3. **Rituals** – The Section for Documentation of Performance Art:
   - photographic, ,video and textual documentation of my performance art pieces, capturing the essence and rituals of my live performance work. Need to think of a creative and/or interactive and/or dynamic way to display all this 

4. **Sigils** – The Section for Documentation of Visual Art:
   - A gallery of my visual art, including sigils and other mystical creations. Need to source some kind of scanner or shoot properly with DSLR  to ensure highest possible quality - alternatively, go all the way int he opposite direction and make the depictions / rendering poor quality for hermetic / hidden feel (this must be done quite artfully to be effective however, and would probably take just as / more effort anyway)
- Stretch goal: a dictionary of my Enochian-esque symbolic language for use in rituals / perhaps cross-referencing AZOTH , maybe this is the language of AZOTH, and maybe all the sections of the website link back too the AZOTH page via hyperlinked reference. Maybe the AZOTH page is actually the real hub that all of this is running from 

5. **Visage** – The Section for the Documentary Starring and Scored by Me:
   - A section dedicated to a documentary featuring and scored by me, offering an intimate look at my life and work.
- Behind password (think of magickal term for password/key) or Paywall (link to patreon or one time minimum donation?) 

6. **Aura** – The Section for the Radio Show:
   - Information and archives of my radio show, where I explore music, mysticism, and more.
- RSS feed of all episodes posted to patreon so far 
- Behind donation paywall or patreon subscription paywall (specifically RADIO/AURA tier) 

7. **Coven** – The Section Describing Patreon, with Added Tarot Readings:
   - Details about my Patreon, including previews of the type of exclusive content offered or some kind of intro audio (maybe video but preferably audio to fit the normal modality of my interactions with audiences)
- Elemental / knot alignments / families / houses / CHURCHES of AZOTH 
	- Gives people a sense of inner-community identity 
	- Scratches that human itch of needing to categorise oneself (Myers briggs, astrology , etc)
	- These churches / categories of alignments of audience members determine a level of personalisation for each tarot reading, providing synergy and value to the Tarot tier of my patreon. 
	- Classification system / church sorting algorithm could be based off a tarot reading and an algorithmic analysis of Spotify data or frequencies in recorded voice or something 
		- Off the bat:

<u>COVEN</u>







[[🝪AZOTH Magnum Opus|8. **AZOTH** – The Section for Divination/Tarot/Magick System Exploration:]]
   - An immersive section dedicated to exploring my divination and magick system, providing an interactive experience for users that includes a tarot reading platform (single reading for free, then further uses behind the patreon sub paywall - specifically the initiate’s branch tier, which offers access to CR.ux software releases).
- Make an actual tarot spread interface in the front end that interprets spreads using the AZOTH system in the backend.
- First reading using this (cr.UXible) applet is free, then further readings require subscription to the seeker’s path (TAROT) tier
	- NEED TO BUILD AZOTH-INTERPRETIVE ENGINE 
	- NEED TO DISTILL CHAOTIC SCRIBBLES ABOUT THE MAGICK SYSTEM INTO CONCRETE, DISCRETE DOCS, THEN DEDUCE VARIABLES / PARAMETERS / FUNCTIONS OF AZOTH API AND THEN HOW IT COMES TOGETHER TO FORM A SPREAD INTERPRETATION
	- NEED TO BUILD THE FRONTEND (cr.UXible itself)




### Rebranding Goals

- **Immersive Experiences:** Creating a seamless blend of digital and mystical, offering an engaging, otherworldly experience.
- **Personal Connection:** Ensuring that each patron feels personally connected through bespoke audio tarot readings and tailored content.
- **Holistic Cultivation:** Integrating various forms of challenging, abrasive art and innovative technology to offer an experience of personalised transcendence for users.

### Suggestions for Personalizing Tarot Readings

1. **AZOTH Magick System:** Develop a categorization based on my AZOTH system, assigning readings to patrons based on this framework.
2. **Elemental Categorization:** Consider categorizing readings by elemental signs (earth, air, fire, water) for a more personalized touch.
3. **Astrological Significance:** Use star sign assignments to add a layer of personal connection, though finding a balance to maintain uniqueness for each patron is crucial.
4. **Unique Identifiers:** Develop a system where patrons provide specific personal data (e.g., birthdate, favorite element) in the lead to the Full Moon to create a more tailored reading and encourage patron-engagement 

By embracing this new identity and rebranding, I aim to create a deeper connection with my audience and provide a transformative, immersive experience that transcends traditional boundaries. This journey is not just about evolving as an artist, but about inviting others to join me in exploring the profound and the mystical. I think this is my truest calling. I think this is what it’s all been leading to. 

Thank you so much
