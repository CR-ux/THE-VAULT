THE DIABOLICAL, UNHOLY, ALL-CONFLAGRANT APOSTLE CARPVS MORTVVM 



I am the CARPVS of The Wrist; 
The Beginning And The First To End



whispered 

Thistle’s blissing
little bits 
written on the Precipice 
one 
then two 
then three 
then this Requiem
fastened true 
and sickly quick 
in tension’s tryst 
where Lifting Mist must co-exist 
With wisting of a Pen-Gripped Fist;
This hinging of the Eucharist - 
Skyed Wrists Kiss Sulphur 
(Butterfly)
So Outstretched Hand 
(In Welcoming; Goodbye)
May Know the Sun of Mighty Blows 
And so 
Arise, 
A Bludgeoned Rose
