- Bio







my name is Callie rose petal. 
I am a:
- noise alchemist
- artist-engineer-activist
- magick systems architect
- perpetual student of consciousness, aspiring spiritual teacher 
- generally deranged unwell woman harbouring an obsession with the shadowy arcane underside of everything

currently based in glasgow.

I have been releasing musical and live work as ‘lonely carp’ for the last decade or so. 



Help me flesh this out and expand to explain a brand shift; 
I'm not sure what I want my moniker to be yet, but I know the flagship project of my dev company is as per the attached document

I'd like to become a more holistic cultivator of immersive experiences (encompassing music, radio, performance art, installation, software/digital innovation, divination, mysticism and alchemical magick systems architecture) and rebrand accordingly; offering audio tarot readings with bespoke score  (still need to figure out how to personalise the readings for patrons - perhaps categorising based on my own AZOTH magic system somehow and then assigning to specific patrons as callouts , but for scalability perhaps something a little more generalised like element or star sign might work, though this doesn't feel quite personal enough. I would appreciate your suggestions for this)

I want to entirely rehaul my artist website using the .xml export from squarespace as it stands currently (very much in need of an update) ; and 


I want to rebuild my artist website from the ground up, perhaps using MERN stack (with scala backend if necessary and efficient), and make a hermetically sealed, mysterious , arcane and simple UX, beckoning users under a veil to reveal the comprehensive home of everything I create / do, with separate sections for ;

1. **Lore** – The Bio Section - formatted as an archaic Epic or lost tome / tablet / apocryphon 
2. **Grimoire** – The Section for Lyrics / Writings; stylised as a handwritten spell book 
3. **Rituals** – The Section for Documentation of Performance Art- current OVID’s TRANSFIGURATION 
4. **Sigils** – The Section for Documentation of Visual Art
5. **Visage** – The Section for the Documentary Starring and Scored by me [vimeo link behind hermetic seal (patreon/donation paywall or password) 
6. **Aura** – The Section for the Radio Show featuring RSS podcast link (behind donation / Patreon / album purchase paywall - [is there a way to give auth/access to people with a code from purchasing the vinyl or something like this?]) 
7. **Coven** – The Section Describing my Patreon or offering some kind of exclusive community forum / hermetic Lodge specifically for Patrons only (needs to **extend**, not step on the toes of Patreon functionality, provide something unique to a DIY-hosted platform - please help me think of suggestions) 
8. **AZOTH** - detailed magick system docs; reference materials for personalised monthly tarot readings provided to Patreon community  (seeker’s path tier and above) on the full moon; with original score composition accompaniment
