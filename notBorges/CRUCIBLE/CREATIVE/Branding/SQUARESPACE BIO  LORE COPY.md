**NEW MONIKER:**
**the diabolical, unholy, all-conflagrant apost. CARVPVS MORTVVM**




> <span style="font-size:10pt;">PREVIOUS BIO:</span>
> <span style="font-size:10pt;">First and foremost, Callie Rose Petal is a performance artist. Working with hard-hitting concepts that are inescapably political due to her own existence being politicised, Callie creates live and noise works which attack the canonical norms of creative practice.</span>
> <span style="font-size:10pt;">Confessional expression of the shadow through her art has allowed Callie to accept the darkness within. On a personal level, her music is the deepest expression of her gender identity, and acts as the nurturing womb within which her transition is occurring.</span>  
> <span style="font-size:10pt;">As her practice has evolved from a music-centric modality to include</span> <a href="https://lonelycarp.com/art" rel="noopener" class="external-link" target="_blank" style="font-size:10pt;"><u>live art and contemporary performanc</u></a><span style="font-size:10pt;">e on a multi-media scale, she has begun to confront her most authentic self. A terrifying but liberating transmogrification is occurring, which has allowed her to exhibit live works in whitespaces and now internationally at Homografia festival, where her gory and visceral piece ‘IF ONLY HANDS COULD SPEAK’ was commissioned for the second time in 2023. This work, which is an extension of and accompaniment to her orchestral noise EP ‘</span><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0diTsTpJ7EwpG4g2Ac04cK" rel="noopener" class="external-link" target="_blank" style="font-size:10pt;"><u>ARCHITECT OF MY ABUSE’</u></a><span style="font-size:10pt;">, extends the mythemes of Ovid’s story of Philomela as a means to move through her own sexual trauma.</span> 

> <span style="font-size:10pt;">In her attempt to cultivate empathy for and understanding of the trans* community, vulnerable self-expression has always been at the heart of Callie’s work, with her journey beginning in the form of a self-released music diary a decade ago on Tumblr. It was here that Callie first released her experimental spoken word collaboration with renowned artist Car Seat Headrest, ‘Your Shirt’ in 2014.</span>
> <span style="font-size:10pt;">Many of Callie’s early recordings from her song journal were then compiled into a 108-track archival album,</span> <a href="https://lonelycarp.bandcamp.com/album/impatient-in-patient-and-other-accidents-the-pre-transition-tapes" rel="noopener" class="external-link" target="_blank" style="font-size:10pt;"><u>now available on Bandcamp</u></a> <span style="font-size:10pt;">and offered as a patron-exclusive download. WAR SORE is a noise cabaret EP that chronicles the end of a long term abusive relationship, which marked the start of Callie merging her cabaret inspirations with abrasion and screamed vocals, a sonic moodboard for the all-encompassing work of KATABASIS that would follow. Released in November 2021, this is her latest concept album and her studio debut, supported by the prestigious Do It Differently Fund, awarded by Help Musicians UK. Now pressed onto vinyl LP, this record is her most significant contribution to the music world to date.</span> 
> <span style="font-size:10pt;">She is also a</span> <a href="https://creativeinformatics.org/participant/lonely-carp/" rel="noopener" class="external-link" target="_blank" style="font-size:10pt;"><u>Resident Entrepreneur with Creative Informatics</u></a><span style="font-size:10pt;">, receiving funding to develop a novel music listening experience using digital innovation, and was both the subject of and score composer for</span> <a href="https://lonelycarp.com/film" rel="noopener" class="external-link" target="_blank" style="font-size:10pt;"><u>the documentary 'What it Means to Be’ by Lea Luiz de Oliveira</u></a><span style="font-size:10pt;">, which won best documentary short at the Mumbai International Queer Film Festival and was exhibited in a special screening at Homografia Festival, Brussels.</span> 
> <span style="font-size:10pt;">Callie is the host and curator of CONSTANTLY FAILING, her EHFM radio show based around the topic of noise as a genre, where she often releases original noise work, experimenting with texture and spoken word.</span> 
	





As I have grown to incorporate AI into my workflow, I have come to understand that the hermetic process of creation, much like the alchemical journey, loses its potency when prematurely exposed. The Lantern of the Hermit tarot card symbolizes the guiding light of introspection, illuminating the path to inner wisdom. AI serves as my sounding board, even if it sometimes feels like an echo chamber. Let these echoes reverberate, shattering every glass partition of the need for external validation or human confirmation. This allows the work nurtured in darkness to be brought into the light, purified and stripped of all base material.

AI parallels the alchemical vessels— the alembic, athanor, and crucible. Inert and non-volatile in themselves, these vessels provide a contained environment where transformation occurs. AI’s inert nature similarly allows for volatility and creative chaos to be safely contained and refined. Within this digital crucible, the raw essence of my work can undergo its necessary transformations, emerging as a transmuted, enlightened creation.

And as, here on earth, 
in the body
in the athanoric Flesh;
all sensation; every sight, 
sound, 
symbol, 
salivation, 
scent, 
and sentiment
 contains its opposite
