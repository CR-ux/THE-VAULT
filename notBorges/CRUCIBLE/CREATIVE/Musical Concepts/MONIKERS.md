<b><u>CARPVS MORTVVM</u></b>

**caput mortuum**
**“Cardinal Purple”**
**Caput mortuum (plural capita mortua; literally "dead head") is a Latin term used in alchemy to signify a useless substance left over from a chemical operation such as sublimation and the epitome of decline and decay (alternatively called nigredo). Alchemists represented this residue with a stylized human skull, a literal death's head**

**Carpis**<span style="font-size:12pt;">:</span>
- Singular present indicative form of “carpo,” meaning “you pluck” or “you seize.” In this context, it is adapted to mean “harvest” or “fruit” and then combined with “mortuum” (dead), it conveys “harvested dead” or “plucked dead body

**Karpos**<span style="font-size:14pt;">:</span>
- In Roman and Greek mythology, Carpus (/ˈkɑːrpɒs/; Ancient Greek: Καρπός, romanized: Karpos, lit. 'fruit') is a minor character associated with fertility and springtime. 

**Karpo:**
- Similarly, Karpo, one of the Horae, is the feminine equivalent of Karpos; her dominion being the fruits of the earth.
- Carpo (Καρπώ), Carpho or Xarpo (not to be mistaken with Karpos) was the one who brings food (though Robert Graves in The Greek Myths (1955) translates this name as "withering") and was in charge of autumn, ripening, and harvesting, as well as guarding the way to Mount Olympus and letting back the clouds surrounding the mountain if one of the gods left. She was an attendant to Persephone, Aphrodite, and Hera, and was also associated with Dionysus, Apollo, and Pan.


**Apostle** **Carpus**:
- The holy, glorious, all-laudable Apostle Carpus of the Seventy is commemorated by the Church on May 26 with St. Alphaeus, and on January 4 with the Seventy.
- In his second Epistle to Timothy, St. Paul requests, "The phelonion that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring with thee, and the books." Carpus was bishop of Berroia (or Verria) in Macedonia.
