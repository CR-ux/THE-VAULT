my name is callie rose petal. 
I am a:
- noise alchemist
- artist-engineer-activist
- magick systems architect
- perpetual student of consciousness, aspiring spiritual teacher 
- generally deranged unwell woman harbouring an obsession with the shadowy arcane underside of everything

currently based in glasgow.

I have been releasing musical and live work as ‘lonely carp’ for the last decade or so.
