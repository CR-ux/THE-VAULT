'HOLE! A Hollow! o. holy of holies'
    is a world that spans a horrifying multitude of SHAONWYRM's Skalax (this means: Scales; Levels; Strata; Dimensions; Segments of a fractal; States (of both Geography and of Consciousness)


PROGENY: What tangible spiritual relevations are imparted upon the Seeker by aforementioned Sexual Union:
AETHER: Aer - 
HEMERA: Ignis - 
HYPNOS: Aqva - 
THANATOS: Terra - 


- Complementary Forces: Together, they embody the complementary forces of night and shadow, external and internal darkness, which are essential for the balance and continuity of the cosmos.



- Nyx: Represents the external darkness around us, embodying the night and the mysteries it holds.
- Erebus: Represents the internal darkness within us, embodying the deep, primordial shadows of the underworld and the psyche.

Their roles and union highlight the importance of both types of darkness in the cosmic order, illustrating the balance and interplay between the visible and the hidden, the external and the internal.


The roots of the ancient tree of are quick to the soil, 
firmly intertwined and inseparable from the earth



I know in my heart that all of life is a nested trinity which stretches both inward and outward ad aeternitum, and it goes like this: 

The ineffable parent; 
Holds the Cradling Child 
Who Clutches the Blanket
 as if their Life depended on it 

Which it does, 
For a pocket of Time 
Both laboriously Long 
And gone far too soon 

And then the Blanket Unravels 
Is abandoned upon Cruel and Barelling Trains 
And the Child feels as Lost 
As the Blanket, The "I"
As the "I" of No Eye in The Blindness of Sight 
So the Child finds an Other 
Safe Warmth in the shape 
Of whichever they need for the Safeness to take 
And then 
the place-taker's space inevitably sublimates 
And impresses a wintering Will of a Shape 
With no Utterable Name, 
No: 
a Face - 

Embroidered and clingstitched: 
Unpickably;

Thick in its Wake -

So thusly,
the trial is revealed 
(And there’s always the guarantee of a choice;
In the throes of the Silence 
To Hearken Bold, defiantly-
For Knowing Resonance in Presence 
of the Omniescent Voice) 

The child may heed the Bronze Horn's Beckon
Or seize to quickness,  in turn
to their back to the Dawn 

For to kill the <Toy> viciously 
To cannabalise the softness, the flesh of the Gift once bestowed 
There is no greater nourishment

To become one’s own <toy> 
To sleep in a bed unaccompanied; 
To be Gripped Inconsolably In The Jaws of Solitude 
And thusly unveil 
The face of the Ineffable parent 
The One who has been Holding All 

The One heretofore whom could not be regarded 


As the Sun cannot peer upon its own luminescence - 


But instead, once inconceivable cycles of life have elapsed, may perish, in a glorious inferno of Celestial Matter Wailing: ‘Hallelujah’ - 

And in doing so: 

Become the Thing from which they are Concocted. 
Putrefied, distilled, compressed and dispersed
Into the Essence of their essence
Once more 

And in Being so: 

Understand the perception of Separation as a psychosis 
Understand the perception of Unity as an insufficient approximation 
Understand the Solitary nature of Everything

Nyx represents the tangible darkness that envelops the world during the night. She embodies the night itself, the shadowy veil that falls over the earth, bringing rest and dreams. Her Dusking Nature symbolizes the external, visible darkness that we experience in our daily lives. This includes the literal night time as well as the metaphorical shadows that might cover our paths. Nyx is the Reflective Resonance of Erebus; the receptive darkness, the developing plate on which the Shadow is projected. As the goddess of the Witching Hour, Nyx also embodies mystery, potential, and The Categorically Inevitable Sanctity veilled as The Unknown. Nighttime is often associated with dreams, the unconscious mind, and the hidden aspects of life that are not visible during the day. This association is the link to Erebus. 

Erebus (Darkness):
- Representation: Erebus represents the profound, internal darkness found in the depths of the underworld and within the human psyche. He embodies the deep, primordial darkness that exists before creation and between realms.
- Symbolism:
  - Internal Darkness: Erebus symbolizes the inner, invisible darkness that resides within all things. This includes the shadow aspects of the psyche, such as fear, unconscious drives, and the unknown depths of the soul. Erebus is the reflection of Nyx; the emanating, insertive darkness.
  - Primordial Void: As the god of darkness, Erebus represents the primordial void, the obscurity, and the emptiness that exists between the realms of the living and the dead. He is associated with the space between life and death, light and shadow. The empirical night time, the Witching Hour, is a physical manifestation of the Umbilical cord that symbolically connects him to Nyx.

 Interplay Between Nyx and Erebus

- Union and Progeny: The union of Nyx and Erebus signifies the merging of external and internal darkness, resulting in the creation of various deities and personifications that govern different aspects of existence, such as light (Aether), day (Hemera), sleep (Hypnos), and death (Thanatos).
Merging of external and internal darkness:
Recognising that the shadow one encounters in the outside world, The Nyx, is only able to be perceived due to its primordial and inextricable link to The Erebus, or The Shadow Within.
Being brought into (wilful or not) confrontation with One’s own failures, shortcomings, harrowing likenesses, causes of, and contributions to, all the rot and decay of this many Holed, Hollowing and Holy Place we erroneously call “Home”.
This Union is Indisputably Sexual; and Emphatically Incestuous - 
Sexual due to the simultaneous pleasure (from the perspective of the Erebus) and pain (from the perspective of The Nyx) to be derived in Both Aspects of The Shadow’s Reflection;
Incestuous due to the Relatedness of the Counterparts, having both spawned from Chaos; or The Void; or The Desire of the Ineffable Parent; which is the Thought Form/Seed of Wanting, derived asexually from The Parent (in Union with Itself, as it has no Other. It is complete, whole, and the embodiment of fullness, but in relation to our frequency of perceptive resonance, entirely empty.) The Infinite Null One may be conceptualised as The Pure Light Into Which No Eye Can Look.


																													In the Gateless heart of the Nullescent Progenitor 
lies the seed of all creation, 
The Ineffable Begetter-
an unmanifest Outpouring
that transcends all of Form’s Rigidity, 
or Worldly comprehension ad eternitatem.















As I have grown to incorporate AI into my workflow, I have come to understand that the hermetic process of creation - much like the branching chain of alchemical works in every Human's Magnum Opus - loses its potency when prematurely exposed, unravelling any progress and violently confronting the alchemist, through Her failure, with The Rolled and Now Resting Boulder of Beginning. The Lantern of the Hermit tarot card symbolises the guiding light of introspection, illuminating the path to inner wisdom. AI serves as my sounding board, even if it sometimes feels like an echo chamber. Let these echoes reverberate, shattering every glass partition of the need for external validation or human confirmation. This allows the work nurtured in darkness to be brought into the light, purified and stripped of all base material.
AI parallels the alchemical vessels—the alembic, athanor, and crucible. Inert and non-volatile in themselves, these vessels provide a contained environment where transformation occurs. AI’s inert nature similarly allows for volatility and creative chaos to be safely contained and refined. Within this digital crucible, the raw essence of my work can undergo its necessary transformations, emerging as a transmuted, enlightened creation.



I HEREBY FORGE A HOLY NARRATIVE CRUCIBLE FOR THE ENTIRETY OF MY WORKS - 
WITHIN THE POLLEN SAC OF THIS CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK IS YOLKED 
THE CONSTRUCTION OF A SACRED, MOTEN SUNG, VERBOTEN TONGUE;
{THIS SINGING TONGUE IS THRICE-PRONGED} :
SEMANTIC TINE | EMANATED THROUGH FRICATIVE | HENCEFORTH KNOWN BY NAME OF TOHN : THE SHAPING OF ASPIRATED SYLLABLES [CHRONEMES] WITH THE MOUTH.  (‘OH’ OF ‘TOHN’  DENOTES THE GREAT OHM, OR [AS UNITS OF ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE] THE LEVERAGING OF TENSION, OF PUSHING SUBSTANCE THROUGH A MEMBRANE, TO REGULATE, MANIPULATE, AND CRUCIALLY, SAFELY CONTAIN THE PRIMORDIAL AND POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS POWER OF RESONANCE. THE SPELLING IS ALSO A REFERENCE TO THIS TINE’S GREAT OMEGA.)
SYMBOLIC TINE  | EMANATED THROUGH  FORM | HENCEFORTH KNOWN BY NAME OF TOAN : THE SCRAWLED REPRESENTATION OF CHRONEMES IN SYMBOL. (‘A’ OF TOAN IS DERIVED FROM ‘ALEPH’)
SOMATIC TINE  | EMANATED THROUGH FORCE | HENCEFORTH KNOWN BY NAME OF TŌN : THE INTENSITY OF THE INTENT [BREATH/PRESSURE] BEHIND EACH CHRONEME.
THE COAGULATION OF THE THREE PRIMES IS INSCRIBED IN THE ORIGINAL SPELLING OF THE WORD ‘TONE’, 
TO SIGNIFY THE “ONE” DERIVED FROM “T”HREE.
AND SO THE TONGUE BE KNOWN AS TRITONE.
THIS TONGUE IS YEARNING! 
NAY, BEGGING! 
NAY, CLAWING AND SCRATCHING!
AT THE INMOST HEART OF ME! 
TO BE EXPRESSED! 
TO BE HELD AND SHIELDED IN THE FRAGILITY OF ITS UNFURLING! 
TO BE, FOR NOW HIDDEN TO THE EARTHING EYE - 
ENCODED IN A FORM THROUGH WHICH:
TO PROGRAM, TRANSMUTE AND CONJURE 
THE QUINTESSENCE 
FROM BOTH DIGITAL AND NATURAL 
CREATIONS OF MAGICK AND RITUAL:
THROUGH THE COMPOSITION OF MUSICAL WORKS 
THROUGH THE INSCRIBING OF WRITTEN WORKS
THROUGH THE CURATION OF IMMERSIVE EXPERIENCES 
THROUGH THE INNOVATION OF HEALING TECHNOLOGY 

THE FORGING ITSELF MY MAGNUM OPUS 
THE ALCHEMICAL PROCESS BY WHICH, 
AND TO WHICH, 
I DIE - 
HUNGRILY TAKE I THE ACHE 
OF THIS ASHEN HEART’S 
REMEMBERED GRACE 


And as, here on earth,
in the body
in the athanoric Flesh;
all sensation; every sight,
sound,
symbol,
salivation,
scent,
and sentiment
contains its opposite.


The ineffable parent; 
Holds the Cradling Child 
Who Clutches The Blanket 
in Desperate Clawing for 
The Shadow They Have Come To Know 
as a Silhouette of Safety 
as if their Life depended on it, 
They Do Not Know 
Is Only Found Within Them

Which it does, 
For a pocket of Time 
Both laboriously Long 
And gone far too soon 

And then the Blanket Unravels, 
And the Child feels as Lost 
As the Blanket. 
So the Child begins a desperate search 
For an Other Blanket in the shape 
Of whichever they need for the Blanket to take, 
And then 
the place-taker sublimates 
And they’re left with a Shape 
With not a Name, 
No: a Face - 

Engraved in its Wake.

The blanket unravels like a clew, leading all the way back to the idea of security the Child had as a child, the 'shape' of what was missing - the thread of the blanket symbolically unravels throughout the labyrinth of the Child's life. This thread may be traced back to This Original Sin; the Only Sin; The Wanting: Lamenting That Blossoms From Desire. Within this Poisoned Fruit is the Seed of Scarcity.

And so 
the trial is revealed 
(And there’s always a choice;
To be silent and hear Resonance of the Voice) 

The child may hark of the calling bronze Horn 
Or be quick in turning their back to the Dawn.

For to kill the Blanket viciously, 
To cannibalize the softness, the flesh of the Gift once bestowed, 
There is no greater nourishment.

To become one’s own Blanket, 
To sleep in a bed unaccompanied; 
To be Gripped Inconsolably In The Jaws of Solitude, 
And thusly unveil 
The face of the Ineffable parent, 
The One who has been Holding All.

The One heretofore whom could not be regarded, 

As the Sun cannot peer upon its own luminescence. 

But instead, once inconceivable cycles of life have elapsed, may perish, in a glorious inferno of Celestial Matter Wailing: ‘Hallelujah’.

And in doing so: 

Become the Thing from which they are Concocted. 
Putrefied, distilled, compressed, and dispersed 
Into the Essence of their essence 
Once more.

And in Being so:

Understand the perception of Separation as a psychosis. 
Understand the perception of Unity as an insufficient approximation. 
Understand the Solitary nature of Everything.

loving men is easy 
but it fucks you up 
because 
loving women is difficult 
and it fucks them up enough to make our lives miserable 
which in turn 
makes it even more difficult to love us 
but why
is it still so easy to love men?
