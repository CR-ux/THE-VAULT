for each of these reimagined album covers featuring AZOTHYXH calligraphy, there is a sacred methodology: 

AD TERRA, 
THE FOLIO IS ADORNED WITH BLACK PAINT MADE FROM DISTILLED ASHES OF ALCHEMICAL SACRIFICE 
AD AER, 
MY BREATH IS HELD WITH EACH SCRATCH OF THE QUILL 
AD AQUA, 
EVERY STROKE MUST FLOW WITHOUT HESITATION 
AD IGNIS, THERE IS ONLY MEMORY 

AD SERUM, ET SPORA; 
AD HUMUS ET MYCELIUM; 
THE CALLIGRAPHY IS CREATED WITH INK MADE FROM MY BLOOD 

AD RADIX, ET RAMUS;
ET FOLIUM ET FRUCTUS: 
THE SIGIL’S INSCRIPTION COMPLETES A THRICE-ITERATIVE PROCESS OF CONTEMPLATION 

AD NIMBUS, AD LUX: 
THAT WHICH IS HIDDEN  SHALL MAKE ITSELF KNOWN 









I would really appreciate you reading through all of this and giving me an exceedingly detailed roadmap that addresses all of the queries embedded therein.


Please help me rebrand my creative practice to scale up to the online presence of a multi-disclipinary artist-engineer and spiritual teacher. I’d like a patreon bio written for me please, all in lowercase, vague and mystical sounding (think Lao Tzu / Tao de Ching) 

In addition to the details below, I want to continue to offer my radio show as an early access mp3 download, and I want to make my tier system stronger. I want to change the ‘archive download’ tier as this doesn’t feel like a particularly valuable or regular benefit, and think maybe this could be replaced quite nicely with the taro t tier . I would love to Make it more special than just a patron-only tarot reading but not so much effort as an every-individual patron reading. appreciate your help in figuring this out if possible 

As it stands my tiers are as follows:



**alchemist’s calling | GRIMOIRE  (should I rename this to apprentice’s calling or is that too patronising/condescending to patrons?)**

- ACCESS TO THE GRIMOIRE (formerly termed ‘song journal’)

- *unreleased musical works in exclusive audio posts with or without accompanying prose

offerings of the alchemist's calling, plus:

early stream/mp3 download of my bimonthly EHFM radio show and RSS podcast:

"the medium is the wreckage" - an exploration of the myriad forms abrasion takes in music.
