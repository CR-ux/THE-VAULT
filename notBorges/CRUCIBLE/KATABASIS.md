- I’VE BEEN CLAWING THROUGH THE EARTH 
Забивам ноктите си през земята 

- REACHING FOR VICARIOUS POWER 
Протягам се към чужда сила

- I’VE BEEN GRASPING MY WHOLE LIFE 
Сграбчвам през целия си живот

- AT PUNCHING FISTS AND KICKING FEET 
удряйки с юмруци и ритайки с крака

- OUR LOVE WAS MADE TO BURY ITSELF 
любовта ни се само-заровяше - така бе създадена

- AND FILL MY MOUTH WITH ROTTING SOIL 
и пълнеше устата ми с гниеща почва

- I’VE BEEN CLAWING AT THE ROOTS
забивах ноктите си за корените

- AND PULLING ALL MY FLOWERS DOWN 
и издърпвах всичките си цветя
