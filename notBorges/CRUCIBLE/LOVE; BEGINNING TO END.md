permalink: LOVE; BEGINNING TO END
---
O The shimmering blindness
Of a beginning;
Intoxicating -

As yet another Ending caresses my hair 
bicep bulging as a lock is tucked 
and turned behind my ear
the Ending shifts his weight in finality 
across the bench
we have come to call our own
to smile, popping spit bubbles 
formed in the corners of his lips
to lean 
into the crook of my neck 
to whisper down my closing throat
and gently tell me this:

"You Are 
your own great river
Your love 
like stepping stones”

Each man a gateway
to the next
Each one
a quiet wave
A reflection’s shudder
In a ripple of judgement
a life-rafted opportunity
To be seen
as a mirror"

Then in 
the spoiling swirls of love
Gripped at the ankle
By some forgotten weed
Nicked at the knee 
By the sharpest rocks 
the Men condensed 
and pressured themselves into
and I am dragged 
in my nakedness
skin burning, like a comet 
an uncontainable ether 
tethered to this wretched weight
a thinning shard of glass 
and a makeup brush
to shape a heaving block 
of granite 

And at the bottom
I plant my insignificant seeds
Letting rot my shameful garden
Upon the surface
Laying waste 
my raked and beaten heart

The dulling visage
Of all my endings;
Unbearable.
