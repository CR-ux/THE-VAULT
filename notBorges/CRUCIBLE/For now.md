permalink: For now

Few things are as beautiful as falling asleep with the bedroom window open 
To hear how inside of the earth you are while simultaneously being outside of it

And that liminal space 
When you believe you have misplaced something
Of great importance 
When you exist in a state of holding the breath 
When, at the top of a flight of stairs 
Your foot falls through the air 
This is our time on Earth 
A holding of the breath 
A waiting for certainty 
A liminal space 

First, a thought

I had a thought
Much like these thoughts 
I am thinking now

It must have been a thought 
Because it came from the void 
I crafted it with only my essence 
My energy moulded it to words 
And I let it go 
And it grew quietly into a light 

And then there came a day, 
It must have been a day 
For there was Light 
And I knew that this meant day 
Although I could not tell how I knew this 

And then I had a body 
And it must have been me 
For I controlled it 
But I also knew that it wasn’t me 
And that “me” wasn’t the same 
As the I that pulled its limbs 

And then the body had a Voice 
That could speak my words 
And the words became Ideas
And this felt like a freedom 
But then I became at the mercy of the freedom
Imprisoned within it 
And the body began to believe it was the I 
(And she asked no body why I had been separated)
And the body began to hurt
For endless days upon days 
(And she asked no Body why I had been separated)
And she was thrown across rooms, a ragdoll of itching cloth
Vibrating into and out of pain 
Ensnared by pleasure, too
Until the me was shaken into the realisation
That she was not alone 
And the I spoke to me 
Finally rising out of its Silence, saying:

“Woman is born an animal, and Will, carrion 
And chariot pulls horse, and man pulls his God 
And clothes Himself 
In layers upon layers of Earth
And he is buried and excavated 
Until in the heart she find that of which his God cannot speak  
Until out of the body he find that which her God cannot see 
In the soft holding of the breath of the unbreathable.
For now warm is the cauldron, The water of womb -
Boil it shall if needed, and freezeth over in perpetuity!
All things reach their end, which becomes their beginning in the unending All. No things begin at All, but are in a constant state of becoming it.
And for thee who do not find Spirit in the Silence within you, the unhearable will attempt to show itself through the Noise, lest ye be deafened by it.
The Noise cometh Not from Silence, but be wrapped in it, as newborn is swaddled by Mother. 
The Noise, in its disorder, is the natural order of all things, for we are all, each of the one of us, blinded by everlasting Light. 
You ask me again and again why I have separated you, and I have offered no reply for good reason.
The only separation is a separation of realities, and the one of Dirt shall teach you of your cleanness 
You have pushed all the flowers I have given you into early graves, and so the air around you has become stale.
Your eyes sprout creeping things of great power, those who, sprouting into existence, bury themselves into the portal of your mouth, whereupon you eat of them like a hungry devil.
You are made of the flesh, You are not made from it. 
Decay is a contemporary, and death a conversation.
Behold the Almighty Pendulum! 
Which swingeth like a trebuchet 
And a playground swing 
With beings that push and beings that pull 
And beings that push and pull their Being 
And in their equal and opposite nature
Become the Stillness itself
Generation after generation,
Diluting in their essence and exponent in chaos 
The infinite has no measurable face
But the finite which come from it has two,
Then three, 
And back to One again.
And all of Life, a fractal.
You will be captured in the gaze of the Two  
Until you know the mirrored One that birthed them 
Withstand the burning of thine own Eye -
Study the wretched mirror
And in doing so, Shatter it 
All things die, thank Goddess!
All things are death except the all.
Become the rot! And so know vitality! 
Become aflame! And let your heart cooled! 
Be as a whimpering child to look upon your end! 
You! 
The Bloody! 
The Harlot! 
Athena of The North!  
Fisher of The South! 
The Stained and Stainless! 
The Remembering of Providence!
The Afflicted and the Needy! 
See With Eye of Newt! 
Strike with Club of Jude!
The Fallen Woman!
The Screaming Widow! 
As rabid dog in moonlight! 
Be the very Noise itself! 
And so be wrapped 
in the Silence”
