The Holy Lyre Strings ring out 
 The body in its burning 
knowing
Only fire -
Intimately 
In its going -
those microscopic fibres from which to heal itself

A certain burning  to hold onto.

The bitter stinging nerve now severed, stirring stitch, dissolved and silent rapturing
Hark-
Are all my failures singing?

Protectors I have known; To Be:

Projections of my own becoming.


A something spindling to hold onto 
Made up in fiction-bricks, 
a mortal Waits under great aching of gentleness and unshakeable immolating gratitude for

Emptiness to clear, make way for window 

opening, 

To breathe, 

In 

and burn and oxygen and Spark and fizzle 

Out

And weighted are my fingers 
On kissing all the outside air 

In rest a steeple-needle punctures
The words 
He wrote as trailings, drugged and lugged upon my skies


And dredged, and dipped, and drowned in weakness, to hold onto Dark-
An hour to honour all their meaning, unblackening of both my eyes

Part One: Christina’s World 

A ring for each
of the old rope fingers 
Unable to withhold their labours 
Or hold a sapling stem 
A jawbone snaps impossibly:
Sick as Erysicthon, screeching:
“Oh, this dark punishment was not my due! Come, finish with my murder your black deed, so nothing wicked may remain undone”
It is 
done 
The tongue retracts 
Preparing for the leap 
Into a pit of sand 
The mouth 
wrapping all of it’s thinning outing ugliness 
Paper weighing justly nothing 
In vein, a ripping fallen fallacy 
Tearing up around the box 
I am That it is done

He taketh all this time 
Give endless hefty blows
For the sake 
Of making your immortal 
garment 

Do not mistake 
The stillness of my tongue 
For speechlessness 
Do not mistake 
My lack of words 
For Silence 

Solitude be
The greatest romance 
Solitude, thee
Communion 
 
I arose
In need of a vehicle 
I awoke 
Beset with the need to flee 

Pestilence enters the chamber in time and signature 
The rock rolls away from the skull 
thoughts swarm and plague the restless heart 

Hark

The angels have all left her bedside 

I hold onto Him 
Like my mother’s sleeve 
Before the hellish gate 
weeping for transfiguration 


Part two: The Sacrifice 

The fleshiest part Of me Exposed 
Unripe, 
The glossy, shyest eye 
a lychee 
Shrouded in crust 
Too dry for crying 
This simmered pillaged little life 
An ember 
A sacrifice 

The dreamless nights 
Denied in sleep and longed for; 
Deliciously 
Since dreaming has returned to me 
The sucking gripping drying socket void 
The stone, a heart 
Abraxas chiselled  
Growing breast where breath should be 

And scalpel burns 
The spaces wide (at night)
Where Morpheus may dissipate 
And all the demons hide 


The sacrificial Janus 
And sarcastic sisyphus 
Are fucking 
The life 
Out of each other 

And rows of roses 
Are falling in mourning 

The light blue is seeping 
A pang of forgiveness 
And all of us sleeping
And all of us sleeping 

A life set in plaster
On indolent waves 
The eaten, the restless
Nothing could hold this water 

A chalice of onyx 
My insides, nipped outside 
Tucked behind  another
skinny 
Skinny
 cigarette 

And such guilt
For existing in this 
Absolute uniqueness 
Alone in this togetherness 
Indebted to the redness of regret 


And all of us sleeping 
And caressing our hair 
And intimacy, currency 
I Gave Up Absolutely 
Nothing 
In moments of presence 
delicious 
locked stare 

The guilt: testosterone
Life's punctuation of
Death's sentence 
Guilt is my mirror 
Always
has been 

And beads of milky sweat 
Are falling 
From janus's forehead 
Collecting a foundation 
(Brick by briquet)
Two shades too light 
The salt and the oil mixing together
Submerging infinitesimal crumbs within friends 

And janus is tired now 
As the sphere of sweat undulates 
In the beesting of an eternity 
Of a moment 
Suspended in gravity
Falling, into the open mouth 
Of sispyhus 
And now from the pore
Poor excretion
Touching land after travelling 
(Denying christ three times 
Three days without estrogen)


Thisbe's fingertip outstretched through a break in a fence  
Kissing transparent skin 
Of the tongue 
Of sisyphus 
In the palm of Pyramus 

Injection 
To the armed morpheus 
Castrated 
All of us sleeping 

And waking a theft 
A serpentine requiem
is swallowing its own cautionary tale

Sisypus is whispering 
Condensation into
 waxing waning ear 

Tastebud to cilia
Saliva to blood
Water 
to whine 

Janus turns over 
Assumes the position 
Safety
In cut wires 
Weightlessness
An abattoir hook 

Singing He/Hymns
Believing,
So solidly: 

"I will never deserve 
To be touched 
To be kissed -
my endings are my world 
My endings are everything
Something left a hole right down the centre of me 
The spinal reed I wrote you from
Floating at the end of a fishing line 
There’s a little light that sings in there 
(It’s not so dark inside)
I don’t want to write you in red, I just want to read 
Every word you print upon my sky 
Into branching veins of arms 
and honour all their meaning:
This doorway 
Between the softness of your chest
and the inside of your sweater 
And how your dick feels in crinkled pyjamas 
Your taste in my mouth when falling asleep
And the sound of you reading to me 
And thinking it good just to sink 
into the saturday morning cartoons 
Of the rest of what we will do together”


And His wilted nose is bleeding 
The eyes in the back of the head 
Are blinding 
And sisyphus licks the dripped iron from shoulder 


Sisyphus 
Whispering 
So gently, 
"Beginning like this 
My darling -
How could i ever 
hold up the weight
Of your boulder"


Part three: Minari

lessons from the Willow House 
I have learned 
In a stitch-picked patch of sky 
To love myself 
One moment at a time 
Moments laying on top of one another 
Like naked bodies 
Offering warmth 
As sacrament 

I have learned 
In a stolen loaf of bread 
A sprig of grass 
To be with myself 
One slice at a time 
Holding the wheat to my nose 
To breathe in the harvest 
And know what I have reaped 

I am learning 
In a shattered locket 
Consigned to never being opened again 
In its broken hinge 
And the brute force that broke it 
That I am more than this 
Than the visage of a silk scarf 
Taking flight in a breeze
And leaving such vital blood 
vessels 
behind 

I will learn 
Again 
In a bed 
In a room 
In a house made of willow 
To remember who I am 
And the fruit the seed came from 
And the leaves rotting 
Into everything I never was 

I will learn this 
All of it 
From ancient tomes 
And the briefest note 
Penned in a single breath 

Part Four: Lost Wisdom 

Growing 
# This
Twisted 
And deciduous body 
Indebted 
These ever grieving limbs
 just reaching 
Every
Body 
Leaves 
Reaching 
Every
Body it must 
just 
Be destined for the dust

Of Reaching 
Of
Branches


the inevitable motif is an  ancient echo, distant burning structures of safety, its resonance will far outlive your candle’s flicker

the searing strings sweep the floor crawled upon, unavoidable puppetry, marionette pyre, too distant to be met with, white hot, noxious, far, far too close, obsidian skin basted in the lasting night’s sweat 

the drum 
in its vast goodbyeing 
and its long so longing 
has long before now been beaten, 
beaten, beat and burned 
in the  heartskipping rhythm  
of ailing throb of the neck 
In pain
Wreckage of irreconcilable distance 

the raw throat, cooked, bubbling, simmering
Blistered and shimmered It scratches and flattens the pattern of mattering in stitch picked sickly and distantly severed discordant excuse for a melody 

while crescendoed rope-throes of memory swells towards felling trees bereft of their owls and begging to howl in the bowels of the flame 

No 

No name , there is none 

Only facing up to the face 

Of the God who forgot 
to lay the stippled bricks of ill-fated 
still awaited, slipping from the fist 
dripping drop drop drop drop drop of rain 
to the sunken plans of a drunken man and your humble bunk 
your chunk of mess, 
your apartheid state of desiccated plains 


the trumpet is remaindered in its cracked open valves 

Melts into watching - 

piano keys locked on inferno of vice of desire neglected and unfulfilled 

for the home coming overture of  falling
 to ashes


the upfront and muting sound of what fetid ember of hope was left and bereft in the leaves of the leaving 
The eaves  so poorly designed 
The siphoning flight of what might be salvageable 
behind 

Chiselled jutting edges longing for roundness of shape 


The House In The Distance  -

Ablaze -

The House 

Past returning 

Blinding 
Licking
Fading
Fleeting
Shrinking
Light 

Going
