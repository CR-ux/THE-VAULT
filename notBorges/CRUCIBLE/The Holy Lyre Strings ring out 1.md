The body knows to heal itself

A certain something to hold onto.

The bitter stinging nerve now severed, stirring stitch, dissolved and silent rapturing
Hark-
Are all my failures singing?

Protectors I have known; To Be:

Projections of my own becoming.


A something spindling to hold onto Made up in fiction-bricks, a mortal Waits in gentleness and gratitude for

Emptiness to clear, make way for window opening, and breathe, and burn and oxygen and Spark-

And weighted are my fingers On kissing all the outside air In rest a steeple-needle punctures
The words He wrote as trailings, drugged and lugged upon my skies


And dredged, and dipped, and drowned in weakness, to hold onto Dark-
An hour to honour all their meaning, unblackening of both my eyes
