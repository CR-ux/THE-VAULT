it's set about 1000 years in the future, when Numans have populated mars and the 4 gallilean moons of jupiter, in these eden-project esque bubble structures, filled with gigantic genetically modified trees, arranged in the shape of stars. Earth's is a three pointed star, called Triskelia. Each point of the star contains industry and residents that prioritise a particular pillar of the human condition, mind, body, and spirit. So there are three groups of Numanity: The Minds of North Point, The Hands of SouthWest Point, and The Souls of SouthEast point. As far as other colonies in the solar system go, the number of points on the star structures of Tetra, Penta, Hexa, Septa, Nona, and Decaskelia increase according to their distance from the sun, and founder effects leading to decreased genetic variation mean transport between colonies is forbidden. We come in at a point where Numanity has built a machine that can harvest energy from the sun, but is on the 23rd attempt of installation. Sofia is a programmer (the hero) and the story follows her and the characters lives she is connected to, after her ex who didn't want kids dies she gets left a fuck ton of money and her eggs (in the future in vitro gametogenesis is possible) and she eventually decides to have a baby (Nora) -this baby grows a structure on her brain that allows her to learn incredibly fast, 

i might never be a mind 
but i don’t know what i won’t find 
if i don’t try 

dt know what i am 
but  i know it’s not a man 
would rather die at their hands 
than conform to their plan

this land will crystallise 
with me trapped deep inside 
i know i must fight i know i’m strong enough not to hide 

so i’ll learn what i can
