If you don’t react to your thoughts, you won’t react to people. 
If you don’t react to your inner sensations, you won’t react to life situations. 
If you stop reacting to your damaging behaviours, they will lose their grip and fall away. 
If you learn to observe without projection into that which you observe, you can never overreact. 
Things are not happening *to* you, they are merely happening.
Things cannot be taken from you, they do not belong to you. 
Your own power has created the reality you are experiencing right now. 
Wanting is the only thing in the way of receiving.
True knowing is unutterable, and immediately attainable.

Resisting pain worsens pain, which worsens resistance 
Become an invincible creature playing dead in the unforgiving jaws of the world 
Let suffering tire its limbs thrashing you
Let ignorance wear its teeth down on your neck 
Do not try to fight back against your turmoil 
Break the cycle of warfare your body is housing 
Lay down all weapons, die to the enemy - pain.
Pain will always win, so let it. Meet it with gratitude. 
And in doing so take all of its power away
