<span style="color:#000ff;">Getting to sleep at 7am</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Because nothing to wake up for</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Is a good thing</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">I have curtains</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Green is for go</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Horizontal go</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">Whispering</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Disgusting things</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Sweet and sticky [this is fucked up]</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">forgot you were even there</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Forgot I was even me</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">My brain on paternity leave</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">Umbilical cord transferring data</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">Into hungry ears</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">and turn on the light</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">I wish I could reach inside this tiny life machine and pull something real out [sounds of birth]</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">Like the heart that was beating in my throat</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">it was beating it was making my breath a drum</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">I Just want the things they want but i don't know the things they do Your eyes might have said it all if I could have looked at you</span>
