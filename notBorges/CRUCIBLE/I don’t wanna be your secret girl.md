I don’t wanna be your secret girl 
Ive taken enough loads and had it with your slurs 
I don’t wanna be your secret whore
I can’t hold up these four walls anymore 

You’re on TV 
Don’t look at me 




# HE PUSHED ALL MY FLOWERS
# INTO EARLY GRAVES 
# BUT THAT NEVER STOPPED ME 
# TAKING WHAT HE GAVE

# I ATE ALL THE BABIES
# GROWING FROM MY EYES  
# SAPPED OF ALL THEIR POWER
# NEVER WILL THEY RISE 



# I PUSHED ALL THE FLOWERS 
# INTO EARLY GRAVES 
# AND NOW THERE THEY SETTLE 
# IN WITH ALL HIS SHAME
