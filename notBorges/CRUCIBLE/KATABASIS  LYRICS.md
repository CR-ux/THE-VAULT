(1) ALL MY FLOWERS 

HE PUSHED ALL MY FLOWERS
INTO EARLY GRAVES 
BUT THAT NEVER STOPPED ME 
TAKING WHAT HE GAVE

I ATE ALL THE INSECTS
HATCHING FROM MY EYES  
SAPPED OF ALL THEIR POWER
NEVER WILL THEY RISE 
    

I PUSHED ALL MY FLOWERS 
INTO EARLY GRAVES 
AND NOW THERE THEY SETTLE 
IN WITH ALL HIS SHAME 


(2) THE WATER OF LETHE 

SIR, SIR, YOU CAN’T BE BLEEDING SIR 
YOU CAN’T BE BLEEDING, CAN’T BE BLEEDING SIR 
SO OPEN TO US YOUR TREASURE 
YOUR FRANKINCENSE YOUR 
FRANKENSTEIN SENSOR 
YOUR FRANKINCENSE YOUR FRANKENSTEIN SENSE AND MHYRR 
YOU CAN’T BE BLEEDING, CAN’T BE BLEEDING SIR 
DRINK FROM THE RIVER, FORGET WHAT’S BEEN DONE 
BE READY TO PART WITH THE COIN ON YOUR TONGUE 
DRINK FROM THE RIVER FORGET HOW TO SING 
THERE STANDS THE ELM FROM WHICH ALL YOUR FALSE DREAMS CLING 
DRINK FROM THE RIVER, FORGET 


(3) THE FALL OF ICARUS 

OH, THIS DISGUSTING TRUTH 
FOUR WALLS TO HANG A ROOF 
OVER MY WEARY HEAD 
KNIGHT 
OF 
THE LIVING DEAD 
WASHED UP TO WETTER SHORES 
ATHENA OF THE NORTH 
TISSUE TO DRY YOUR MOUTH 
FISHER OF THE SOUTH 

ICARUS GOT NOTHING ON US NOW 
ICARUS (GOT NOTHING)
ICARUS (GOT NOTHING ON US)
ICARUS GOT NOTHING ON US NOW 
GOT NOTHING 
NOW

(4) BEHOLD THIS SACRED STAIN 

LIE, TERRIFIED 
OF WHAT JUST MIGHT 
HAPPEN TONIGHT 
COME PARADISE 
PARTS LEFT BEHIND 
I DON’T MIND 
ALL OF MY DAYS 
TURN INTO NIGHTS 
I DIDN’T DIE 
(AT LEAST THIS TIME)
CLOSING MY EYES 
OPEN MY THIGHS 
I’LL GET THIS STAIN 
I’LL GET THIS STAIN OUT 
WHEN IT DRIES 
WHEN IT DRIES 

[The Providence Hymn]:

I am the Providence of everything.
I became like my own human children. 
I existed from the first.
I walked down every possible road. 
I am the wealth of the light.
I am the remembering of the fullness. 
I walked into the place of greatest darkness and on down.
I entered the central part of the prison. 
The foundations of chaos quaked! 
I hid because of their evil.
            They did not recognize me.  
I came down a second time
            continuing on
I emerged from among those of light
I AM!
 THE REMEMBERING!
OF PROVIDENCE!
I entered the middle of darkness,
            The inner part of the underworld
            To pursue my mission
The foundations of chaos quaked!
           THREATENING TO COLLAPSE UPON ALL WHO WERE THERE AND UTTERLY DESTROY THEM!
I SOARED UPWARD AGAIN
            To my roots in THE LIGHT!
            So as not to destroy them all yet. 
I DESCENDED A THIRD TIME!
I am LIGHT!
I am DWELLING IN LIGHT!
I AM THE REMEMBERING OF PROVIDENCE!
I entered the MIDST OF DARKNESS!
I came to the DEEPEST PART OF THE UNDERWORLD!
I LET MY FACE LIGHT UP!
            Thinking of the end of their time -
I ENTERED 
THEIR PRISON 
THE! 
BODY!
IS!
THAT!
PRISON!


(5) YOUR WORD IS MY BOND 

TWENTY POUNDS TO PLACE HIS FLESH 
IN RIPPLES OF ABUNDANCE 
O’ER HER BREAST TO TEACH HER INDEPENDENCE 
THE AUTONOMY OF NERVES AND NERVOUSNESS 
‘NEATH THE CUSHION, ‘NEATH THE MATTRESS 
SHACKLES THAT HE TACKLES WITH 
SIN
SIN
SIN
TO PLACE UPON 
HIS THROAT A KNIFE 
A MAN OF GRATING APPETITE 
TO PLACE UPON
HIS THROAT A KNIFE 
A MAN OF GRATING
APPETITE 
AND AS MY RIGHT HAND MADE HIM TREMBLE 
I DISMEMBERED 
IT FROM ME 
FAR BETTER TO LOSE JUST ONE PART 
THAN FEEL THE WEIGHING OF MY BODY 
DESCENDING THROUGH SALIVA STAINS 
AND THROUGH SEAMEN SHIPWRECKED ON THE ROCKS 
AND VELCRO FASTENED PULLING HAIR FROM OUT OF WRINKLED LIVER SPOTS
AND VELCRO FASTENED PULLING HAIR FROM OUT OF WRINKLED LIVER SPOTS
AND VELCRO FASTENED PULLING HAIR FROM OUT OF WRINKLED LIVER SPOTS
I 
DEVOUR
THE AFFLICTED 
FROM THE EARTH 
AND THE NEEDY 
FROM AMONG MEN 


(6) TARTARUS 

I BEAT THE SICKNESS OF THE WORLD 
WITH MY DRUM 
I HOLD THE ILLNESS OF THE WORLD 
IN MY DRUM 
BEHOLD THE SICKNESS OF THE WORLD 
I AM THE SICKNESS OF THE WORLD 
ONCE FAGGOT 
TWICE ANANSI 
GIRL 
YOU MY DEAR CHILD 
ARE MY WEAPONS 
AND MY SHAME ECLIPSES YOURS 
NOW TAKE YOUR INVINCIBLE SHAFTS 
AND DRINK THE WATER FROM MY GOURD 
AND SHOOT THOSE SWIFT FLYING ARROWS 
INTO THE WRETCHED HEART OF GOD 
A THIRD OF THE WORLD IS AT STAKE 
MY SHAME IT WILL 
SWADDLE YOURS 

MOTHER BLIGHTING FRUITS OF EARTH 
OPENED HERSELF UP TO AFFORD 
A WAY CONVEYED THROUGH BOTTOMMOST CAVES 
WITH A CLEW OF UMBILICAL CORD 
CONSORT SUPREME TO THE SOVEREIGN LORD 
IN THE DWELLING OF THE MINOTAUR
IN THE CENTRE OF MY GREATEST SHAME 
I AM GIVING  BIRTH TO ALL OF YOURS 
IN THE CENTRE OF MY GREATEST SHAME 
I AM GIVING  BIRTH TO ALL OF YOURS 
IN THE CENTRE OF MY GREATEST SHAME 
I AM GIVING  BIRTH TO ALL OF YOURS 
I AM GIVING  BIRTH TO ALL OF YOURS 

VERILY I BUILD SUCH FRAIL HOUSES
MERRILY I ATE THE CRIMSON POMEGRANATE FRUIT 
JEALOUSLY I ATE THE SEVEN SEEDS AND THEY TOOK ROOT 
MY FRIEND COCKROACH’S MACHETE 
SLASHED IN HALF MY SUIT

Verily I build 
such frail houses 

I BEAT THE SICKNESS OF THE WORLD
(WE ARE THE SICKNESS OF THE WORLD) 
WITH MY DRUM 
I HOLD THE ILLNESS OF THE WORLD 
(WE ARE THE ILLNESS OF THE WORLD)
IN MY DRUM 
BEHOLD THE SICKNESS OF THE WORLD 
(WE HOLD THE SICKNESS OF THE WORLD)
BEHOLD THE SICKNESS OF THE WORLD 
(WE ARE THE SICKNESS OF THE WORLD)
IN MY 
DRUM

(7) LATRODECTUS LAZARUS 

MY ART IS A SICKNESS 
HEART A MADNESS 
AN EMPTY AND CRACKED BOWL OF A DREAM 
AND THE ARTIFICE OF A TIGHT SQUEEZE 
AS IF SOMEHOW SOMEONE MIGHT BE 
HOLDING IN MY MESENTERY 
AND KEEPING ALL MY ORGANS IN 
I LIVE AS A WINDOW 
A WINDOW INTO OTHERS’ LIVES 
TEACHING THEM ALL LESSONS 
THEM LESSONS ABOUT LIGHT 
AND HOW IT TOUCHES 
EVERY DISGUSTING THING 
GOD I AM HUNGRY 
AND PRAYING TO BE REMEMBERED 
MY FACE CONTAINED IN SILVER CLOCHE 
AND I AM PRAYING NOT TO BE FORGOT 
I LIVE AS A WIDOW:
BEING -
A FICKLE AND SO PRICKLY 
THING
HINGEING ON A SWINGING DOOR 
A HALL OF MIRRORS I ABHOR 
AND WHAT’S MORE 
TRUST, BUT DISEASE ENCRUSTED 
ANXIETY RUSTED IN FALLACIOUS APATHY 
AND WHITTLED BY CHISELS 
INTO VISAGES OF FEMININITY 
TO CAPTURE MEN AS WINGED STATUES 
QUIVERING ON DEWY ROPES 
I PULL FROM OUT OF ME 
STRINGS OF VIOLINS 
A CELLO AND A DOUBLE BASS 
AND THE WEB OF DIRGES DANCE 
IN THE MANDIBLES OF SILENCE 

I DEVOUR 
MY LOVE 
AND WONDER WHERE IT’S GONE 

I DEVOUR 
MY
LOVE
AND 
WONDER
WHERE
IT’S
GONE
