**heavy heart is still a heart**
**heart is heavy still**
**heavy heart**
**still -**
**clasps a beat**
**the show has been postponed**
**the crops cropped**
**burned in a furnace**
**the world is hurting**
**like i used to**

**the show has been postponed**
**the world is hurting us**
**like we’ve used it**
**chewing up our gums,** 
**bland**
**stripped by saliva**
**come March the world** 
**might be healing**
**for us to march upon Her**
**(again)**
**polarity pulls a cloth**
**unveils a mirror**
**and collapses on itself**
**chiasmic plasma**
**gurgling**
**and every little life**
**gets deeper while**
**the living is postponed**
**(again)**
**i reprimand the child i was**
**who asked for nothing but alone time**
**meeting her at the door**
**ruler slaps on wrist**
**i hold her spirit**
**nipples on fire**
**clasping at something**
**to burn**
**to ruin**
**dust**
**to dust**
**and death has been postponed**
**(again)**

**and knowing of the circles**
**encircling our hell**
**(entry has a waiting list)**
**building structures deep within it**
**impenetrable quiet**
**around which**
**threnodies are sighing**
**creaking reeds in a breeze**
**and our breath, laboured**
**gets delayed**
**(again)**

**and falling, ever falling**
**into broken arms they jutted**
**bone exposed as a winter branch**
**(the show postponed until the spring)**
**and the little boys like I wasn't**
**pissed into a trough standing up**
**their cotton shorts dead at their ankles**
**given place to soak it all in**
**and behind a flimsy door** 
**and flimsy makeshift walls** 
**of womanhood**
**the isolation of my cubicle**
**(again)**

**knuckles pop my knelling toll**
**and charon braids my hair**
**drowning in our oxygen**
**while we wait for tides to take us there**
**to me, to friends and family**
**to a time that’s been pushed back**
**(again)**

**our home is made of matches**
**and strikes of clocks and faces**
**almond slices, cyanide**
**bitterness so beautiful**
**here i am again**
**collapsed into my mirror**
**annihilated harmony**
**where no harm can come to me**
**my world can't be postponed**
**(again)**

**postponed, i am**
**able to stand**
**it no longer**
**tucks itself into my bed at night**
**nibbling on my earlobe**
**whispering promises of future**
**when skin can kiss the skin**
**(again)**

**all the wrongest things unravel**
**sickly sickle stuck in skin**
**sucking trickling sticky substance**
**from the deepest pits within**
**every touch puts us in debt**
**caresses are postponed**
**(again)**

**what a silly little thing**
**to be turned inside out about**
**the deck it buckles**
**under wait**
**self immolates**
**enlightens my excuse for dinner**
**a broken desk for a dinner table**
**a piano for a date**
**at least a decade late**
**and still, i**
**weight**
**no choice but to postpone**
**(again)**
