The trains next stop is Khopi which is on the coast, lots of Cornish looking buildings and contains the circling track adjacent to the big lighthouse. Inside the tower of the lighthouse is a futuristic helpdesk and lots of staff in the reception area. The lighthouse is on the north side of the beach. The beach is long and the waves are constant, there is a wall behind the beach, the road is atop the wall on a higher level and winds upwards to the mountain where there is a villa that resembles auntie sue’s and one can see the view of all of Khopi when swimming in the pool. The next stop takes a while to get to as it’s further away and is called Tyxos. It contains multiple theme parks and rollercoasters all interconnected into a huge area. I have ridden the drop tower, the thing that looks like stealth, the thing that looks like a dark red nemesis (inspired by nemesis inferno), a huge huge HUGE red and yellow rollercoaster that goes exceedingly high and winds around in a complex pattern. I have also ridden a symmetrical rollercoaster with someone I can’t remember, climbing up a staircase of track and then down the other side. There is also a purple and green rollercoaster I have ridden there which doesn’t resemble anything in real life. It has a purple fence around it but the queue line goes through the tracks. There was one ride I rode that was sort of like a ghost train but went very far underground and was very scary and complicated. In the water park section I have ridden many slides but one that comes to mind in particular is a series of slides connected by pools, and you can make decisions as to which route down the network of slides you will take. I met interesting people at the interface pools. I also remember the rapids which come out of the giant vivarium dome like center parcs-the dome itself is much larger than CP and once I think I jumped from a platform at the apex all the way into a pool underneath. In the theme park area there is a walk through maze that’s quite scary 
Wjuht is harder to get to, the train doesn’t run there. You are taken there without choice when you least expect it. 

Aoa-he is where the giant elevator is, and my fear of heights are most often realised in some way

Hallucinations that show the real world 
Meeting s with planet la to reveal this guy
April receives glegory
House after hospital 
The House I’ve been to before only in dreams 
Resembles abercorn but really isn’t 
There was a big area 

It’s another world that contains the abercorn husk
I’ve been waiting for a bus regularly 
It feels like London in some places, Sofia in others, Edinburgh in others, 
The train pulled into the station once and I was waiting on the actual track a few hundred meters away 
The track goes underground deep
There is always some Jealously going on 

Once I did it with [[notBorges/redacted]] 
This Dream i did it withnsonebody [[notBorges/redacted]] slept with maybe his boyfriend 
The energy came from [[notBorges/redacted]] in the other room 
And I heard them talking about me 
[[notBorges/redacted]] is usually there
