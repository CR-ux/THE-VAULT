<span style="color:#000ff;">mum was the one who always made sure there was pesto</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">you think you know me but you don't know me at all</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">i thought i didn't know me but i spend more time with myself than with anyone</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">so i must have got to know myself pretty fucking well</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">it's just hazy</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">and you'd hate me if you knew i was the source of that lingering scent</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">i wish i could reach at the air and pull away what's making you absent</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">look at me not the fucking TV</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">can't you see i've been breaking so badly</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">just thinking about how things were before probably</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">but the problem is sometimes people have no chemistry</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">just acidity</span> 

<span style="color:#000ff;">won't clean my room</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">it's not really mine anymore</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">collections of souvenirs of before</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">to make an after photo to abhor</span>

<span style="color:#000ff;">living here is free</span>
<span style="color:#000ff;">but not me</span> 
<span style="color:#000ff;">and i'm not living</span>
