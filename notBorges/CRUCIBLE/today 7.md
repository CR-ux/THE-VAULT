dear diary, 

**FYI: PART ONE OF A VERY LONG UPDATE FOLLOWS AFTER THE LYRICS/DESCRIPTION OF THIS NEW TRACK YOU CAN STREAM ABOVE.**

hi hello it's me. I'm sorry it's been so long since I've posted on here. Life has been so intense and busy!

The audio uploaded above is a new piece I have made for my partner about our love and their pet rats. It was their birthday yesterday and Iâ€™ve been working on it for the last few months. Iâ€™m very glad the process is over, because making something for someone I love so much oftentimes gives me a really unattainable sense of perfectionism (even more than normal). But Iâ€™m very happy with the master and the extension of the KATABASIS aesthetic into something a bit more hopeful and full of light. 

It starts with a poem I wrote for them when they were crying about Ernie struggling out of their hand onto the floor; the clarinet by Jem and the accordion were recorded in Barnieâ€™s house when they were away and I was housesitting for them. It includes plenty of little samples of them talking to their rats, and ends with the audio from a video they sent me right when we started dating, showing me a little pamphlet theyâ€™d printed called â€˜hello I miss youâ€™. 

Lyrics: 

[you didn't drop me] 
Inside your dressing gown 
I count the hairs on your arm
Far fewer than mine 
(A smoothness I could never know)
And Iâ€™ve never had this much room before 

Ungroomed, unkempt, dishevelled 
You trimmed my claws in your bed 
I know no love is like another 
(And I will never be my brother)

I know your smell so well by now 
It keeps me up at night 
When I am down and out
And you move about me, lovingly
Make allowances for all my messes 
Dampening noises I try not to make 

And falling, 
It was easy - 
All I ever had to do 
was struggle 
You didnâ€™t 
Drop me 
(I know how that should feel by now)

And out, away, from the safety of your hand 
It was only my own gravity
Holding on to me then 

And it could have never been your fault 
Iâ€™ve never had this much room before 
(I promise you, this isnâ€™t blood)

I told myself I needed more -

In the rattled cage of morning 
(Knowing not what I had asked for)
I fell, now pulleyed by the sun 
Reaching with my growing claws
At the lesser, empty freedom 
Iâ€™d known so many times before
The nails and grain in wooden boards
Of the sprawling wide and open floor 

take your 
shoes off 
come in 
side 
you don't 
have to 
hide 
any 
more 

I've been 
loving 
you 
from inside 
a cardboard box 

I've been 
loving 
you
with all the
things 
just out of reach 
of my touch 

you don't
have to 
hide anymore 

you laid me 
down 
in your big bed 

you laid me down
kissed me on my head 

you laid me down
kissed me on my head

you laid me down in your big bed 

you told me 

you loved me

so this made deeper 

tears flow when

you laid me down in your big bed 

I fell, quiet 

for the first time 

I fell, quiet 

(in my mind)

SO. Since the last time we spoke, I have organised a multidisciplinary festival across Glasgow and Edinburgh, played SIX more live KATABASIS sets, performed in a full fringe run AND caught scarlet fever of all things. (Iâ€™m so goth I catch victorian diseases, apparently) 

All of this is quite a lot to write about and I donâ€™t want to bombard your feeds with multiple separate posts, so Iâ€™m going to try, against every naturally chaotic fibre of my being, to recount these experiences/show some photographic documentation in a chronological, *organised* and efficient fashionâ€¦ Good luck with that Callie(!)

Iâ€™m going to split the writing into (probably) three separate posts to give you all time to absorb. 

1. AYE FESTIVAL 
2. KATABASIS AT STAGEHD
3. KATABASIS AT ANNUALE
4. KATABASIS AT SUMMERHALL (x2)
5. SHE/HER - FRINGE SHOW
6. KATABASIS AT GAFF

7. The Aye Festival (Spit It Out) 

OFFCUT

During the Aye Festival, which was funded by Creative Scotland after over a year of hard work grant writing, we (Spit It Out) put on a really exciting programme of events across both Glasgow and Edinburgh. Workshops, live performances, exhibitions, it was a beautiful constellation of creativity in June, happening JUST as Iâ€™d moved to Glasgow - Iâ€™d barely even got my bearings before I needed to get stuck into the hustle and bustle of the festival. 
I curated OFFCUT at Banshee Labyrinth; an all-trans* lineup of noisy/abrasive artists, featuring myself, Lisa the Beauty Queen and Maniatrix. I was so humbled and honoured to be playing alongside these beautiful friends and contemporaries of mine. It was a dark sweaty and grungey sort of affair, that was INCREDIBLY difficult to pull off, considering the stuffy nature of Edinburgh Council (just one of the reasons I have moved to Glasgow) 


IF ONLY HANDS COULD SPEAK 

The gallery debut of my live art practice was one of the most pivotal experiences of my life. I couldnâ€™t even tell you whether it was positive or negative, just that it was incredibly important for me to go through. 
The exhibition my piece was performed as part of was called â€˜ONE OF THEMâ€™ - an exploration of abuse and trauma, peering through a lens of transformative justice. 
Photographs and audio testimonies of people who had experienced sexual trauma were taken, and for this part of the installation, it was my responsibility to transcribe the audio testimonies into the written word. 
Every word spoken about their experiences burned into my soul. I didnâ€™t realise just how triggering the experience would be, until halfway through the last testimony, which uncovered a traumatic memory about my own past, and shed a harsh, fluorescent, unforgiving light onto the fact that I too am a sexual trauma survivor. 
This was a mere two hours before my performance in the middle of the space was to begin. 
The piece I created, â€˜IF ONLY HANDS COULD SPEAKâ€™, was a live art installation performed alongside my orchestral noise EP â€˜ARCHITECT OF MY ABUSE: this chapel you built must surely collapseâ€™. 
The piece drew from Ovidâ€™s metamorphoses, specifically the story of Philomela, a talented weaver who was raped by a Thracian king, who cut out her tongue after the act to prevent her from speaking about it. 
In the myth, Philomela weaves a tapestry depicting the horrendous trauma, thereby using creative self-expression to break free of the shackles of censorship placed upon her by her oppressor. 
I felt this story was the ultimate archetype for so many peopleâ€™s experience with sexual trauma and rape. 

The piece, lasting approximately 13 minutes, involved strobe lighting illuminating a white sheet as I gyrated beneath it, me staging the severance of my own tongue (using a prosthetic and plenty of fake blood), bleeding onto the plain, untouched sheet, before painting an abstract form all over it with every part of my almost naked body. 

Once the painting was complete, I tore off a strip of the fabric, tied it around my mouth as a gag. I dragged the sheet around the wooden chest placed in the centre of the room. I lit the candle on top of it, and I held the sheet, bundled like a baby in my arms, as I screamed as loud as I could. 

I took the sheet and placed it inside the chest, closing it shut as the abrasive noise filling the gallery filtered out into a breathy silence. 



1. STAGEHD FESTIVAL 

I was asked to perform the full album at the StagEHd Festival at the Ross Band Stand in Princes Street Gardens. This was a venue Iâ€™d dreamt of playing since I moved to Edinburgh, and it was quite discombobulating to perform KATABASIS in broad daylight. 
Right at the crescendo of track 5 (my proudest moment of the album), when I jumped off the stage onto the floor below, the rain started, and yet again the work seemed to take on this mystical, shamanic quality that felt way bigger than me.
Iâ€™ve merged all the videos that Barnie took (bless them, they recorded basically the whole thing) and uploaded them as a private link on YouTube for you all to watch.
