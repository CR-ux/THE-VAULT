permalink: How I slept
---
Let me tell you how I slept 
Surrounded by the things I kept 
Lying with me in my bed 
Let me tell you how I slept 

In an empty artless space 
Artificial light dressed face 
Dreams of things I have replaced 
Let me tell you 

Let me tell you how I slept 
Barely at all, yet more debt 
Late as ever, got no rest 


Let me tell you how I slept 
Alone and with my clothes on
