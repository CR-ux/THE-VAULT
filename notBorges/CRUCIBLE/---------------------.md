Dear J.Suspended

I
so 
tonic 

Dear J.S.
I am moronic 

(
pills keep me company 

like a stupid magnet 
inside an iron box

WILL YOU TELL ME WHAT I AM 
WILL YOU TELL ME WHAT TO DO 
EVERY SECOND I AM LIVING 

I need you 
TELL ME WHAT TO FEEL 
WON’T YOU ASK ME NOT TO 
Get better 

(My heart is yours with a side of sauerkraut 
I want you to 
want me to 
take it too far
I lied about growing out of my
misgiving)

pulling up my genes 
every four fucking steps   
                         no bra to fix me
on my way to 
having it aborted 

the flood was pathetic 
phallic
seeing no fog
it had lifted 
and clattering reality turned its head 
my own crow looked at me
i still wanted to bleed

(Did you have to salt the clot so nothing would ever grow there again?)

   i was given the pain i had been asking for since i was born

Dear J.Semen
colonic 

pills keep me hostage 

(MY BRAIN CONTAINS OVER 70 SUBSTANCES KNOWN TO CAUSE HARM TO HUMAN HEALTH
YOUR BRAIN KILLS 
QUIT NOW or forever hold your peace) 
  
WHAT HAPPENED 
to make you this way 
god couldn’t make me happy so instead She made me gay

i will make my rapist lose his erection
          I have a right to call that rejection
what is it about this city?
Dear J.Sanctuary 

i’m your pretty pretty delusional girl

(it was written:
“Don't laugh
At my 
Togetherness 
I'm 
A force to be reckoned with 
Just don't know where to focus”)

Coz they were so hurt 
when I touched them with dirty hands
they came out
I don't want to be gross to kiss when I come home 
But I hope you know you could have boils and pustules all over your body and face and I would still want to kiss you more than anyone else in the whole goddamn world
