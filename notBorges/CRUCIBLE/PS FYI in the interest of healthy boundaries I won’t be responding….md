PS FYI in the interest of healthy boundaries I wonâ€™t be responding to any probing Qs abt these surgeries anymore, itâ€™s got a bit too intense and dehumanising. I care deeply about my trans peers but I must also care about me. yes it is CRUCIAL esp now in the insidiously transphobic UK to educate about trans health but this education shouldnâ€™t be coming from me; an artist whoâ€™s work/existence is politicised bc she also happens to be trans (sis google or try books theyâ€™re c*nty)! this time is about resting & thinking about my own needs for once. everything you see on my socials from now on is for my own entertainment, embodiment of intention, & enjoyment. Iâ€™m an exhumed ex-exhibitionist over this prying gaze not accompanied by any real support/showing up: cis voyeurism (I coined that term cite ur sauces). I hereby call back all my energies of self sacrifice, fear or guilt about my own v deserved fulfilment, in order to be present, actually live MY life, let my art/body/environment bloom into their next divine iterations and be well, balanced and get strong fiercelyðŸ«°fiercelyðŸ«°FIERCELYðŸ«° (sheâ€™s out of her vulnerability martyrdom era) thank youuu
