TRACK 1:
- [ ] Work on piano

TRACK 2:
- [ ] Habitual stains could be a little clearer maybe 
- [ ] “The stain” high harmony at 3:56
- [ ] “DRI-nk from” AT 4:00
- [ ] 5:13 harmonies could come out more 
- [ ] Start of ascending section strings quite abrupt 5:50
- [ ] Loud lead Vox at 5:44 should come down to hear harmonies
