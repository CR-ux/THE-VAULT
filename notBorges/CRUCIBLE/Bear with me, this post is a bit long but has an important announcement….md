<span style="color:#000ff;">I don't want you to think I'm saying "it's all been done before" or "creation = imitation" because no no no no NO. There are infinite artistic possibilities and (i personally think) artists can only teach the world something by being honest, being unique (which happens thankfully by nature!) and by provoking thought and discussion. The very act of choosing influences, of having experiences, of desiring things, makes the art YOURS, it is a manifestation of your own self, which can be pretty scary and exposing. But also fucking brilliant. What I am trying to say, luckily without the character limit of twitter, is that artists are connected and united by their art, and what I would really love to do is create an artist collective (a group of artists working together to make content and share experience and advice) on the Internet, with some of the wonderful artists I have been lucky enough to meet in my 20 years on earth so far. I'm hoping that this will take the form of a blog, with different artists/writers/musicians/photographers/poets/taxidermists/ posting their work, podcasts discussing various arty things, videos, musical collabs, ALL THINGS ART! I've realised that art doesn't have to be lonely, it can be a harmonious dysfunctional family.</span>
