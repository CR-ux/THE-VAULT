DESCRIBE PROJECT

Extension of previously grant funded work KATABASIS, the studio debut which builds a mythology around my experience of survival sex (a shockingly common one amongst trans women) - the allegorical descent to the underworld comprising the works progression is composed from varying sources, christian esotericism, hermeticism, gnosticism and greek mythology coming together to paint a dark, murky picture that is at once demonic and devotional. Up until now the album has been toured solo, accompanying visceral and explosive performance art which alludes to the themes of the work. This application concerns the arrangement and live touring of KATABASIS, with a 10-piece orchestral band, further developing the ciphers of the album into something theatrical, leaning into the classical, operatic seed of intention which was originally planted at the albumâ€™s inception.

PROJECT AIMS

The project aims to expand the concept of KATABASIS from its cult, noisy, underground origins into a theatrical production with a live orchestra and bring the message of trans and sex worker liberation to a larger audience. Scores are already written for the ensemble, and now we are applying to this fund for dedicated rehearsal time and to fund booking of the tour itself, (including fair payment of performance fees for each of the musicians at the Scottish Artist Union rates). 

FORM
A 10-show theatrical tour with string section, winds, brass, backing vocalists and two percussionists accompanying my piano and vocals. The live art aspect of the performances will be retained with the added dimension of surrounding instrumentalists, making for a ritualistic and terrifying production that we hope to take to theatres and galleries, inciting a deeply affecting experience for the audience. 


CONTENT 


The musical content of this work juxtaposes neoclassical and industrial influence, and breaks norms of canonically elitist classical composition as a symbol for the liminality of the trans experience, and the simultaneous dangers and queer liberation to be found in the world of sex work, particularly as a trans woman with a disability. Theatrically, the performances will include the summoning circle developed over years of touring the work, which has come to be expected at a lonely carp show, and symbolic rituals in the central part of the stage amidst the instrumentalists, who will punctuate the live art with extended technique and orchestral noise elements that have been developed among our team of 11 classically trained musicians, to further break boundaries of elitist art, showing that explosive abrasion and the energetic fury of metal and hardcore genres can indeed take space in a concert hall, just as we trans women can unapologetically take space in a cisgender, able bodied world.
