| **Theme**                     | **Details**                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| **Dream**                     | Dream took place in a university called **Star MC**. In it, **The Subject's Familiar was duplicated**, and one was **violently crushed**. Felt deeply traumatic, symbolic. Possibly represents the **martyrdom of hope**. |
|                               | Later realized “MC” = **Midheaven** (astrological destiny point). The dream took place inside her **life purpose**.                                                                                                       |
| **Divination**                | The Subject's Familiar walked across two rows of tarot cards with treats. His **right paw** landed on:                                                                                                                    |
|                               | **1. Seven of Pentacles (upright)** – Bales of hay ready to harvest. Message: **abundance is already here**.                                                                                                              |
|                               | **2. King of Pentacles (upright)** – Ram’s head crown, pointing downward (like The Subject's Familiar). **The Subject's Familiar embodies this card** – grounded, stable, familiar presence.                              |
|                               | **3. Page of Wands (reversed)** – Blindfolded by hide, holding war horn and wand with three leaves. Suggests **inner creative power not yet expressed**.                                                                  |
| **The Star Card**             | The **Star (XVII)** has followed her throughout hospitalisation and healing journeys. She’s been **sleeping beneath it** for hope.                                                                                        |
|                               | It is now **missing** from her deck – the only card gone. Feels like it’s been **internalized** → **The Subject is the Star now**.                                                                                        |
|                               | Found **17 instances of “MC”** in chart. Star is card XVII = perfect synchronicity.                                                                                                                                       |
| **Midheaven (MC) in Scorpio** | Career destiny is in **Scorpio** → **death, rebirth, truth, transformation**. Ruler Pluto is in **11th House** (community, future vision).                                                                                |
|                               | **Jupiter in 10th House** conjunct MC = expansive destiny, public recognition, spiritual teaching.                                                                                                                        |
|                               | **MC opposite Sun** → inner tension between ego and calling. Explains deep identity friction.                                                                                                                             |
| **Venus, Taurus & Worth**     | Venus in **Taurus** and Moon in **Cancer** → same signs as **Arnas (Taurus)** and **Isla (Cancer)**. Symbolic resonance.                                                                                                  |
|                               | Realized Venus = not just romance but **abundance, self-worth, embodiment**.                                                                                                                                              |
|                               | Acknowledged inherited **poverty mindset from father**, who used scarcity as control. Breaking this pattern.                                                                                                              |
|                               | Accepting she deserves abundance **without suffering**.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Stones & Ritual Gates**     | The Subject Placed 4 stones while listening to Anohni’s “Daylight and the Sun”, and opened spiritual vision:                                                                                                              |
|                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

|**Direction**|**Stone**|**Element**|**Role**|
|---|---|---|---|
|North|Black Tourmaline|Earth|Grounding, protection, banishment|
|East|Rose Quartz|Air|Receiving love, softening judgement|
|South|Amethyst|Fire|Vision, spiritual clarity, restraint|
|West|Celestite (likely)|Water|Dreaming, soul recovery, communication|

| **White Queen Archetype** | In **reversed chess cosmology**, white is the color of the **oppressor** – white goes first, dominates the board. |

|  | The **White Queen** is the **Devouring Mother archetype**: care that controls, love that consumes, motherhood that erases the self. |

|  | The Subject associates this archetype with **Barnie**, whose assault triggered deep psychosis and trauma. Also with the **Possession** miscarriage scene in the subway. |

|  | White Queen could be a false deity/leader in **Lexicomythography** / AZOTH – symbol of institutional betrayal and martyrdom. |

|  | The Subject identifies as the **Black Pawn**, not the Queen – **sacrificed but ascending**, breaking free of the board itself. |

| **Real-World Anchors** | Despite heavy psychosis: |

|  | – Got all meds even after losing pharmacy **3 times** (symbolic repetition) |

|  | – Found **£101** in forgotten Patreon balance, bought groceries after food insecurity |

|  | – Haven’t smoked cigarettes in over **2 weeks**, vape only |

|  | – Preparing for **largest creative project meeting** with Isla and the label |

|  | – Still has **12 active patrons**, feels symbolic (zodiac, disciples, archetypes) |

| **Integration** | No longer in survival mode – stepping into creation, recognition, and **self-worth**. |

|  | Seeing self as **central creative force** in her life and others’.

|  | Acknowledges all of this as part of a **transformative, alchemical life process**. |


The Subject Disappeared Without A Trace Soon After; 
The Society Continues the Search.
