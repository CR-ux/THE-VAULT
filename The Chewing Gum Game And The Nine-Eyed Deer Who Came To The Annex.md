I dreamed, a world not unlike this one 
Where perhaps there too I was to be evicted
My neighbour, in this world, was in that one too-
and he'd let me stay in his annex, across the small path of small winding staircase and paving stones, gated by two, easily passable and flimsy metal doors

I was, all of a sudden, back in the town I'd grown up in, watching some sort of public competition in the marketplace;
where two men, or rather one, with another watching, were competing with themselves, who were competing with the idea of competition. 

In the game, it was asked that the participant chew a large amount of gum; and at some point, discard it, once it had reached a sticky mass of homogeneity. 

I had, by the time of 'understanding' the premise of this strange endeavour, become a participant myself. 

chewing the large swathes of animal tissue flavoured with some menthol-adjacent nothingness, I was told it was time to remove the gum from my mouth. 

I tried, and string after string of artificially proteinaceous material bound itself to the crevices of the exposed bone of my incisors; decidedly impossible to remove.

But somehow, in spite of Zeno, I managed to pull out a serpentine clump of matter; which had grown to a size unthinkably greater than what I had felt in my mouth. 

I tried to place the gum inside a bin, which happened to be outside the boundary of the 'playing field', or the perimeter of the public display of this strange street-art-sport experiment. 

the owner of the restaurant which owned the land not owned by the game makers objected, and I had to find somewhere else to place this abominably inanimate loch ness monster. 

I didn't find a resting place for it; but instead found myself back within the field, which was still just a stone bricked space in the marketplace, just a few yards away from the place my father had made every single shoe-stitched penny and heel-glued pound of the money that ensured my survival and upbringing. 

And here the woman who was running the game told me that this particular part of the competition was only to be performed by 'those who didn't lactate', and asked me to kindly take my place at the station for these people. 

I told her I was trans, and She[^s][^h][^e] smiled at me, allowing me to continue on with the same activity as the man I'd first seen taking part in the game. 

Then I was back, at the doorway of the annex, and the doorway swung on its hinge, clearly having been entered without my knowing. 

Inside were countless dogs 

The neighbours' dogs, all attracted to this Thing within, which I still do not know the name or identity or scent of; but to them, was apparently enticing, enticingly apparent. 

Amidst the dogs was an Nine-eyed Deer, an irrevocably beautiful creature, which now, as I write this, I am astounded did not jolt me into lucidity and force the realisation of my dreaming. 

I was simply too overwhelmed in awe by the beauty of Her; 

The neighbours soon appeared just outside the door of the Annex, and I started to pick up dog after dog, bringing them out to laughing crowds of dog-parents; smiling as each one's warmth was held against my hand and chest, and I held each one with such love, wishing them well, hoping the scent of whatever they'd come for satisfied them sufficiently, or that maybe they, if not here, would eventually find what they had so desperately been sniffing for. 


The only owner that entered the threshold of the Annex I had for just a few hours called my temporary home, was my paternal Aunt; all but estranged (in this waking world), as my Uncle, since coming out as trans. 

She[^s][^h][^e] told me the Nine-Eyed Deer was hers, and I realised I had been wise to keep my distance, and not attempt to uShe[^s][^h][^e]r the majesty of this Being from the makeshift 'home' that had been loaned to me. 

Why was She[^s][^h][^e] Looking in this place, I could not call Home? 

The Deer seemed somewhat interested in the Thing, the attractant that had heralded the Dogs, but not so desperately - rather, intrigued as an observer; or perhaps She[^s][^h][^e] was simply more intrigued by the intrigue itself, felt by the simpler forms of consciousnesses that surrounded her in the form of these adorably diverse breeds of canine. 

I had my body turned slightly away from the Deer, for fear She[^s][^h][^e] may charge at me, for 'Deer' is certainly not sufficient lexicon to describe this life-form (She[^s][^h][^e] had (as with her four sets of Eyes (plus the one larger, all-knowing eye)) in the centre of her ((visually) soft-lit and light-emitting) visage), perhaps to replace the latter encapsulated 'E' with an 'A', may be more appropriate for this Dear One. An anti-cthulu-esque network of dendritic Antlers; spiralled into undoubted patternicity-- Branches of a =n Yggdrasil; bearing Fibonacci-Pitted Fruits; Forbidden from Human hands. 

It is no question; That: the Nine-Eyed Deer was The Goddess. 
Perhaps The Sophia, The Unknowable Wisdom, or Christ-Consciousness, or the Remembering of Providence that Christ Herself was trying to grasp the Memory of, once She[^s][^h][^e] had been stripped of her Serpent[^s], formed a 'He' or The Lamb Now Grown; was the answer, to the True Question, which I asked, in the dream, to the dreaming of the Memory of what my Aunt had once meant to me, from the lack of meaning I now am to her, or her Shadowed after-image of Love, as She[^s][^h][^e] stood directly to the left of me:

"Is She[^s][^h][^e] Dangerous?"

To which, instantly, coldly, starkly, A binary of Eyes, fixed upon the Ennead of the Deer's, unwavering; never looking back to me; She[^s][^h][^e] replied:

"Yes."

Awake, 

I Was; A Wake. 

I am as I was; WaShe[^s][^h][^e]d away by the Wake of a Wave; I am. 

As all ways, watched by the Angel atop the [[Library]] --

As Singular as [[Infinity]], this Infinite Mirror, [[BORN TO BE THE SKY|The Sky.]] 

A Sighing Goodbye to that Dreamspace, 

And now, taking my place again in the Loss, Hearing the shuffle of my Child's Little Feet, rapt by innocences of his own Sweet Dreaming; while wrapped in his soft She[^s][^h][^e]ets, Beneath my Feet of the Miles of Monstrous Mirror I am, to the Angel He is, at the Foot of my Bed;

I Walk as I woke; Alone-Without-The-L-for-Loss-within-"All One"-yet-not-alone-yet-All-'One'; Within: Alone.

I Walk with the Sun affronting me, to the Ache of Light that breaks, My Heart, in its fleeting, Hears again[^h]. I have closed the instrument encasing All; my modes of Speech. 

As my Son, my Sun, He follows me in, halting this Practice with a Presence I Never thought I could know, and yet, here we are; together, against the Something I have only heretofore known as The Unknown; but now, having Lost and begot my own innocence; this Unknown's face becomes clearer than the Sky, that once had Blinded all Nine of my "I"s. 

A Wound, Wound Round In The Wind, With Words that May Never Wish Describe It; A Wound from a War Unwinnable, Now Walled, Wavering, Wet-Weathered and Withered by the Wonder of a Wean, Waning Weeping, What Whispers of What Women, Within This World of Wallpaper, Would Have Held The Willing Words That Would Have Told Me: We Were All I Ever Wanted?

I sit down at the Opposing Window, for one of the final times Here, in this House atop this Building, Schismatic in its Splitting, between Owners ever-absent, uncaring for the Sanctity of the little unassuming lives, left Stepping Hefting Stones of a Suffering weariness, So helpless to the Dangling Sword of Damocles above; to be Stripped any moment of their She[^s][^h][^e]lter. S is not for She[^s][^h][^e]lter. S is for the Insidious Slither of Something Else[^s]. 


And somehow, I am, One-Eyed, only just realising the Yellow Bow [[The Yellow Cupids Bow, Phonemes Between - on The Matter of the Sun and Moon|The Yellow Bow]] on my windowsill, garlanding the Wilting lilies that my Sister gave me for my Birthday. And somehow, Only Just, in the midst of this latest Unjustness; I am two, I am to realise what All of this Memory, all of the Means of Making, of Making This Misery and Meandering Metacognition of 'Me's, What All of My Mesmerising Murmurations of Melodies of Dreams[^e]; 

Mean.
