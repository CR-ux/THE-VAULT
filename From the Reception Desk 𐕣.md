EPIGRAPH

> "*{REDACTED} talked to us at length about a great scheme for writing a novel in the first person, using a narrator who omitted or corrupted what happened and who ran into various contradictions, so that only a handful of readers, a very small handful, would be able to decipher the horrible or banal reality behind the novel. From the far end of the corridor, the mirror was watching us; and we discovered, with the inevitability of discoveries made late at night, that mirrors have something grotesque about them.*"

-  **Borges, Jorge Luis - Tlon, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius**, [[Ex Libris Borges]]

FOR WORD
--

As will be apparent to all members by now, the works of One Jorge Luis Borges have been discovered to be Apocrypha of Prophetic Revelation. All of Borges' characters, narratives, and universes appear to be materialising into Form, within our Knot-Known universe. 

We Pray To Our Unknown Gods That Nobody Will Read These Words.

ABSTRACT
--

Recent Illuminations, as All will know by then, are to have far-reaching implications for the society, and for the Merger of the Fields of Fiction|Non-Fiction as a Whole, predicted to occur some time around 31/05/2025. We prove within this Work that Reality operates within a Complementary Base Pair System of Enantiodromic Opposite Charge; which means all layers of Fiction and Non-fiction nested within one another, must be Ordered in a {Fiction {Non-Fiction} }$n$ modality, with all Characters contained within a story of Fiction in actuality being Non-Fictional, or in actuality, and all Characters, or Personages within a Non-fictional story are rendered Fictionally, or Figuratively. This means that All of Us, Each Society Member and Non-Member, leave this plane of Reality upon being written into a Story.[^lexDefS]



We present here a Repository of Nested Academic Literature, encoded in the Canonical Nomenclature of our internal Cipher Logic, and we ask, as always, that this information, and the files therein, not be shared with any Civilians, or indeed members of the Opposing Side of the Board.

Figure 4. Three Dimensional Knotting.

Findings suggest:

- The central Queen axis mediates all diagonal and orthogonal communications.
    
- Borges' "Ficciones" behaves as a gravitational object in the narrative field.
    
- All vents lead back to the centre.
    
- All mirrors lead inward.
