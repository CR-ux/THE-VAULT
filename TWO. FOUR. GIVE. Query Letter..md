Print & Format Note:

In the digital manuscript (attached as PDF), all footnotes—descending spiral staircases, really— are hyperlinked via custom scripting, and appear at the close of each movement, rather than at the book’s end. This preserves narrative pacing and avoids premature exposure. For print, each movement would begin with an in-universe directive:

“DO://KNOT CYTE. YOUR SOURCE IS: page X.”

Reading this work positions the reader as both archivist and architect in the disassembly and re-annealing of meaning—implicating them as replication machinery of the narrative itself. It emulates the spirit of the choose-your-own-adventure books I once escaped into—only this one has no escape.

TWO. FOUR. GIVE. is a 99,666-word speculative literary transnovel: a genre-queered, page-as-performance work of genomic mythopoeia. It’s split between the logic of creation, and the creation of logic. With a cast of transgender characters—as in, letters. From the woman I am, to the sacred world of queers who wrote me. Sealed and bare, in ten thousand screaming voices, of the scared trans girl I was. Hunting, in her silent little words, for the words that may have borne, or birthed, or bared her.

TWO. FOUR. GIVE. is an unforgiving story about the war of forgiveness: it builds itself, fractures itself, and rewrites itself—dragging the reader into the page, to ferociously claw its way out. Without apology.

It begins—or ends—
in a system of six, more or less, hospital rooms. Four characters: the bases of DNA, the basis of the story's spiral, wake with no names. An endlessly foldable scroll of wallpaper, a one-way circular system of vents, and their blood, are their only components of correspondence. What follows is a cacophony for N voices— each unzipping to unveil another— schism of selfhood and other, nested within footnotes of a self-replicating reality; a reeling mutaverse narrating itself in two opposing constructed languages. A mise en abyme.

Not so much rooted in 'breaking the fourth wall' as 'forking the repository to burrow an escape route under it', the novel is ambitious, viciously queer, and it is everything I have left. 

The intersecting, looping narrative structure underpins a central idea:
that division is paradoxically the key to integration, that forgetting is the only way we may remember. That as the Circular Book of consciousness separated into endless tomes, from the Source it budded from, it could finally transcribe infinite translations of itself. 
And with the most dysfunctional and co-dependent marriage — that between meaning and memory — there is no such thing as a reliable narrator.

From parenthood: a shaman mother and bioinformatician father, alchemical partners who together birth both an academic field and a child, each forged from opposites. And N—a mythopoeic figure, reading a choose-your-own-adventure story to their child within an infinite Tundra of Bothies— ultimately revealed as Nietzsche.

To childhood: a performance artist, born of aforementioned witch and genomicist, whose terrible fate unfurls as a table-formatted Left-hand, Right-hand path of inevitability; 
and N's child, who realises that most-harrowing truth - that all fiction is magick in the vessel of a lie, and that all lying is just fiction; the vessel of magick, epitomised in a medieval calligrapher who, to escape her hanging, transforms into a funnel spider.

And birthed from these, Romance. Between synthetic and organic counterparts- in counterpoint of consciousness through eternity. Through olfactory-based art installations that overwrite memory—memories of the characters' stories, and the story the reader holds in their own hands. 

The narrative loop closes in a way which makes the text a horror deeper than viscera (though the book has that, too): the horror of a single, terrified author, birthing a universe against her will—only to be devoured by it. The inmost cycle of this uncontrollable labyrinth of versions escapes into the 'non-fictional' world via QR code, leading to a GitHub repository with a narrative of its own, iterated in the commit messages of its version control. 

And here, at the centre, which is the shell; the script- is the machinery, a teeming colony, the pseudoScholars of Lexicomythography, a so-called 'fictional' field of study. Their schismatic society known as ARIA|DNE.

---

This is the queering of a query of a novel written against genre, against silence, and silencing. A speculative literary labyrinth, rooted in trans mythopoeia, genomic poetics, and the love only found in forgiveness.
