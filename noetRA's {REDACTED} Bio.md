**Callie Rose Petal** (born 17 April 1994) is a Scottish [avant-garde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avant-garde "Avant-garde") [conceptual performance artist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_artist "Conceptual artist"), [composer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composer "Composer"), [software developer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_developer "Software developer"), and language artist.[1] Her work spans [experimental literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_literature "Experimental literature"), [noise composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_music "Noise music"), and [transmedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmedia_storytelling "Transmedia storytelling") ritual.[2] She is known for her work as a "noise alchemist"[3] , fusing [experimental sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_sound "Experimental sound"), [ritual structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritual "Ritual"), and [semiotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotics "Semiotics").[4]

**Early life and creative development**

Petal demonstrated academic aptitude from an early age but experienced delayed diagnosis of [ADHD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder") and [autism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism "Autism"), a manifestation of [twice-exceptionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twice_exceptional "Twice exceptional").[3] Her initial creative output was [poetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetry "Poetry"),[5] later expanding into [music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music "Music") and [visual art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_arts "Visual arts"), particularly through her album cover designs.[6] Her background in [bioinformatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics "Bioinformatics") and [scientific research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_research "Scientific research") into [virology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology "Virology")[7] eventually integrated into her [interdisciplinary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity "Interdisciplinarity") [transtextual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transtextuality "Transtextuality")narrative framework, **Lexicomythography**[8], which leverages these diverse specialisms into a research methodology for characters within her [multiverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_universe "Fictional universe").[9]

Her creative practice initially served as a shield against the difficulties of growing up [trans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender "Transgender") in the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom "United Kingdom"),[10][11] later shifting from insular, [contemplative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemplation "Contemplation") solitary work to "performance-as-purge"[12], and ultimately reaching a balance through [integration of these opposites.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemical_marriage "Alchemical marriage")[3] This trajectory underpins the central arc of the short film _What It Means to Be_[13], filmed over three years, which documents her navigation of [transition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_transition "Gender transition"), [chronic illness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_illness "Chronic illness"), and artistic growth.

Petal also hosts and curates the radio show “the medium is the wreckage” on [EHFM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EHFM "EHFM")[14], where she "explores the many forms that abrasion takes"; showcasing original noise works, abrasive soundscapes, [spoken word poetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoken_word "Spoken word") fragments and her writings and personal reflections, which [merge fiction and nonfiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autofiction "Autofiction") — a [literary method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_method "Literary method") reminiscent of [Borges'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Luis_Borges "Jorge Luis Borges") work.[15]

**Career**

Petal’s practice involves the design of [fictional languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_language "Fictional language"), hybrid systems blending [constructed linguistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language "Constructed language") elements[16] with [esoteric programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language "Esoteric programming language") features[17], used and/or written by characters and entities within her narrative universe, along with the [compilation of conceptual dictionaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicography "Lexicography").[18] She interlaces [programming logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_in_computer_science "Logic in computer science") with [mythopoetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythopoeia "Mythopoeia") frameworks to create complex [symbolic meanings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language "Formal language"). She was a [Creative Informatics](https://creativeinformatics.org/) Resident Entrepreneur[19] in Edinburgh, exploring [transmedia narrative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmedia_storytelling "Transmedia storytelling") [platforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_platform_\(infrastructure\) "Digital platform (infrastructure)") integrating audio, [computational statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_statistics "Computational statistics"), and digital storytelling.

She holds a published academic background in virology and [bioinformatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics "Bioinformatics"), contributing notably to research on [avian influenza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza "Avian influenza") during her time as a Researcher at [The Roslin Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roslin_Institute "Roslin Institute").[7] While at Roslin, she received the Outstanding Student Experience Award for her [extracurricular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracurricular_activity "Extracurricular activity") work, introducing [inclusive bathrooms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unisex_public_toilet "Unisex public toilet") on all floors of the Institute and organising its first [queer/ally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_ally "Straight ally") social events.[20] Petal has stated that this scientific foundation underpins her creative work, drawing influence from intersecting [biological and computational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_biology "Computational biology") methodologies.[9][11]

She [composed the score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Score_composer "Score composer") and starred in the [short documentary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_documentary_film "Short documentary film") _What It Means to Be_[13] by [Lea Luiz de Oliveira](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm9878780/?ref_=tt_ov_dr_1), which won [Best Short Documentary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_award "Film award") at the [KASHISH Pride Film Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KASHISH_Pride_Film_Festival "KASHISH Pride Film Festival").[21] It was screened in [Edinburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh "Edinburgh"),[22] [Glasgow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow "Glasgow"),[11] and [Brussels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels "Brussels"),[23] with Petal participating in post-screening Q&As.

As a [performance artist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_artist "Performance artist"), she was commissioned by the international queer art showcase [Homografía Festival](https://homografia.com/) in Brussels, presenting hybrid works of live performance, noise composition, and ritual. Her commissioned performance work at Homografía 2023, _IF ONLY HANDS COULD SPEAK_,[2] was a multidisciplinary ritual, drawing from the [myth of Philomela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philomela "Philomela") as [catharsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catharsis "Catharsis") for her own experience of [sexual trauma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse "Sexual abuse").[2] The piece involved "staged [self-mutilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-mutilation "Self-mutilation") with [theatrical blood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatrical_blood "Theatrical blood"), a [prosthetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis "Prosthesis") tongue, [live painting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_painting "Live painting"), and ended with [aggressive extended vocal technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screaming_\(music\) "Screaming (music)") in an open, industrial venue, addressing themes of forced vulnerability and biological essentialism imposed on trans women".[4] The performance piece was premiered in a [gallery installation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_installation "Art installation") at [LTD Ink Corporation](https://ltdinkcorporation.com/) in Edinburgh.[24][25] Petal delivered a hybrid live art performance with electric double bass and keyboards, mixing field recordings, noise and queer industrial music at Edinburgh's Sneaky Pete's in 2022.[26][27][28]

Her 2020 [one-woman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-woman_show "One-woman show") [durational performance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endurance_art "Endurance art") _HOW MUCH DO I HAVE TO BLEED_ explored embodied exhaustion, [censorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship "Censorship"), and audience proximity, performed bound and gagged, drenched in blood, and marked with the names of [trans people killed in acts of violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence_against_transgender_people "Violence against transgender people") that year, an act of [endurance art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endurance_art "Endurance art") amplifying themes of silenced grief and bodily vulnerability during the COVID-19 pandemic.[4] It was documented and accompanied by her 2020 orchestral release, _GAUDIA,_ in _What It Means to Be._[13]

She is also a software developer, incorporating technical expertise into [interactive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_art "Interactive art"), [narrative-driven systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative_art "Narrative art") and [digital artworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_art "Digital art").[29]

Petal releases music under her current alias [ⁿᵒᵗBorges](https://notborges.bandcamp.com/). Earlier releases appeared under the names [lonely carp](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0n7d5KiQLCVSD2WsdTn9sF?si=7u-XjMLIRPWlEaTiAiO7GQ) and [CARPVS MORTVVM](https://carpvs.bandcamp.com/album/the-woman-in-the-ward-chapels-wallpaper-working-title-lonely-carp-final-release-under-this-moniker-final-title-the-woman-locked-in-the-ward-out-of-the-chapels-wallpaper-draft).[29] As lonely carp, she released several works including the album _[KATABASIS](https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/lonely-carp/katabasis-an-underworld-opera/): an underworld opera_,[[1]](https://www.somegreatreward.scot/lonely-carp-katabasis-an-underworld-opera) an [experimental live opera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera "Opera") of noise composition and ritual [theatre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_theatre "Experimental theatre") which, according to a review in 2022, developed a significant following.[30] She premiered _KATABASIS_ at [Summerhall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summerhall "Summerhall")'s Anatomy Lecture Theatre, a converted veterinary school space featuring raised wooden horseshoe seating,[31] over a series of two intimate performances in Edinburgh.[4] The concerts involved gradually stripping naked to expose vulnerability, thematically exploring [survival sex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_sex "Survival sex")—a form of sex work prevalent amongst trans women,[32] often rooted in [socio-economic marginalisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_exclusion "Social exclusion").[32] She also performed _KATABASIS_ at the [StagEHd festival](https://stagehdfestival.wordpress.com/) in the [Ross Bandstand](https://rossbandstand.org/), an open-air stadium in [Princes Street Gardens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princes_Street_Gardens "Princes Street Gardens").

She has appeared on the compilation cassette _No Authority Without Corruption, No Power Without Abuse_,[33] released by the label [Venalism](https://venalism.bandcamp.com/), to which she is currently signed.[34] A forthcoming double cassette release on Venalism, titled _Xˡᶦᵇʳᶦˢ_ ,[35] extends her literary practice through a noise-based conceptual framework.[34]

Petal’s first musical performance was at age 18, supporting [Diane Cluck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Cluck "Diane Cluck") at the [Tin Music and Arts](https://thetinmusicandarts.org.uk/events/?category=music&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=7626677415&gbraid=0AAAAAC7Su5mpGLckhr9AulPYB9VAh3L-3&gclid=Cj0KCQjwotDBBhCQARIsAG5pinNpiNmqrRTckYMAjYfhezgL1z8DkhuXXDjsktyqQLvWasc2POXmQbMaAloQEALw_wcB) in [Coventry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coventry "Coventry").[36] She has supported the Melbourne duo [Divide and Dissolve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide_and_Dissolve "Divide and Dissolve") at [The Hug and Pint](https://www.thehugandpint.com/) in Glasgow, in 2022.[37] She also supported [Extra Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra_Life_\(band\) "Extra Life (band)") at a Venalism-organised show at The Banshee Labyrinth in Edinburgh.[12][38] That same year, Petal performed in the full [Edinburgh Fringe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_Festival_Fringe "Edinburgh Festival Fringe") run of _SHE/HER_, produced by [Brian Cox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Cox_\(actor\) "Brian Cox (actor)") and Actor Rising Productions.[39] Her musical performance—combining an original vocal and accordion composition with interpretive dance—earned standout reviews[40][41] for its emotional intensity and storytelling.[42]

**Style and influences**

Petal’s multidisciplinary practice integrates experimental literature,[4] abrasive music production[48]—often accompanying visceral ritual performance[2]— and digitally innovative [alternate reality game (ARG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_reality_game "Alternate reality game") creation.[49] These elements coalesce in her broader framework of **Lexicomythography**, an interwoven system of symbolic expression grounded in mythopoesis and semiotic design. She employs a “noise alchemist” approach,[3] integrating ritual structure and semiotics within an "artifact-as-artefact"[1] framework.[50] Her sonic practice treats breakdown and distortion not as flaws but as compositional forces.[22] Loss, grief, and otherness emerge as structural catalysts of affect and form within her broader conceptual themes.[51]

Her trans identity and lived experience inform much of her work’s thematic exploration.[19][50][32]

Her literary practice employs fragmentation, redaction, and intentional illegibility,[29] aligning with principles of contemporary noise literature, paralleling her sonic work.[52] Her "page-as-performance"[1] engages [self-reflexive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-reference "Self-reference") [narrative techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative_techniques "Narrative techniques"),[53] exploring textual instability and reader positioning. This [metafictional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metafiction "Metafiction") methodology employs [intertextuality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertextuality "Intertextuality") by embedding fictional publications[54] as [fractalised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal "Fractal") texts within a larger narrative architecture.[55]

ⁿᵒᵗBorges is both her musical [moniker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moniker "Moniker")[56] and the [pseudonym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonym "Pseudonym") for her broader transmedia and literary work[57], the latter encompassing over one million words,[58] structured as a layered, [recursive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion "Recursion") universe, composed of cryptic fragments and multimedia forms.[8] According to Petal’s own conceptual framing, ⁿᵒᵗBorges functions as an inversion of Borges’ literary approach: rather than referencing fictional works, it actively creates[59] them—fictional, nested sources,[60] that deepen the labyrinthine dialogue between the story and self-reference.[61] This embodies a self-described “neophilological”[62] practice, synthesising chaotic, hypergraphic and compulsive art[29] with stillness and structure, likened to genetic material dissolved and rebound as triple strands[63] — an [alchemical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemy "Alchemy") metaphor for the project’s self-replicating, interwoven layers.[64]

**Immersive storytelling and metanarrative work**

Petal’s durational narrative project incorporates fictional languages,[16][17] mythopoeic systems,[54] and interlinked documents[18] distributed across textual, sonic, visual, performative, and digital forms. She has described her narrative work as “a durational literary project that will undoubtedly last the rest of [her] life”, stating that she aims “to frame the conditions of marginalisation [she], and so many others have been dealt, not as absences, but as generative states of meaning.”[9]

Petal coined **Lexicomythography**,[1] a [pseudo-academic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-academic "Pseudo-academic") field that centres mythopoesis through [etymology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymology "Etymology") and dissection of The Word, as both a creative schema and a critical commentary on the exclusionary politics of traditional academia,[1] particularly from the perspective of a queer, disabled woman in STEM.[20] Through Lexicomythography and the compilation of a Dictionary, the ever-evolving _lexDict_,[18] Petal explores the spiritual resonance of language, recursive meaning-making, and the generative power of myth as a counterpoint to rigid scientific structures, challenging conventional boundaries between science, art, and identity.[9] It forms the basis of her multiyear project, _The Children’s Gospel Music Songbook_,[65] one of the narrative fictional canons within the wider ⁿᵒᵗBorges multiverse. She presents _ARIA|DNE_, the Society of _Lexicomythographers_, as a secretive group,[8] compiling dictionaries[18] and creating intentionally obfuscated, recursive texts[66] as a form of transmedia ritual and creative resistance.[67]

She maintains multiple independently-produced, continuously updated digital platforms as part of the Lexicomythography project,[4] along with a regularly updated GitHub profile[68] of multiple in-universe repositories,[69] featuring narrative threads encoded within pull requests and commit messages.[70] These repositories serve not only as technical infrastructure, but as canonical extensions of the Lexicomythography multiverse, embedding recursive narrative logic and symbolic lexicons into the very architecture of their version control.[71] Many serve as Trailheads (ARG entry points),[4] the first introduced via post linking to the initiation video[72] by the artist on the subreddit r/ARG.[73] Examples include:

- An interactive [command-line interface (CLI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface "Command-line interface"), itself an in-universe entity[49]
- A 'Choose Your Own Adventure' applet[74] tied to The _Children’s Gospel Music Songbook_, with a digitised manuscript portal[65]
- A podcast integrating AI-generated narrative segments,[67]
- The _‘Journals of ARIA|DNE_ pseudo-academic repository[75], framing the narrative universe through layers of '[institutional access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_publishing "Academic publishing")'

These platforms operate both as standalone [art objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_objects "Art objects") and as active interfaces for her immersive ARG-like narrative—blending [magick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceremonial_magic "Ceremonial magic"), software development, scientific method, and trans [mysticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysticism "Mysticism") within the [secret society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_society "Secret society") framework that permeates her fictional multiverse.[72][9]

**Personal life**

Petal lives and works in Scotland. She has publicly discussed her experiences living with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome,[22] a connective tissue disorder that impacts her mobility and energy levels, shaping many aspects of her daily life and creative practice. The condition posed challenges to her medical transition.[13] She has written about undergoing gender-affirming surgeries in personal essays scattered across her website.[94] She continues hormone replacement therapy, as documented in the short film ‘‘What It Means to Be’’.[11]

Petal has openly described experiencing psychotic episodes, including symptoms such as [hypergraphia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergraphia "Hypergraphia") and [clanging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clanging "Clanging"), which she integrates into her creative methodology.[95] These experiences are narrativised by the pseudonymous persona ‘The Woman in the Wallpaper’,[96] credited as the author of _The Children’s Gospel Music Songbook_[65]—a central text in the recursively layered universe of Lexicomythography.[29]

The project originated during a psychiatric hospitalisation in late 2024,[65] and its central text, _RED_RING_PARALLEL_,[97] encodes this period within densely layered [metatext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatextuality "Metatextuality"),[8] accessible only through oblique traversal of her site’s symbolic architecture.[98]

Petal is also neurodivergent, and has spoken about being autistic and having ADHD,[3] as well as experiencing traits associated with schizotypal perception and cognition.[99] Her creative practice is informed by considerations of access,[100] disability justice,[19] the temporal rhythms imposed by chronic illness[13] and neurodivergence.[11]

She has also reflected on her own survivorhood,[101] which informs the themes of grief, resilience, and recovery across her work. Her advocacy for trauma-informed creative spaces[29] draws from this history, shaping both her artistic and community-facing practices.[19] These layered perspectives influence her approach to pacing, ritual, and the thematic navigation of pain, embodiment, and altered states.[19]
