_TWO. FOUR. GIVE._ is a 100,000-word speculative literary transnovel. It is a self-replicating, genre-queered, page-as-performance work, split between the logic of creation, and the creation of logic. With a cast of transgender characters- as in, letters. From the woman I am, to the sacred world of queers who wrote me. Sealed, and bare, in ten thousand scared and screaming voices, of that scarred trans girl I was. Hunting, in her silent little words, for the words that might have read her.
 TWO. FOUR. GIVE. Is an unforgiving story that builds itself. Fractures itself, and rewrites itself-- that drags the reader into the page, to ferociously claw its way out. Without apology.

It begins—or ends—
in a system of six, more or less, hospital rooms. Four characters: the bases of DNA, the basis of the story's spine, wake with no names. An endlessly foldable scroll of wallpaper, a one-way circular system of vents, and their blood, are their only components of correspondence. What follows is a cacophony for N voices, each unzipping to reveal another, schism of selfhood and other, nested within footnotes of a self-replicating narrative multiverse. As a fractal.

Not so much 'fourth-wall-breaking' as broken out of four walls, to become the wallpaper of another; the novel is ambitious, viciously queer, and it is everything I have left. 

The intersecting, looping narrative structure underpins a central idea - that division is paradoxically the key to integration, that forgetting is the only way we may remember. That as the Circular Book of consciousness separated into endless tomes, from the Source it budded from, it was able to read infinite translations of itself. And, with the most dysfunctional and co-dependent marriage --that between meaning and memory-- there is no such thing as a reliable narrator.

Following parenthood; a shaman mother and bioinformatician father--who birth not just an academic field of opposites, but a child just the same-- and a mythopoeic figure, N, reading a choose-your-own-adventure story to their child in an infinite Tundra of Bothies, eventually revealed as Nietzsche.

To childhood; a performance artist, born of aforementioned witch and genomicist, whose terrible fate unfurls as a table-formatted Left-hand, Right-hand path of inevitability; 
and N's child, who realises that most-harrowing truth - that all fiction is magick in the vessel of a lie, and that all lying is just fiction; the vessel of magick. 

And Romance, of course, between synthetic and organic counterparts- in counterpoint of consciousness through eternity. Through olfactory-based art installations causing overwritten memory; memory of the characters' stories, and the story that the reader holds themselves. 

The narrative loop closes in a way which makes the text a kind of horror deeper than traditional viscera (which the book also has)-- It unveils the horror of a single, terrified author, birthing a universe against her will, and that universe devouring her. The inmost layer of this recursive labyrinth reaches out into the 'non-fictional' world, through a QR code leading to a GitHub repository, with a narrative of its own, sealed in the commit messages and pull requests of its version control. 

And here, at the centre, which is the shell; the script- is the machinery, a teeming colony, the pseudoScholars of Lexicomythography, a so-called 'fictional' field of study. Their schismatic society known as ARIA|DNE.

---

This is the queering of a query of a novel written against genre, against silence, and silencing. A speculative literary labyrinth, rooted in trans mythopoeia, genomic poetics, and the love only found in forgiveness.
