Epitaph

> *In reality, for the serious Gnostic, death is the goal. Death is our crown; it is the crowning achievement of the Gnostic. That is not to say that the Gnostic seeks physical death as an escape, a way to avoid life, or that Gnostics want to rush out and be killed physically. That is not the meaning of my statement. The Gnostic works intensely to preserve life, and does everything in his or her power to protect life, including their own. All life is extremely precious. What the Gnostic aspires towards is a perfect death: a death at the right moment, at the right time, because that perfect death is the gateway to real existence.*
> 
> *The existence that we have now is not real, it is an illusion. What we see as existence is fundamentally mistaken. What we see, and perceive, and taste, and touch, and hear is all filtered by subjective elements in our psyche, and thus, we do not see reality. Through a perfect death, we gain perception of what is real.*
> 
> *The goal of the Gnostic is to achieve a perfect death and to prepare for it every day. It can be said that Gnosis is a science of training for death. It is a process of dying that initiates new levels of birth. The trajectory of our existence is thereby altered, upwards, into higher forms of life.*
> 
> *Death is the goal for the real Gnostic who is practicing seriously. whether that person is called Gnostic, Buddhist, Muslim, Hindu, or Christian is irrelevant. By Gnostic, we mean someone who is acquiring conscious spiritual experience. For that person, their spiritual process is a process of dying, not physically, but psychologically. Real spiritual work is a continual process of radical psychological death, in which all that is illusion, all that is false, dies, and what is born is truth, cognizance of what is real.*[^s]
