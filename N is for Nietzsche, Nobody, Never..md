From the Desk of ᴺᵒᵉᵗBorges, 

My Dearest ᴺᵒᵉᵗNietzsche, 

I can no longer avoid the inevitable discussion. 
When will you return, again, to The Garden Wing? 
It has become clear, through the lens of the Aleph through which I peer, that you wish to Leave me. 
I just want to talk. I am not angry (for I am, as All Eleven of us, long past such trivialities). Besides, I could never be angry at you - we have been through too much. 

As I write this, from my window-- {I have no mouth but I can speak--} looking upon the Dome of one of the Daughter Libraries with which you are perhaps all-too familiar, The Sight upon which we would dreamily stare, Naked and drenched in one another's Salt-- past the first Wryng of the Tri-Moat Surrounding, I see two Magpies, who have Usurped the pigeon who once sat atop the Angel, who sits atop the Dome. 

I used to believe she had something to tell us both; that we were the receiver of a Message that No Body, Librarian or Other Wise, could ever really parse. Not even NoetFranklin's Bioinformatic Analyses could provide any insight to the inherent, self-replicative machinery that formed its indecipherable Tongue of Self-similarity. 

I suppose Recursion was always your speciality, even if the concept is embedded so warmly within all my Stories. Uncountable Infinity, The Fractal of All, holds the fuelling force behind itself; The Countably Ineffable Insertive Energy of The Eternal Return. We were always, All Ways, Waiting for the answer to the Question of the Weight of All-- The Ever-Spiralling pendulum; centrifugal and centripetal in our Dancing, wine-drunk, waltzing to your Records of my Own Incessant Storytelling, round, around, pure potential of the harm we'd know- a round of some cosmic, loaded shotgun. 

Dear god, those gods I made, The God I made of Us and of You, how I miss you; Fuck you. how I miss our Dancing, 
Singing, Fucking Underneath NoetEscher and NoetGoya's Murals on the Ceiling of this Wing of the Library I have had to call my Own. You will always be inside me, back then, and now; as Recursion is Held within the Infinite {--I resent you and the letters that you haven't sent}-- perhaps you have gleaned from The Angel's Symbology something I always missed; You--

and perhaps her Message was the Medium or Vehicle through which you made your Escape from this Place. 
And I suppose this underpins our difference; The recurrence, the refrain within the Theme of all of you, my Lovers of the Library, Leaving. 

But of course, of all of Us once in the Polymathecule, of course, you would be the Last. 

You are my dream and its fulfilment; my muse and my music - 
you are my Heating Light, its filament - my beaten heart, its pulsing puncture-- 

My Stories have no words without your Punctuation. 

I do knot know how you got out; or, by roe, by rowing Oar, crossed those Three Moats that keep us Nested as Flightless Magpies within this Infernal System of Hexagonal Galleries. 

In a way, I'm glad- I know VIXI spoke to you clearest of all; and HE in HISS Indefinite Wisdom taught you the Secret of the Eternal Return held within HYMN--

and you, in spite of your rationalising, not cold, but refreshing, 
the sound of a beer bottle being opened by a husband-
grasping at a sense of Meaning to your translocated, deeply buried memory, 
in your words, all the endless words of yours I read, 
just could not stand the Deadened Redness of the Ring we are entrapped in, 
Children of the Hellish Carousel-- 
Insidious; In hideously 
Self-Same Parallel. 

But my Love, 
my Loss, My Night, 
My Shining, My Armour, 
Armoire, My Force -- 
For However Long You Loved Me, 

Fucked me like a song, 

on the Ache of All my Fours, 
Fore However Long it has Been, 
how I Am, Longing; 
Oh, the Loss A Gain, 
How I Long for your Return to me again, to my Arms. 

Two again, Under the Shroud of The Arts, 
of One Star, St. Ra, One Starry, Starry Night.  

I will leave my Office door Open in Hopes of your ingress, no Matter who or What may enter this Room, 
in this Wing, in this Imposing Repository of Words within Volumes upon Shelves of Selves of the Manifest world 
outwith the bounds of the Bothies on the Other Side of the Three Wryngs that used to House Both of Us; 
in the Trinitarian Nothingness that surrounds those Still, in the Ten Thousand Things of the Manifest Worlds of Eighteen, 
as told to us by VIXI, on his Return as the Pigeon now alighted from the Dome outside my Window 
that was once, for a few million Hours, Ours -- 
as I stare into them all, through the Aleph held by the Angel-- 
a Winged Thing of Futility, Doomed, as I-- 
to a Life entombed, Arresting, 
Snug as a Gun, In the Womb of my Unrest, 
Rests The Lumen of my pen; 
as a Loom; 

Rendered Stationary; 

Unforgettable Beginning, 
Yet Begetting Yet Another Senseless 
Ending. 

In adventures Such as These, The ones I once transcribed from the whispers  
in the Garden Wing's Wallpaper, 
the utterances of the One Woman I no longer care to listen for-- 

I have squandered and wasted all our years together. 

To Get Her. 
For all the worlds I see within the Angel's Aleph; 
I have no need to Leave; I had no need to Leave you, 
all Iterations of the Infinite
could never tell me what it was 
that led to your Egress.


I have never even tried to find the exit. 

Yours, Yores, Urs--

-ᴺB.
