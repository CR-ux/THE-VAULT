in the dream inside the dream, i was invited to see an awful band with my neighbour 
and then my best friend and I had sex in the shower. it was memorable because i am in love with her but i didn't realise i wanted her and in the dream she wanted me. her body was covered in the scars of fresh self-mutilation in the form of words, full caps, her body in the form of art. waking up I realise they were the words I sent to her last night like a flaming, burning, dying meteor. I was so tired from a long night of debauchery that I had to cancel going to the concert but I'd realised it might have been too late. I'd sent him a very long voice note explaining or giving some sort of excuse why I couldn't go. 

He was working at the post office, which was also a bookies, or something. my body was waking up to this dream, in paralysis as I tried to remember to text my neighbour and let him know I couldn't go to the concert 
and lying in bed in the dream I couldn't drag myself out far enough to make sure I'd sent the text. 
And soon enough I heard him break into my flat, but I couldn't get up to stop him, 
nightmarish in sleep-in-dream parallel lysed sleep paralysis; the thing i feel almost every night. 
and every single day. 
those alien sounds in my room, those rustling viruses breaking into the silence of my cell, 
behind my half-sleeping head that faced the angel atop the library - they alerted me i was not alone and this is very often more terrifying than being so. 
i could not check if he was even in there, in the room, with me, at all. 
But then I realised surely this must have been a dream. But I wasn't waking up.
but then i woke up from that dream to a slightly less threatening panic
and realised i'd sent him the voice note in my sleep, that the concert didn't exist, not like it doesn't exist now, but that it didn't exist in that realm of nonexistence and my GP climbed through the computer screen mid sentence like it was nothing. In the middle of having our video appointment, about a bunch of meds I'd found in my house that I didn't want to waste. 

She climbed through, then I asked how the fuck she did it; 
she tried to show me how, by holding my hands and looking into me and breathing. by showing me how to spin with her; by spinning us both around 
I kept trying to make it work but it wasn't going anywhere, we weren't going anywhere
i wasn't going anywhere
and as if betraying dream rules by being aware of their absurdity, she, the doctor in the dream, started to 'explain'- the doctored dream, she tried to fill in the gaps, clearly its architect thinking I would have just accepted its farce- and she told me that her clockwist rotation was what made it possible. and because i was an antickwist spinner i could only drag things to me, not go to them.

when we tried together, holding hands, we levitated for what seemed like minutes;
suspending in rotational flight, from her teleporting and me dragging us back; to leave us there, spinning

she had the visage of my stepmother 
and so in lieu of us going somewhere, i brought it 
and so i brought it to me, 
And so the GP and I were in a large gym space, 
one person and then a few more slowly appearing around us, engaged in different forms of exercise. 

One by one they were scattered, then slowly it became an entire swarm, so slowly--

And I still couldn't teleport like she'd shown me

And then when I challenged them, one of the men told his other troops, and they'd started to turn on us 

As if being aware of the dream's absurdity betrayed the role I was given as a dreamer. 
As if I as a result needed to be punished. 

As the men, uncountably many now, queued us up into conga lines, stripped naked and bare.
Hunting-
And we were led around these almost labyrinths, 
with not walls but these low, low fences, both naked hands on the naked shoulders of the thorax segments of the millipede we were forced to be part of, in front, great snaking lines-
the gym had become a camp
and we knew we were all to die. 

and when my time was near and the group of us, 
lying to the floor, catching, not catching, caught as a self-staring glance in that mirror of sky
in the polished gym floor- just one final look at the bodies we'd held, as an exercise, for a while 
in some sort of futile attempt 
at preventing our bodies leaving the earth, as naked as, more than at birth, 

the doctor was whispering in my ear to just let go now callie, its easier she said just let go
let go now they said it's okay 
as the hundreds of those humans turned, twisted insects around me were shot, one by one 
let go. now he said, it was the not knowing when that had killed me, even before my round had yet found its compatible host
and the two closest to me they were killed, on the left, then the right, and then just me left; 
let go the doctor said it's ok and i wondered if this was my heart's only way of knowing how to cross a boundary

and i did, i woke up from the dream, not to escape but just to write this, but so tired that i fell asleep once more and dreamt of a party of journalists. we were playing a role playing game of exceptional production value. where everyone was assigned a character, like Werewolf, and i was the spider.

they were incredibly rich journalists who had a gigantic home, and the party had all of these themed groups of fractal-parties, each of them actors and characters and people from certain works of media. i was the only one without a group; and i got lost in there, trying to find a bathroom. trying to find a free bathroom in which to take a shower. i used the wrong one which had a garden swing inside it and the owners, who i think were a married gay couple, got mad at me because it set off an alarm which could have alerted the police and got their party shut down.  the one friend i'd made there had asked me to get something for her and i obliged happily. i got lost and somehow in its circularity made my way back to her empty handed. and i made a joke about needing a thread, or at least ariadne.  

in the dream i almost accidentally set a fire, i almost burned the place down and i remember realising the culminating point of the story is not just the characters becoming aware of their author, or even me as the author becoming aware of the god who wrote me. but that the story is god. the smallest causal sequence of events that do not befall or happen to us but drag us toward and under. carry ten times their weight. survive. and it forces itself into being as an insect burrowing into the dirt to survive. any way it can. that party needed to end, in some sort of pain, shame or terror. and it seemed, as it always does, that it needed to be me, not because life {is|was} unfair, whatever that means- but because of the ease of using my infertile worked body as plot for the plot that insists on becoming. a vessel. because of the air in the filth of my self. who i am, where i've been, had to be, how well it is tilled. and filled by the insects, that great teeming six legged insect, the story. for the story.
