The dream began at a diner. at a dining table{REDACTED}And █kept hinting to him that █was so hungry asking what we would eat. {REDACTED} █was still so hungry, █nearly got into the men’s bathroom before █realised a security guard there, and another girl, much younger than me, waiting for her own father. much younger than me. Maybe she was me. Maybe she was the me that █grew out of malnourished and incomplete. █was so hungry. █was so hungry with no money to eat and my father didn’t care. █am so hungry with no money to eat and my father doesn’t care. Maybe if █was fatter █would more resemble your daughter and maybe that’s why my father doesn’t care 

Somewhere in the mess, {REDACTED} was a dentist; who said that he was so sorry but he would have to use an electrical pulse to stimulate the exposed nerves in my fractured tooth, and my face, in order to test that they were still working and to save the nerves, or stop my face from becoming paralysed. {REDACTED} all of them, all of them either apologising {REDACTED} or not apologising at all, or just leaving, just leaving me hungry, even though █kept asking, kept looking for them, kept pleading them to just stop drilling into my bone, please stop drilling into my jaw, please just let me sleep just let me sleep through this, and █was thinking in that dentist chair in that mall in that dream about the memory of my surgeries, {REDACTED}experiences of my face and teeth being {REDACTED}so hungry with no money to eat and my father doesn’t care. 
Last time █saw you, a father, but not mine, we realised that we have the same glasses prescription and that █share a birthday with your mother who is not my grandmother. 

Awake █am trying to find my glasses and thinking about how █could borrow yours if you were here and not with your own children. 

Then █think about my father, again, or for the first time:

One day he will die and █will care.

Back to the little girl waiting at the entrance to the men’s bathroom;

 █said I’m waiting for mine too. I’m waiting for mine too and then █woke up tooth still aching and █can hear my own baby, 

he is hungry again, wanting to get out, and eat, 

my pillow drenched in saliva.

 █am so hungry with no money to eat and my father doesn’t care.
