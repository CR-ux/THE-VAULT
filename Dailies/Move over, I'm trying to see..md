in the dream, i was in a restaurant, which was also an auditorium
Which was inside a hotel 
With, for once, my Father.

The restaurant had staggered rows of seating, like a theatre,
And the tables upon which the food was served, slid out, 

extended from a strangely innovative concertina compaction 
I remember the front row, which offered a choice, 
to sit facing the other dinner guests with which one was eating, 

or to face the screen upon which the production was being played. 
The food had already arrived by the time my family were down from their rooms, 
And I ushered my sister next to me, us facing away from the screen, towards our parents. 

But my father protested our togetherness, saying we wouldn't se the film. 
And he showed me this tabular contraption, this innovation of decided separation. 

He'd reached some sort of breaking point, regarding mine, and my sister's, financial insolvency. 
And I ended the argument by standing up to him, stating that while we had made poor economic decisions, he was the one who had instilled in us this poverty mindset, always fighting, always pushing some boulder up some hill that we'd been cursed with, that he'd been cursed with, that he seemed, intentionally or not, bent upon passing down to us, a Damoclean Sword, stuck forever in a Sisyphean Stone. 


He pushed back, but eventually put his head in his hands, and wept. 

And now, I think of the period just following the revelation, closing the book of my parents marriage; 

That christmas eve, where he found out about the infidelity that I had known about, kept so impossibly secret, as my mother escaped for such long hours to the bathroom, to talk to her lover, now her husband, over a series of unfortunate months; during my A level exams-

And the dinner table we sat, squished, around, the baby grand piano, now long gone, such a long, long time since my fingers have caressed those keys -- my first, and perhaps only, true lover. 

Given away, by my father and stepmother; perhaps because it sat there like Miss Havisham. 

There is nothing sadder than an unplayed piano. In fact, the title of my first real poem, written as a little child, was The Unplayed Piano. 

I wonder what power of these fledgling words has had upon my unplayed tape of a life, gathering dust, in spite of the winding; the whirlwind, dizzingying- spinning. Spinning. 

And my father would repeat, during that harrowing time of all of our lives, nobody getting any sleep-

Oh what tangled webs, we weave. 

And the New Years which followed, I offered to still go on our usual Hogmanay holiday, 

In a forest, in that forest-

Where, him alone in that double room, and I, alone in the twin;

I would hear him, screaming, throwing his shoes at the wall, screaming. Head spinning. Spinning. 

I have never heard such screaming; 

All of my own betrayals have ended with silence. 



And in the dream, I was then in a shop, a quaint and humble little charity shop, 
Where Lea, the director of a documentary about my life, underscoring the strangest Three Years during a pandemic that left me alone, and yet, less lonely than I'd ever been, or maybe ever will be again. 

And Lea had brought in her rapist to the shop. 
And we were in the middle of a fitting, for another film. 
And now, upon waking, I remember her telling me that she only dreams in black and white. How seemingly paradoxical in its fitting, for a filmmaker. 

And as they left, I screamed, not silent, 
as they left I screamed at the man, what he was. 

And then, in her absence, 
I regretted my thoughtlessness,
this secret was not mine to share.
