> *I am telling you in a poem that I do not read to you; I am telling you in the shape of the clouds and what we say about them. I am telling you by looking – and, more often, by not looking. I am telling you by leaving the gate open – yes, the one I normally close. I am telling you in my dreams and I am telling you in a text I wrote but forget to send. I am telling you when I dress up to see you, and I am telling you even more when I don’t. I am telling you in the silence of my listening.I am telling you when I take myself less seriously. I am telling you in the centimetres between our knees – aren’t they different, those centimetres? bigger, fuller? I am telling you in small words, loaded up like pack-mules as they cross the 2m endless plain between us. I am telling you in many ways, and I am telling you the many ways in which I love you. I am telling you without telling, when I trust that you feel it too. I am waiting for you to catch up, and I am waiting for a time with words.*

## LAST NIGHT'S DREAM

in the dream, i was something. in the dream someone asked if they could listen to me and i wasn't the one to ask. in the dream there were people waiting to hear what i had to say and i was running late for something i wasn't actually scared of. in the dream there was a dog, in a cage, made flimsy, and sharp, and all i did was stand and watch, and feed him a bumblebee. in the dream i was something in the dream there were people waiting in the dream there was a dog and there was a bee. in the dream i was in egypt at a crossroads and speaking with a man about the fight against ephemera in the dream i was as solid as the ancient stone i stared at and in the dream i was something in the dream someone asked if they could listentomeandiwasnttheonetoaskinthedreamtherewassomebodywaitingthereweremanypeopletheywerewaitingtohearwhatihadtosayandididnthavetobegtoexistinthedreamiwassomething.gnihtemossawimaerdehtnitsixeotgebotevahtndididnayasotdahitahwraehotgnitiawerewyehtelpoepynamerewerehtgnitiawydobemossawerehtmaerdehtniksaotenoehttnsawidnaemotnetsil listen to me i am telling you that i love you. adrian are you listening to me i know you have no ears but who does anyway. in the dream someone asked if they could listen to me and i wasn't the one to ask. in the dream there was a lonely giant dog and i fed him a dead bumble bee. in the dream i wasn't wishing for a time with words because i was the time the words were written in and in the dream i was something and people were waiting for me. i am waiting for me to catch up to you and i am waiting for a time with words in the dream i hadn't a thing except track of the time before i had to speak to crowds of people waiting for me patiently. listen. i am listening for all the many ways i loved me in the dream i had a home a husband and nothing felt like strangling there. in the dream there was a stream and it was beautiful. i was something in the dream i fed a dog a bumblebee and i don't need to know what this means. because i am still dreaming but here i'm nothing and ask for doctors landlords rapists to hear me when i say to help me in or please get out in the dream i was something in the dream someone asked if they could listen and i didn't have to ask in the dream there were people waiting for me they were waiting and god callie what are you waiting for except someone to hear you scream in the dream there was a dog and i was the dog and the cage and the bee and in the dream i was something. i was something, in the dream
