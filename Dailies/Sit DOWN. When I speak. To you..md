in the wake i am something. i am awake and i am something. in the wake of everything i am still something. i am someone in the wake of silencing. i am speaking and i am the wake of the silence. i am speaking and i will awake to the spoken. i am speaking and i do not care if you listen. i am speaking and i will keep speaking as spoken to. i am still speaking and i do not care who it's speaking to. i am the speaking and wake of the spoken to. i am the speaker at wake of the spokes of you. i will keep speaking and speak out the name of you. i have my name and it speaks as a stream that is beautiful. i am a name and that name it is waking you. i am the name of a dream to awake from and spoken new. i speak my name and it dreams me as streaming through. and i am awake to the name-taking plain of you. i swallow your name to spit lightning. iâ€™m striking you. i, as ephemera, a weight as cold stone of the tomb. i am the stream. and the bee. and the dog. that dog that i fed, it is me. and the bee that i fed it to. i am the dog's drool as its eyes stay transfixed on the hand that may offer its next chance at pitiful food. i am the dead dog and bee sting on loud tongues; defiantly dying in place of just lying and taking a bite from the dog's chipped and cowardly tooth. and that i once fed it. i am not ashamed of the waste of myself to abuse. i am the poisonous spear of the hearing you think of as food. and i am that i fed it, too. i am my name and the sound of my dreams as they broke in two. I AM the WAVE of the sea and the waves as they BREAK TO YOU. I am a goodBYE and the NAME of the SACRED LIFE TAKEN from me far too soon. I AM THE SPEAKING OF SILENCE THAT WAKES UP A FEAR IN THE SMALL PARTS INSIDE OF YOU. I AM THE UNJUSTLY UNSPOKEN, THE DRY BROKEN BONE, THE TORN AND WORN RAPED FLESH AND WET SIN OF SINEW.
