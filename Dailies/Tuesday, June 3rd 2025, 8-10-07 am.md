## LAST NIGHT'S DREAM

in the dream, i was invited to see an awful band with my neigbour
and then my best friend and I had sex. I was so tired from a long night of debauchery that I had to cancel going to the concert buty I'd realised it might have been too late. I'd sent him a very long voice note explaining or giving some sort of excuse why I couldn't go. 
He was working at the post office, which was also a bookies, or something

my gp climbed through the computer screen mid sentence, like it was nothing. In the middle of having our video appt about a bunch of meds I'd found in my house that I didn't want to waste. 

She climbed through, then I asked how the fuck she did it; 
she tried to show me how she'd done it, by spinning around 
I kept trying to make it work but it wasn't going anywhere
and as if betraying dream rules by being aware of their absurdity, she started to 'explain'- the dream tried to fill in the gaps, clearly its architect thibnking I would have just accept its farce- and she told me that the clockwist rotation was what made it possible.

when we tried together, holding hands, we levitated for what seemed like minutes;
suspending in rotational flight, from her teleporting and me dragging us back; to leave us there, spinning

she had the visage of my stepmother 


my body was waking up to this dream, in paralysis as I tried to remember to text my neighbour and let him know I couldn't go to the concert 

and lying in bed in the dream I couldn't drag myself out far enough to make sure I'd sent the text. And soon enough I heard him break into my flat, but I couldn't get up to stop him, or check if he was even there at all. 
But then I realised surely this must have been a dream, 

But I wasn't waking up 


And the GP and I were in a large gym space, one person and then a few more slowly appearing around us, doing different forms of exercise. 

One by one they were scattered, then slowly it became an entire swarm, so slowly--

And I still couldn't teleport like she'd shown me

And then when I challenged them, one of the men told his other troops, and they'd started to turn on us 

as if being aware of the dream's absurdity betrayed the role I was given as a dreamer. As if I as a result needed to be punished. 

As the men, uncountably many now, queued us up into conga lines, stripped naked and bare.

And we were led around these almost labyrinths, with not walls but these low, low fences, both naked hands on the nakes shoulders in front, great snaking lines-
the gym had become a camp
and we knew we were all to die. 


and when my time was near and the group of us, lying to the floor in some sort of futile attempt at preventing our bodies leaving the earth, as naked as, more than at birth, 

the gp was whispering in my ear to just let go now callie, let go
let go now it's okay 
as the hundreds of around me were shot, one by one 
let go. now he said, 
and the two closest were killed, on the left, then the right, then just me left; 
let go the doctor said it's ok and i wondered if this was my heart's only way of knowing how to cross a boundary
