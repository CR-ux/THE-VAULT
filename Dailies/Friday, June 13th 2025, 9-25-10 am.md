## LAST NIGHT'S DREAM


somehow in the dream, i was travelling. 
and some time in the dream, i'd taken the last train back from london, and in the dream i knew i wanted to live there. 
in the dream, i was on the Iberian peninsula, and my sister was driving us around, even though neither of us know how to drive. 
in the dream, i was with a group of friends, most of them from my childhood-- there, in dreams of late, seems only to be friends from my childhood 
i wonder if this means i'm on my way back somewhere
in the dream amanda palmer was there, and a scholar, who seemed bent upon discrediting me 
he had a giant sabre with a glass blade and a reed, and i was playing music with it while he brought the sharp edge closer and closer to my heart. 
in the dream, me and the person i was standing next to, whoever it was-- we were always searching for something.
somewhere--
and some time in the dream, they'd arrived; my friends had brought them with them;
i just wish they'd find their way out of my dreams
it has been too long and i just want to dream 

of somewhere i can have to myself 

in the dream, a boy from primary school and i had taken to london, where i'd learned he lived now, and there was a new building being constructed-- it dwarfed all the others, not just in height (it surpassed the blanket of the clouds), but in width;
the space below felt like a city of its own 
and i said something about the freedom of space, of being able to run; to run and not worry about running into traffic. 
and i don't know why this thought makes me cry.

in the dream, i had school the next day, and somehow woke up, within the dream, on time, checking my phone to see i'd got the last train back at 23:27 
and on my way to school, which somehow, took me back through london, just to the edge of that city-within-a-city; where a terribly cluttered shop, so cluttered i could barely walk inside, housed a shopkeeper with three dogs. and all of them were happy to see me; but all of them trying to leave

and i'd found myself holding each of them back, at the request of the shopkeeper. he didn't want to lose his only company

and once my friend, a secondary school friend this time, had obtained the object he needed, we'd eventually found ourselves at the next school i'd once found myself at

and in the dream he told me i was the first one there.

in the dream, past this point, or perhaps before which was the same, i'd found myself in this spanish speaking town, 

before I knew it, in the dream, i was in a dream within it. 
i was in a bed inside a coffee shop, dreaming 
and the other group, arriving later to this town i just cannot place in the waking earth; 
they told me i needed to wake up, eat something
and i was paralysed, i was paralysed in sleep in dream paralysis, again
surrounded by other people drinking coffee and eating biscuits, in the midst of them i lay beneath a duvet in a double bed alone -- i could barely lift my head


somehow i managed, eventually
and made my way to the square, where my friends had gathered to welcome the others
they had brought {REDACTED} with them. --dear god, please, i just wish they could be {REDACTED}, could stop being the person behind {REDACTED}
i want to let them go like they did me. 

but they were looking over their own wall, above me, looking down onto the teeth and mouth and tongue i had become, 
screaming at the others, asking why they had invited them. 
invited them both--
and then in the dream my sister had offered to drive us somewhere, 
somewhere in this town of cobblestone and forever twilight -- god, it was so beautiful, and walls were everywhere. 
my sister and i had stopped at such a wall, parked on one of the roads we had been barrelling down in a car we could barely drive. i peered over the pebbledashed off-white wall to see even the beaches, even the beaches were separated by walls, hardly even spaced out. little tongues of sea licking little gums of sand and little jutting broken teeth of rocks. 

i offered to lift her so she could see, but i never got the chance to answer. 

in the dream, we were all suddenly playing an augmented reality game, asked to shoot each other with these strange laser guns, gaining points, and they were winning; they were winning-- but i had the will of survival, the will to survive found only in a survivor 
and i shot them, i shot them twice and won the game, somewhere in this town in this dream in this dream somehow i won
in the dream i didn't make my way back home but found myself trying to pull myself up over the wall of gravity, like i had in that bed, being offered food and told to eat, and being told how much help my body needed, how much helping my body would help me wake-
and in the world i live i found myself trying to peer over this pebbledashed wall of gravity 
that separates me from the ocean of my dreaming, breathing in and out of mouth, over bleeding gums and glossy teeth 
in the world i live, as a dream, where somehow i eventually managed to pull myself into, once more 
where then i fed my child the food i did not feed myself 
and sat down to write, to try to travel back
in a car i cannot drive. 
somewhere in the dream, i was travelling
