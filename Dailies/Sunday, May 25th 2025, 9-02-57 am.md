## LAST NIGHT'S DREAM

in the dream, i was a child again. 
Again, I was a child, in the dream. 
And as a child, care-free, my dreams were small 
And I, small again, dreamed i could be free, with the other children I once cared for
Forbearing not, I had not planned, but happened to be sharing with my friends for a small get-together 
And letting them in one by one, then two by two, then four by six by twelve
My father gone, and in his place, my Mother with another 
Father of my friend, my oldest friend, not by time but timeline
And I was happy with my friends, dancing in that small, small room 
The bedroom where, at one point, all points, converging into reading
Reading into dreaming, waking up to write small words, that grew into a cancer 
A cancer of insistence of my Stories on Becoming 
Becoming Story, lie, a lyre, I laid inside so many books, got lost inside them 

The mirrors of my youth, refracting lenses of Becoming 
Reflecting on this dream, my dreams of childhood and my longing 
I was the Starting of a Song so wrongly Strangled into Silence 
And Shrunk, and head-shrunk, life-sapped, crest-fallen on word-swords and other S-words 

And the bedroom of the child I was, the bookcase that had floated as a dagger o'er my dreaming
still held the books now gone and given to some unknown soul, i hope, or worse, rotting in a landfill 
Relinquished 
reliquaries


And the music of the child I was, the CD floating shelf that held the Songs I wished I was, and tried to write, but couldn't fit the words I'd birthed, with worse, the melodies that burst out from my heart like beaten bulbs, and pulses, insects

none of this would fit together

in the dream, i was the child I am, 

the piece of plastic I'd become

splintered off the corner 
of a poorly mixed cassette tape 

I am the child and children I'd not planned to host 
a party of a part 
a colony of parasites

And this palimpsest 
	of palimpsest, 
								partition,
 impression of my father, 
 an Othering another's
Heard my music, played by us, on a small, small, CD player 
that tapping on my chamber door just made my heart swell louder 
And turned it up, Become the loudness, that I did, I turned it up turned up into my Becoming
He shouted over all the joy of racket, batting down the basement hatch I'd shrivelled into
And battled down the door and entered, 
And screamed I was not welcome 
And then my friends were filtered out
Bacteria, Breath, now done with
But I was left there, in the mess 
to deal with cards I'm dealt with 

in the dream, knot-Father told me I was to leave the bedroom 
and leave the hall and down the stairs and out the door and past the pebble-dashing 

with screaming Urgency he told me that I was to sleep on the street, as if my unplanned gathering, was a murder of a child,
and crowing thrice his sharpest sentence he gave me barely any time to collect my things
for some semblance of a warmness round my exile 

He shouted down the stairs, now in my sister's bedroom, or the top-floor bathroom, to my Mother asking
If I'd gone yet, or if he needed to come down and force my exit 


And then she came in, and I'd hoped, 
that futile hope that has now died, but still survived, 
in my dream I still housed a hope of better 
of betterment that I may bring the world, my Self, 
in the long since broken promise of adulthood 


and in the dream my mother, at my doorway, did not help me 
she screamed much louder than the stranger in my childhood home 
where once I'd dreamed in books and songs of artists as a dreamer 
dreaming of the the art I'd make, for belief's sake, 
but my mother left, and in the dream, insisted on my leaving 
screaming 

again, a child, a dream, 
now woken from 
i was a child 


i am
