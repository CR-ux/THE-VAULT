in the dream, i was visited by an angel. 
It was a wheel, within a wheel, within a wheel 
And it skirted, round, around the moon. 
It had the appearance of magnetic tape, 
And as I looked up at the moon, I saw it. Over a tennis court, like the one I'd spent so many moons skating inside-

It silently traveled down, no thought of gravity;

and the person I was with, a sex worker, like I was, but much, much older than me,
they were terrified; and did not see the same thing I did. 

It glided into a position nearer to me, as I walked outside, to the protests of the other human.

I kept reassuring them that it was safe; surely, it was safe, it was just so beautiful, so free--

And it wanted me to see it-

It had the appearance of a gyroscope 
made of magnetic tape 
Which glistened and reflected the moonlight, dazzlingly 

At least for me, this is how She appeared 

And the rings cycling within themselves, once she'd made her way so quickly, smoothly down to earth;

they split, and re-annealed, forming countless objects and animals of the Earth, as if showing us the art we lived inside;

Whether angel or alien, she was, no doubt, of extra terrestrial origin;
and waking to this world I am sure that she was a visitor, not component, of my dream. 

And this is why the other subjects of my dream were terrified;

But something in me, the me who listens, watches, only in my dreams

Was ready for her to show herself.

She formed a shark, a teepee, God, I wish I could remember all the things she formed, but I suppose that does not matter;

What matters was the matter she tried so hard to let us know she was aware of. 

Not some unknowing, greater thing, but an observer, 
An observer of observers, 
A lover of lovers, an artist admiring the art of this Earth

And she was dancing, as I laughed, tearfully rapt, and wrapped her armless shimmering shapes around me, dancing-

all I could do was thank her with my heart, again, again, thank you, dear angel, thank you, for this beauty-- for seeing mine;

And as a group of others arrived, she scurried off to the right, to the break in the wire fence, 

And took the form of a little girl 
In a bear onesie 
With a schoolbag
