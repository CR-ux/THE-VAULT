## LAST NIGHT'S DREAM

in the dream, i was within a dream
within a dream
and, as often seems to be the case lately, it was very, very difficult to wake.
in the dream, i encountered multiple figures from the past, who i do not see anymore. 
perhaps the most significant being Dani, my ex boyfriend, who was the main restrictive force preventing my transition, my evolution into authenticity. 
he, in many ways, represented both a prison, and a freedom. 
in that small house on Michaelmas road, in Coventry
that place to which i will never return 
looking every morning at that face, to whom i will never return 
never knowing how he is, what he is doing, if he is even alive anymore 
and as i sit here on the floor, having pulled these cards of opposites, my body knows why. Somehow. 

in the dream, Dani had, very recently, got a tattoo on his torso
it was a deep black, a depiction of a whip, with a spider on its right side, as if traversing it like a climbing rope, or a web of its own spinning. 
it was absolutely beautiful, 
but a symbol of our distance - he hadn't told me about getting it, or wanting to get it
in the dream, Dani told me, matter-of-factly, that "of course" there was a very real chance he would sleep with his friend, and in that regularly-absurd illogical framework of the dreamspace, i knew this was a form of retaliation. 
i muttered something, in resentment, about polyamory, and going back to that time in our relationship, so fraught with fear, and doubt of our love for one another. 

and now, i think about this same fear, amplified, in the form of my most recent abusive relationship with barnabie. secondary. always secondary. and i am so sick of coming back, to that place i always seem to return, screaming and shaking my head and whispering 'fuck you' under my breath - i wish i could let go of this burning stone. 


in the dream, we were in a facsimile of my current flat, but instead of the stove, there was an impossible window; which led out to the same view as in the opposite direction. i remember stating to Dani "what? there's a new window here?" and him offering no explanation. this could have provided a real signifier of my being within a dream; but then again, similarly, and even more absurd occurences litter my 'waking' life; so why should it, really.

in the dream, i fell asleep, and dreamed. 
in this next layer, i was in another hybrid-facsimile-palimpsest of residence, a shared house, in which i lived with Rosie, an office-mate i had at The Roslin. She was a sort of symbol of distant friendship; somebody i don't particularly miss, but i was fond of during my time there. she was my first source of a tether, to that most unwelcoming and strange world of scientific research, in such an intimidating space. 

and like bicycle stabilisers, she was to be replaced, alighted by a certain sense of levitation, of unthinkable maturity;


but in the dream, within the dream, 
i was sleeping, and half-waking, into this edinburgh flat; my bedroom a living space, which resembled my current bedroom, a triple bay window, with its blackout blinds of pure white, blocking out any light which may have awoken me from that groggy state.

we had ordered fast food, and were eating together, but at some point she had disappeared, much like she has from my life. and inside the box of food she had left a huge pile of uneaten fries. 

i received a text from amanda palmer, stating that she would be over later, and this struck within me a sense of panic, as i realised how messy the place was. 

we started a text conversation about Philomela, linked deeply to my performance piece, IF ONLY HANDS COULD SPEAK--

and in my mentioning of this minor-- yet, for me, so weighted and significant-- mythological figure with her tongue severed, rendering her speechless, censored, she replied 

*So therefore, listening.*

at some point I had managed to drag my consciousness from this layer, waking up somehow in the same space, in that triple-bay-window bedroom, which was now mine, not communal, but i was alone, realising that the conversation with amanda had not happened. 

and the dream layer previously above, with Dani, was not there, but dissipated, merged into this one; approaching what we call the "real world". The Reel World. 

And recalling this dream, I am reminded of the many, many nested fractal dreams that have littered my sleep lately, how they have been occurring through progressively chronological spaces, always houses, always places I have lived, but with a chimeric quality- mixing symbols of various places I have laid my restless, dreaming, half-waking head. 

And the people I once called family, morphing into people I once called lovers, morphing into people I once called friends, to land here--

in this space, alone. 

and one of these dreams phases back to me like anaesthesia before my first surgery; in which i had a dog, a Beagle, and he got on so well with my Ferret, my familiar, but I had worried so much that I could not take care of them both, these wards of protection, which I was sworn to protect, insufficient. Not enough. Walking up the stairs of my childhood home, to my parents bedroom, to dream another dream, within that one.

perhaps the most important strikes back to me like a lightning bolt; stunning, terrifying--
in which i was not alone, like here, save for my familiar, but in a space with him, that I could not name, but perhaps resembled the place I grew up in, cotton sofas of a disgusting hue; 

and with me was a male figure, and a female figure, discussing the process of enlightenment, of spiritual growth. The paradoxical nowness that travels through time; 

and they were talking amongst themselves, while indirectly talking to me, 
while i flipped through the pages of a notebook, a sketchbook,
each page of which seemed to correspond to a stage of spiritual evolution--
and each one, filled completely, i remember- i remember knowing that each one had been filled to the point of saturation 
i remember knowing that these pages were my own, and that they represented and confirmed the work i have done, across each of these unthinkably interconnected, and equally non-fictional {{meta}|physical} rooms. 

but one page, perhaps the sixth, perhaps the penultimate, was torn out, missing. 
yet the last page had begun to be written upon.
in the same medium with which i scrawled the beginnings of these hellish murals, which are now to cause my eviction from this latest place I have dreamed. 

and I knew, within the dream, within that dream, within this dream we call life; 
i knew what this meant. i knew that it meant something, or someone, or all of the someones i have thought to be *the* one, had torn out the final straight of my marathon towards whatever it means to be 'complete'.

but still, i was, and have been, and still am, a solider of the pen;
violently pressing my pigment into the skin of the page; like i once dragged a sharpener blade, stomped out of its plastic and screw, on my school playground concrete, to drag against the softness of the arm of the child i was, as some silly sense of armour

this last page, the words upon it i could barely read; but when tilted properly towards the light, i could sense their shape, the size and capitalisation of the letters, a reaching of a casing in the closed, then opened, then closed and ripped open case of my heart;

i knew exactly what this meant, in the dream





still, half-paralysed, 
barely awake, 
trying to climb this ladder of sleep,
this ladder I know upon which 
I have still not reached the top rung.
