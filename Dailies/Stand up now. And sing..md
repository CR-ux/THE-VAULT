in the dream, i was 
in primary school{REDACTED}
Where
Everything seemed so small. 

As I write the recall of this dream and try to sift through its fog,
I realise that my School, St. John's, had a Coat of Arms 
Depicting a lamb, a little lamb, laid down; in a position of hypnogogia
Holding a flag--
{REDACTED}
Where I would squat down, not on all fours, like I was in the boys' bathroom behind me, past the scaffold, having the shit, the mangled remains of the packed lunch my Mother made, wiped off my ass by an angry, angry, adult woman- a teaching assistant, who even now, I believe simply detested me, for the flower of womanhood that was budding inside me; 

*{Where in this cruelly unreal, waking and nightmarish world, back then, she would leave the cubicle door open, perhaps for her great size being unable to fit inside a little child's flimsy metal defecation Bothy, and the boys, not like I was, would be running in, and out to call in all the others of my class, so they could point and laugh, at the accident I was; {REDACTED}for reasons I simply didn't understand, for reasons apparently not important or telling enough for my parents to realise I was autistic; and the woman,{REDACTED}would be sputtering, sickened to the depths of the void of where her soul may have once been:

"You're *disgusting.* *You're absolutely disgusting.*"


but steady Now, on two feet; evolved--
I crouched down, clean, 
And I regarded how small this place was, 
How I dwarfed the chairs stacked up in structures either side of me, 
Where the two female figures stood, regarding me in turn. 


Where there was a giant Bee, a parade float of a Bee, 
Rolling around the assembly hall, as a Choir of girls rehearsed their performance. 

Where a teacher, a facsimile of the Teacher, {REDACTED} 
Who encouraged me to follow the song of my heart, 
Would be throwing his body in front of the float and diverting it from running over the children. 

The floors were still as polished, smooth, and reflective as they'd always been, A mirror, as I'd always remembered, looking down into them as I sang the morning Hymn, 

Not Him, but Hymn, 

A burned, browned Daffodil, I so desperately wished would turn into a Rose.[^af]
