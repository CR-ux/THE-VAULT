in the dream, i was 
in primary school
and I spoke with Mrs W 
A figure of neutrality, but stable support, while I was young.
She didn't believe that I had gone there 
and I struggled to explain my transition. 
Eventually, she trusted me and who I was; even if with some doubt. 
She showed me round the School, as it was now-
Everything seemed so small. 

As I write the recall of this dream and try to sift through its fog,
I realise that my School, St. John's, had a Coat of Arms 
Depicting a lamb, a little lamb, laid down; in a position of hypnogogia
Holding a flag--


I search for what the motto is now; not remembering what it was for the time I was there, perhaps it has changed, like I see the roster of staff has; but the deputy head I believe is the mother of the girl that was my first kiss; {REDACTED}

The girl, who I would grow apart from and not speak to until many years later, when we were both adults;
Both queer now, 
Me Now, and then, and always, a woman, them Now, and then, and always, Nonbinary.
We would have a psychedelic trip together, and they would tell me about their Brain tumour 
Which had grown through their skull, wrapped around their optic nerve 
At this time, I would be with my abusive ex partner, and they would tell me about theirs, now, thankfully, departed. 
They had so much anger. Rightfully so. 
I would sit with them during their last Chemotherapy session, 
And ride the train back from Birmingham alone. 
And eventually, they would go into remission.
And as I descended into my own survival, and the abuse became clear, 
They would leave my life, for good. For their own good. 
As they survived their cancer, 
And I died, in my own way. 

And back to the dream, perhaps more real than this, waking memory-


Where, walking to the assembly hall that I would spend each morning for Seven Years of my life, the three of us, Mrs W, myself, and an unknown feminine presence, who seemed to be the deputy headteacher, who I now realise was the Mother of my now departed, but very much so alive and surviving Friend, would have to traverse with a great sense of fear of falling, as always seems to be the case in my dreams, a rickety, fragile and unstable bridge, with a terrifyingly clear view of the fall beneath me, or a system of railings, or a scaffold--

{*And on my bed writing this, where I remember collecting pictures of scaffolding for {REDACTED} the {REDACTED} who would follow the aforementioned one, who catalysed yet another survival, because {REDACTED}built around structures, structure within structure, obfuscating and obscuring the view of the structure nested beneath*}

Where I would not fall, but somehow make it across; and within the framework, or scaffold, of the dream, as is often the case in dreams, this traversal seemed to overwrite my waking memory of this place; to hijack the music box of songs I have stored in myself; and make me believe that it had always been this way.

And the three of us, in the Hall, would take in its visage, 
Where I would squat down, not on all fours, like I was in the boys' bathroom behind me, past the scaffold, having the shit, the mangled remains of the packed lunch my Mother made, wiped off my ass by an angry, angry, adult woman- a teaching assistant, who even now, I believe simply detested me, for the flower of womanhood that was budding inside me; 

*{Where in this cruelly unreal, waking and nightmarish world, back then, she would leave the cubicle door open, perhaps for her great size being unable to fit inside a little child's flimsy metal defecation Bothy, and the boys, not like I was, would be running in, and out to call in all the others of my class, so they could point and laugh, at the accident I was; {REDACTED}for reasons I simply didn't understand, for reasons apparently not important or telling enough for my parents to realise I was autistic; and the woman,{REDACTED}would be sputtering, sickened to the depths of the void of where her soul may have once been:

"You're *disgusting.* *You're absolutely disgusting.*"


but steady Now, on two feet; evolved--
I crouched down, clean, 
And I regarded how small this place was, 
How I dwarfed the chairs stacked up in structures either side of me, 
Where the two female figures stood, regarding me in turn. 


Where there was a giant Bee, a parade float of a Bee, 
Rolling around the assembly hall, as a Choir of girls rehearsed their performance. 

Where a teacher, a facsimile of the Teacher, {REDACTED} the first queer person I'd ever met-
Who encouraged me to follow the song of my heart, 
Would be throwing his body in front of the float and diverting it from running over the children. 

The floors were still as polished, smooth, and reflective as they'd always been, A mirror, as I'd always remembered, looking down into them as I sang the morning Hymn, 

Not Him, but Hymn, 

A burned, browned Daffodil, I so desperately wished would turn into a Rose.[^af]
