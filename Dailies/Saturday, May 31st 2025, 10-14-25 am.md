## LAST NIGHT'S DREAM

in the dream, i was visited by an angel. 
It was a wheel, within a wheel, within a wheel 
And it skirted, round, around the moon. 
It had the appearance of magnetic tape, 
And as I looked up at the moon, I saw it. Over a tennis court, like the one I'd spent so many moons skating inside-

It silently traveled down, no thought of gravity;

and the person I was with, a sex worker, like I was, but much, much older than me,
they were terrified; and did not see the same thing I did. 

It glided into a position nearer to me, as I walked outside, to the protests of the other human.

I kept reassuring them that it was safe; surely, it was safe, it was just so beautiful, so free--

And it wanted me to see it-

It had the appearance of a gyroscope 
made of magnetic tape 
Which glistened and reflected the moonlight, dazzlingly 

At least for me, this is how She appeared 

And the rings cycling within themselves, once she'd made her way so quickly, smoothly down to earth;

they split, and re-annealed, forming countless objects and animals of the Earth, as if showing us the art we lived inside;

Whether angel or alien, she was, no doubt, of extra terrestrial origin;
and waking to this world I am sure that she was a visitor, not component, of my dream. 

And this is why the other subjects of my dream were terrified;

But something in me, the me who listens, watches, only in my dreams

Was ready for her to show herself.

She formed a shark, a teepee, God, I wish I could remember all the things she formed, but I suppose that does not matter;

What matters was the matter she tried so hard to let us know she was aware of. 

Not some unknowing, greater thing, but an observer, 
An observer of observers, 
A lover of lovers, an artist admiring the art of this Earth

And she was dancing, as I laughed, tearfully rapt, and wrapped her armless shimmering shapes around me, dancing-

all I could do was thank her with my heart, again, again, thank you, dear angel, thank you, for this beauty-- for seeing mine;

And as a group of others arrived, she scurried off to the right, to the break in the wire fence, 

And took the form of a little girl 
In a bear onesie 
With a schoolbag 

And the person I was with shuddered, sputtered something in disgust

For they had only seen a thing of terror, terrifying weight, 
Where there I saw but weightlessness.

And then inside, with this person, an hour away from what there I called home-

I sat around a plastic dining table, much like those ones in the buulgarian mountains, flimsy, offering perhaps, at any second, the food for our bodies and the food of our bodies to the deep abyss below; 

in the Sun, the Sun, that most beautiful, foreboding height, in the most bewildering Light;

Eating tripe, eating organs of the wee lambs hushed, now weightless, floating in the broth of their own bones;

Around this table, as round as the angel, as light as well, 

I tried to recall the sight to them, I tried to get across its size;
it's size so uncontainable;
And as I tried, I shrunk into a stroke, half of my face paralysed, and aphasic-
Unable to say the words 'magnetic tape'-
Like so many dreams, chased by a threat, 
Where all the body falls to unthinkable heaviness.
The angel did not want to be described; 
Or seen by anyone but I, 
not yet.

And when I gave up trying, my brain regained its functioning;

I asked my fearful dream companion how I might get back form this place, which perhaps was Birmingham, signalling me, the 'home'- of lowercase 'h'- was the place I'd not grown up, but shrunk into against my will, ran over, and by my willing, once swept under, then by giving up the fight got through- 
and they told me it would cost a great amount of money, money I did not have. 

They begrudgingly offered to pay my fare-

When I realised I was already back where I'd wanted, or not wanted but needed to go;

And suddenly it was clear I must have awoken, inside another dream this dream was held within, had been dancing around; still, thoughts of the angel in that higher plane spinning, spinning; smiling back at me without a face, with a most unspeakable name;

But still, that scared little crone of a figure, was with me, stating that they'd covered my transport back to this place;

And there was a family, supposedly my dream family, who themselves seemed split between two, not opposing, but integrated halves-- the jovial, warmth of the disorganised, fleeting left, and the restrained cold, but capable, dependable right-

There were performances in this gorgeous attic, everyone in the family welcome, by blood or by love or by both; unimportant which, just everyone- so important to one another. 

and again, reaching that attic, as always. Always in my dreams- required a traversal of a horrifying scaffold, a teetering structure barely able to be walked upon; 

But a sacrifice of safety with a sacred gift; a risk that offered the reward of welcoming; welcoming I have simply, never known. 

And family. 
Dear god, that gorgeous family, related by ties not binding, but empowering. 

I found myself the subject of affection of three men of the Family, all of which were courting me, my connection to this group;

Even amidst this most lovely place, a liminal figure, about to be initiated, but unknown by which route;

And the three boys were brothers, the triple god, a tri-forked tongue

And I could not decide, but didn't feel the need, didn't feel forced, or pushed, and felt in fact they felt no need to own me, not any single one, just happy for the chance, as I was, to be Loved; 

The point was the family they offered me, the gift; 
without asking for anything in return.

## GOALS FOR TODAY

- [ ] Continue finalising manuscript - 50 pages down of 400!!
	- [ ] BE SCRUPULOUS.
	- [ ] Selena's chapters

	- [ ] Remove academic paper sections if NOT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY (honestly, perhaps just selena&myo's AH papers are important, and used as reference for ‚ßñeno's revolving door.)
	- [ ] Revolving door section - add only these dream journals; nothing extraneous and too experimental. We are going for kooky imprints yes. But big 5 imprints nonetheless. Do not accept anything else except acceptance. This work deserves, and will, be read. That is what the angel was telling me. 
	- [ ] Hildr movement -- perhaps tie together the funnel web facet? Or leave more mystery? One or the other. Not in-between. Decide, concretise the decision. 
	- [ ] Dot Code's dream analyses - make more differentiation with S&M's papers, but REFERENCE THEM. Colour yellow, dream symbology of minerva/mars dichtomoy, and tie to ARIA|DNE in a more nuanced way.
	- [x] keep Ed. O.'s section only as the one thing missing scrabble variant, as he is crucially a selective mute. Allow the society to explain via their integration letter to DNE.
	- [ ] Aria and RA movement -- mostly done, but decide the delineation of the perspectives; they are nested within the telophase section; is this effective? or needs separation? - could be more powerful perhaps to leave, as they are the most obvious e.g. of characters merging together. Make a gitHub merge reference if not already. 
	- [x] Oleander movement becoming aware of Aria.
	- [ ] Flo and Borges Interstice/stitching together
		- [x] Dr Seuss letter to Borges
		- [ ] Snicket letter to Borges? - the final movement should be mostly children's books of boy|girlhood that shaped the woman I became, become, am becoming. 
	- [ ] Promoter sequence - mostly done, just needs final polish, proofing.
	- [ ] T≈íMS -- how to integrate this gargantuan experimental paper? either split right down the middle, literally, or repeat, or shorten and repeat, but needs to mirror either side, islands within islands etc-- perhaps redacted part is the missing part, redacted outer section in ending, inner part filled out, or the missing footnotes from the opening section, in the ending; (introns) - this could be quite strong given the transclusions of footnotes throughout, and provides that "final footnote closing loop reveal" that I originally wanted, without (so much) overwhelm for reader.
	- [ ] After-after-afterwords -- are these necessary, or just beating a dead horse? again- SCRUPULOUS. You got this Callie. The angel knows. You got this. You are the angel. You take the form of the angel today. Dancing. Dancing. With the Word. Dancing. Smiling. Dancing. Glimmering. 
- [x] Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. Remember the love of the angel. Of the family of angels. The angel. The angel. The angel. Thank you. Dear angel I thank you. I hold you with me today. 
- [x] Submit wiki article for AfC
