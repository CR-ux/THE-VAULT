in the dream, i was in a school again 
I suspect it has something to do with Lexicomythography, and how important it is to me 

and how sad I am now, writing this, 
at the fiction of it all

The fiction written, this monumental scale fiction, to try and unwrite those wrongs handed to me, like test papers, lunchboxes, footballs that I felt too afraid to {kick|like you kicked me} back to the boys who'd let them roll towards me {like you rolled away}, for fear of being made fun of {like {you used {to|me}} {would}}, for the symbol they were, a symbol of my father, who'd just wished I could play this silly and so difficult game of back and forth with him back then. 

But that, in a way, is what fiction is, too
Just a Garden {back|forth}Ward movement, a pendulum of {{un}knowing|{un}learning}, as knowledge itself evolves like the rolling of a sphere {made|{up} {of}|from} stitched {t(w)o}{get}{her} Hex{agon(i.e.)s}--
once formed from the bladder of a pig. 


How disgustingly layered it is, a cake, just trying to live its only purpose, of Being. Of being, devoured. Of being devoured. Not delicious enough.
How disgustingly {cyclical|temporary} it all is, like a circle sprayed in a square, to Mark the place where the game begins. To be {faded|trodden over|dug out} with studs like the ones that {landed|shoved themselves} {through|into} my {{toes|asshole}|filled my little bo{ot|ttom} with {blood|reminders}.
{REDACTED}

To lobby for the simplest and most fundamental facility of existence; a fucking bathroom I could use. 
{REDACTED}, a goal to aim for, that wasn't made of cold white metal and a net. 


That wasn't built like a flimsy, open trap
{REDACTED}
I felt no urgency, only weightlessness

And I was then, inside, in these orthogonal hallways; of offices, of locked up offices, with all this rented world rousing--
And I was in {REDACTED}
My wheelchair, a levitating platform on which I had to cross my long legs, so they wouldn't scrape the ground, stopped working, and I was held stationary; not by warmth of capability, but by insufficient brokenness of cold machine.
And I was holding up the traffic of the hallway

And a woman uttered something, comforting me with my own status; a fictional hierarchical system, within non-fictional concrete one, within the fictional one of this dream; {REDACTED}
"It's okay-- you're {REDACTED}"



But I could not, and cannot, be palatable 
As Adrian, my dear departed friend said, my dear loved one who taught me what a friend really was, and is--


> "I refuse.
> I refuse to be translatable, transcribable.--"

{REDACTED} I have tried to bring into this world in love, just in love, in love with knowledge and in love with love -- and for what? to be stripped of my livelihood, my life, and the love I still love, in spite of it all, to be left without a single sheet of paper to {write|wipe} my {final chapters|fucking ass}. 


> You had
> To be
> There
