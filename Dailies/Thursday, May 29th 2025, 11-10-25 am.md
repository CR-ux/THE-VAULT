## LAST NIGHT'S DREAM

in the dream, i was in a school again 
or in some sort of representation of a school, in a vast academy of red brick and grey stone 
and why is it that so many forgotten figures of my youth decide to rear their heads in my subconscious of late- too late, somehow 
{REDACTED} and {REDACTED} Freemantle, and {REDACTED} Sweet - three girls, two of them twins, all of them misgendered me, spoke with such disdain, the latter being one I'd once called my best friend, the one who outed me, that catalysed the bullying that hung around my ears like the temporary deafness left by teenage boys that would attack me on the walk home, when my father didn't come to pick me up, and the boys filled my ears with snow, and for all those hidden breaktimes in the practice rooms, I couldn't hear my own piano.
There was a giant cake, disgusting, but it looked appealing, unlike the Rascally cake, which pervaded my thoughts as a child, and terrified me, and made me unable to leave my toes exposed at night 
It looked delicious, with spherical icing filled with ice cream 
And everybody was telling me how horrible it was, it lay on the floor, chipped away at in the corner of the classroom 
But I decided to try it anyway, to see for myself, and confirmed how bad it was. 

There was a moment of attempted conflict resolution, by a female teacher, on a garden bench at the back of the classroom, 
And while the girls pretended to come to some sort of peace with me, later they would confirm just how little they'd learned 

Eventually, I was in London again, in what seemed like a continuation of an earlier dream from this week, where I'd managed to sneak my way into a Theme Park, a place in honour of JK Rowling- without being noticed, until I tried to help another girl, cisgender, who didn't quite understand how to stay under the radar. 

But this dream, in this sequel, I was some sort of famous. 
I was walking around with Matt Lucas, through a hedgerow labyrinth, or rather, over it, somehow-
And he was talking about his trepidation around being out in public
And we stumbled across a mass funeral, graves placed in this strange glass building, all stacked in orderly rows like some sort of furniture warehouse for parts that no longer had a use. 
And the mourners, queueing, calmy, to leave their flowers. 

And then suddenly the three aforementioned girls were with us, and were stealing bunches of flowers from other graves, to give to the mourners of others; who accepted them gratefully, not realising from where they'd come. And I was disgusted, and I left. 

Walking uphill, in a London park, with this eccentric figure from British comedy, far outdated now, one which hasn't at all aged well- was perhaps as transphobic as the girls featuring alongside him in the dream;

These girls featuring in my waking life, at a time where I'd hated myself enough to keep them around, assuming they were the best suggestion of the word 'friend' I would ever get. 

We came across a log flume in the park, right in the middle of it, water spilling from its sides, reminding me of those joy filled times in West Midlands Safari Park, where I'd wish we could skip the whole safari part, feeling so sad for the animals, and just wanting to put my *self* in restraints, to feel the drop in my stomach, to fall, to fall, to fall; giggling, replacing all the stolen laughter from the times I should have been laughing at school. 

Why is school, or these environments of formal education, these gatherings of humans specifically centred around the acquisition of knowledge, and its accompanying fear, such gripping fear, such subjugation, in spite of my excelling in the facet for which we were there, recurring so much lately?

I suspect it has something to do with Lexicomythography, and how important it is to me 

and how sad I am now, writing this, 
at the fiction of it all

The fiction written, this monumental scale fiction, to try and unwrite those wrongs handed to me, like test papers, lunchboxes, footballs that I felt too afraid to kick back to the boys who'd let them roll towards me, for fear of being made fun of, for the symbol they were, a symbol of my father, who'd just wished I could play this silly game of back and forth with him. 

But that, in a way, is what fiction is, too
Just a back and forth movement, a pendulum of knowing, unknowing, learning, unlearning, as knowledge itself evolves like the rolling of a sphere made of stitches together hexagons--
once formed from the bladder of a pig. 


How disgustingly layered it is, like a Rascally cake, just trying to live its only purpose, of being, of being devoured.
How disgustingly cyclical and temporary it all is, like a circle sprayed in the middle of a square, to mark the place where the game begins. To be faded, trodden over, dug out with studs like the ones that landed through my toes and filled my boot with blood.


And then I had phased somehow back to the grand academy, where I saw my senior professor from my time at The Roslin Institute, 
Where I'd felt like nothing but an impostor, and tried to leverage my queerness to show I was somehow worth something. 

To lobby for the simplest and most fundamental facility of existence; a fucking bathroom I could use. 

And parade this as something to be awarded, something I did indeed win an award for; a star-shaped glass, heavy, heavy thing; 
Which sat upon the shelf above my desk, and was left, when I left the Institute before I could finish my PhD-- knowing I was made to be an artist, and I was done with all this hiding, this stirring and baking in a cubic stove and slicing into layers of specific colours and layering on top of one another in a precise order, and covering with a sugared substance, luring potential devourers to my artifice of vanilla essence-

In this redbrick place, I saw my professor, one Paul Digard, such an accomplished virologist 
And he, in the dream, held me in such high regard 
And the hall, our place of work we found ourselves in, was the glossy polished floor of my primary school, a mirror. 
And he hugged me, so tightly, and held me so close to him, and I remember, so clearly, feeling so, so safe. 
He was so tall. 

I was almost crying from how safe he made me feel with his tallness, with his warmth, with the warmth of his intellect; this idea of paternity, for once grounded in a sense of what I called important, a goal to look up to, a goal to aim for, that wasn't made of cold white metal and a net. 



That wasn't built like a flimsy, open trap


And he asked me to get something from another department, perhaps immunology, and I gladly obliged, once the embrace had ended
And suddenly, there they were, on the journey to this unknown place, through this dizzying system of playground fields of concrete, 
And this maze of hallways; 
Which themselves resembled those playgrounds littered with my broken sharpeners, alighted of their blades, my collection of some semblance, of physical proof of the pain I was going through, about which nobody seemed to care-- my armoire against myself;
And each step, my mass shrunk, and shrunk, until it seemed to hold no thought for gravity;
I was floating uncontrollably, needing the help of these so-called friends to bring me back to the Earth again, so I could carry out the mission handed to me by my dream's idol

It was not scary, it was interesting. 
It was funny, somehow;
I felt no urgency, only weightlessness

And I was then, inside, in these orthogonal hallways; of offices, of locked up offices, with all this rented world rousing--
And I was in an electric wheelchair; which seemed to navigate my path automatically;

My wheelchair, a levitating platform on which I had to cross my long legs, so they wouldn't scrape the ground, stopped working, and I was held stationary; not by warmth of capability, but by insufficient brokenness of cold machine.
And I was holding up the traffic of the hallway

And a woman uttered something, comforting me with my own status; a fictional hierarchical system, within non-fictional concrete one, within the fictional one of this dream;
She told me the category of students, researchers in which I had been placed, once I realised I'd not booked an appointment for entry into this other department
And the other girls weren't there anymore; I was locked safely within this system, of systems, of system--


And she said 
"It's okay-- you're a Visionary"



But I could not, and cannot, be palatable 
As Adrian, my dear departed friend said, my dear loved one who taught me what a friend really was, and is--


> "I refuse.
> I refuse to be translatable, transcribable.--"


and my walls, just absolutely saturated with these genuinely goya-esque oil works, everywhere, that are causing my eviction, I feel so unsafe from the safety I've tried to build, and I'm just lamenting, lamenting and so full of this grief, this horrendous disgustingly unpalatable grief, that has permeated and pervaded my entire goddamn life. The work, this insect, this insect spawning from my heart, tearing open my organs, my body, dislocating my joints and causing me all the agony of the world, raping my body not my own, raping, raping me, to give me what? To give me this drive, this pain-fuel, this fucking, COMPULSION to create this thing never known to me, never ever known to me and just as much not my own as the body I've been placed in -- why? Why? It insists on becoming, it insists on becoming, to try to teach me to become myself; and all these debt letters pouring in, all this debt pouring in; even unable to buy fucking toilet paper; how desperately unfair. To read this wikipedia article, all the gargantuan scope of the things I have tried to bring into this world in love, just in love, in love with knowledge and in love with love -- and for what? to be stripped of my livelihood, my life, and the love I still love, in spite of it all, to be left without a single sheet of paper to wipe my fucking ass.

## GOALS FOR TODAY

- [ ] Condense scattered, verbose manuscript into compiled, agent-ready whole - be scrupulous. Anything not serving central narrative goes. But retain experimental forms to ensure authentic voice of original work. 
- [ ] Submit wikipedia article to AfC, with COI, not disclosing identity. Let it go. 
- [ ] Breathe.
