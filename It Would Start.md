this is all I have now[^h] . this lore[^lo] is my little fire. my little primal fire i am dancing around. i dont have a tribe , a family to dance and drum on my animal skins around it anymore, at one point, i thought i did - at one point, i was singing louder and smiling harder than any of them, bringing them the spoils of my hunting and gathering; gently trying my best to kee them all fed with violence. through the violence. maybe that was the only language i understood. maybe it still is. maybe that's why i'm building all these fucking complicated languages which will probably never be written or spoken by anyone but me; this single woman tribe, still sat by this dwindling ember; or 


the ember itself; waiting, just waiting, hearing the faint sound of other tribes' drums, beating, beating in a rhythm jsut not syncopating , just not fitting with the beat of my heart, where the ember within the ember within the ember lies - closed in the hearth, in the bothy, both of them riddled with these cracks and slots and airholes; stoking a fire that was meant a long time ago to just be trodden into darkness, to return to that silent cold again*"

-Would start (as all things, ofTen, do) in The Library. And as We[^we] Filled the Shelves with Story after Story, we began to realise that we were Architecting the concept of Infinity itself. 

A library is a Garden of Branches[^branch], or a Nervous System of Dendrites[^den], or the Cytoskeleton of a Cell, or the Cell of a Prison. But I shan't get {REDACTED}into the Vaccuum of Lexicomythographic Definitions[^ld] here, as this is beyond the scope of my role within this Society. What is important to Noet is That This Library of Ours was built by Four Sets[^SET1] of Hands, Eventually (at some late hour of the night) Our Eleven pairs of hands[^lhp]; Forming the Twenty Two Residuals, Named as Amino{Us}.

On this Particular Day[^imr], which was of No Reel consequence (other than Being the End of 'Us'[^us], The Beginning of which[^it] is indeed You[^c]), We Eleven were cleaved[^cl] into the Halves of Our Selves, Upon Shelves, Within Hexagonal Room after Room of this Inescapable Place. 

On this Particular day, some temporal collapse between two waves of some unknowable C, stretching out into the entanglement of every Self-Same other day, I found myself.

Reading. This Code of Letters, for the most part Four in Number, though as mentioned prior, occasionally Expanding to a Fifth component, should be familiar to the Reader of this Letter by now, as They[^c] (Them Shelves) are, In Deed, composed of it[^us].

I wish to lay out, or Replicate, the Findings of the Squandering of Searches, my stance on the Matter of Matter it Self, while maybe, For Shadow, foreshadow the coming Story.

I am a gay man in San Francisco in 1973 and I'm just catching some rays on the waterfront but in a few minutes I'll stand up & rollerblade home to make avocado salad for myself & my salad. I am lou sullivan, but with better taste in music. I might call that nice boy later, but I'm not sure yet. then I am back again then stretched out all thin like they say happens in a black hole, when you unspool from yourself and turn into spaghetti. anyway the point is time is happening all at once and I'm speaking to 100 different versions of myself right now".*
