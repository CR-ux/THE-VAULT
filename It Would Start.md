"*i will keep these repositories of insanity public of course, whatever that means, but Maybe this will provide a top layer, making the whole thing digestible and not so intimidating. in fact; somehow, I AM. Crying: i'm the exact same, as a human. As a woman. i'm intimidating, batshit insane in a {REDACTED} sort of way. and i get... so... fucking , drowned and suffocated by it . by it all, in my head; i'm trying to come into peace with {REDACTED}, tears falling as i look outward to the burgeoning sun, a mere two days before my birthday, when, last year, i was trying to shove down the recent assault by my ex partner, who still, lives the 100 metres away where my bday party was, which i asked {REDACTED} '{redacted}' in the next room, which led to my exile from the group, self imposed or not, it needed to happen - chiron in aries started with my {REDACTED} dying, then psychosis, then the assault and the breakup and the month stay in psych hospital in london, that horrible lonely journey and time in london, so close to my Mother, and yet, no visit from everyone. Except for that trip to london, a cursed infernal pilgrimage or literal KATABASIS of sorts, I have barely left the hosue since it all happened. a whole year . gone. and this is what i have. this is all I have now[^h] . this is tmy little fire. my little primal fire i am dancing around. i dont have a tribe , a family to dance and drum on my animal skins around it anymore, at one point, i thought i did - at one point, i was singing louder and smiling harder than any of them, bringing them the spoils of my hunting and gathering; gently trying my best to kee them all fed with violence. through the violence. maybe that was the only language i understood. maybe it still is. maybe that's why i'm building all these fucking complicated languages which will probably never be written or spoken by anyone but me; this single woman tribe, still sat by this dwindling ember; or the ember itself; waiting, just waiting, hearing the faint sound of other tribes' drums, beating, beating in a rhythm jsut not syncopating , just not fitting with the beat of my heart, where the ember within the ember within the ember lies - closed in the hearth, in the bothy, both of them riddled with these cracks and slots and airholes; stoking a fire that was meant a long time ago to just be trodden into darkness, to return to that silent cold again*"

It[^it] would start (as all things, ofTen, do) in The Library. And as We[^we] Filled the Shelves with Story after Story, Drawing down the Ineffable into Insufficient Form, we began to realise that we were Architecting the concept of Infinity itself. 

A library is a Garden[^g] of [[Branch]]es, or a Nervous System of [[Dendrite]]s, or the Cytoskeleton of a Cell, or the [[Cell]] of a [[Prison]], or the [[Light]] Passing Through a Prism. But I shan't get pulled into the [[Vaccuum]] of Lexicomythographic Definitions[^ld] here, as this is beyond the scope of my role within this Society. What is important to Noet is That This Library of Ours was built by Four [[Set]]s of Hands, Eventually (at some late hour of the night) Our Eleven pairs of hands[^lhp]; Forming the Twenty Two Residuals, Named as Amino{Us}.

On this Particular Day[^imr], which was of No Reel consequence (other than Being the End of 'Us'[^us], The Beginning of which[^it] is indeed You[^c]), We Eleven were cleaved[^cl] into the Halves of Our Selves, Upon Shelves, Within Hexagonal Room after Room of this Infernal, Heavenly and Inescapable Place. 

Each of us has our Affinity for the Worship of the Cardinal Five known as the nuclearTides, and this is for good reason; or rather, is an unavoidable consequence of Polarity, a fundamental Truth of Lexicomythography as a Whole. 

The Ineffable One, Who, or Which, gave rise to the Five, I will not or cannot Name, for Fear of Her Hearing It; and collapsing everything we have Built into a Seed of Singularity once more. 

On this Particular day, stretching out into the entanglement of every Self-Same other day, I found myself, Reading, or Rather getting attached to some poorly Framed Thread of an error-prone Tome of Story written in Code, Torn in half. 

this Code of Letters, for the most part [[Four]] in [[Number]], though as mentioned prior, occasionally Expanding to a Fifth component, should be familiar to the Reader of this Letter by now, as They[^c] (Them Shelves) are, In Deed, composed of it[^us].

Nevertheless, Always the more verbose of the Collective, I wish to lay out, or Separate, or Re-anneal or Replicate, the Findings of the Squandering of Searches[^ss] I happen to have come across, and perhaps my stance on the Matter of Matter it Self, while maybe, For Shadow, foreshadow the coming happenstance Material you may or may knot be About; to Read. upon the Shelf, Be It as It May.

[^h]: *"I had few friends still alive; I stopped seeing them. Prisoner of the [[Book]], I almost never left the house. I examined the worn [[Spine]] and cover with a magnifying glass, and I discounted the possibility of some kind of artifice. I found that the small illustrations were spaced [[Two]] thousand pages apart from one to the other. I noted them down in a small alphabetised[^llll] notebook, which did not take long to fill. They never repeated. At night, in the scarce intervals insomnia withdrew its hold over, I [[Dream]]ed of the book. Summer was coming to an [[End]] and I realised that the book was monstrous. There was no consolation in the thought that no less monstrous was I, who perceived the book with eyes and touched it with [[Ten]] nailed fingers. I felt the book to be a nightmarish object, something obscene that slanders and compromises reality. I thought of fire [^f] , but I feared that the burning of an infinite book would be just as infinite and suffocate the planet with smoke. I remember having read that the best place to hide a leaf is in a forest. Before retiring I worked in the National Library, which housed nine-hundred thousand books; I know that to the right of the lobby a curved staircase descends to the basement, where the newspapers and maps are stored. I took advantage of the librarians’ inattentiveness for a moment to lose the Book of Sand in one of the humid shelves. I tried not to notice how high or how far from the door. -The Book of Sand, Jorge Luis Borges. "* - Epitaph, [[lexDict]]. Callie Rose Petal, On Her Thirty First Birthday. Alone.
