*This Universe (which some call the Hospital) is composed of an indefinite and perhaps infinite number of hexagonal rooms, with vastly identical air shafts between, surrounded by walls covered in an indefinite and perhaps infinitely layered wallpaper; ever-remaining a faded yellow hue.* 

*Upon a single sheet of this indefinite and perhaps infinite Hospital wallpaper, 

*perhaps on every sheet of wallpaper,* 
*the following may have been,* 
*or about to be,* 
*written,* 
*in the blood* 
*of no more* 
*than Six individuals* 
*(at any one time):*

YOU ARE IN A SYSTEM OF ~~AT LEAST~~ SIX ROOMS I DO NOT KNOW WHAT BROUGHT YOU HERE BUT I KNOW YOU MUST PASS THIS NOTE ON IF YOU WISH TO STAY HER~~E~~. you will notice the vents only allow for objects such as this scroll to be passed through in one directionality of movement. hence this note being on the left vent as you face your room's door. when tightly rolled sufficiently. there is a labelled folding diagram on the reverse leaf of this wallpaper. it will show you how to ensure the untorn passage of the correspondence through our system 
*you are in a system of ONLY SIX ROOMS. christ the unbearable agony of knowing nothing will ever stay and yet we're doomed to go around and round and become the thing that made us*
YOU ARE IN A SYSTEM OF AT LEAST SIX ROOMS. 
YOU ARE IN A SYSTEM OF AT LEAST SIX ROOMS. DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES READ THIS ALOUD. FOR SHE IS LISTENING
YOU ARE NOT IN A SYSTEM OF SIX ROOMS. 
I AM GETTING OUT OF THIS ROOM. I DO KNOT KNOW WHERE I AM GOING. I DO NOT CARE. I NEED TO GET AWAY FROM YOU ALL~~. I AM DONE WITH THISwe are never getting out of here we are never getting out of here we aee never getting out of hwee we are nevern i havte you all i fuckng hate you all i fucking hate you all why are you all fucking KEEPING ME~~  HER~~E~~
