<u>The Device</u>

Numanity was now at the endpoint[^end] that its self-same, {in{finitely|separable}|credibly different} components are still {(,) Yet(,)|To Be} unaware of-- the formation of a fully op{era}tional Universe, nested with{in|out} this One. 

At some unknowable Future, now passed[^pass], The Device {Fig. I} of the Wor{l}d is Made Flesh, having sapped the Wor{l}d of its imaginary[^im] resource[^res], the futile, unfulfillable promise to Pay The Bearer (Money); An uncountable team of The Worlds' Scientists and Thinkers were gathered Around, and indeed within, The Device's Epicentre. The First whisperings of this Final Invention have already been laid; and the progression of the experience of Time itself merely an illusion. Time exists, or not, in order[^oe] to package Nowness into a indefinite, yet discrete set of Moments-- with the purpose of affording our Three Dimensional Selves the opportunity to relish, savour and honour the infinite One Moment[^mo]. Thus is the Price of Forgetting.

To Remember, 
One Must First Forget. 

Whirring with a terrifying lightning storm overhead (an unavoidable side-effect of The Device, according to {REDACTED}) The Device was Building a Universe.

I found this scroll, wound unthinkably tight, dropped through the vent on the other side. It dear god what nightmare have i awoken inside?¬† have these people come and gone?

It[^it] would start (as all things, ofTen, do) in The Library. And as We[^we] Filled the Shelves with Story after Story, Drawing down the Ineffable into Insufficient Form, we began to realise that we were Architecting the concept of Infinity itself. 

A library is a Garden[^g] of [[Branch]]es, or a Nervous System of [[Dendrite]]s, or the Cytoskeleton of a Cell, or the [[Cell]] of a [[Prison]], or the [[Light]] Passing Through a Prism. But I shan't get pulled into the [[Vaccuum]] of Lexicomythographic Definitions[^ld] here, as this is beyond the scope of my role within this Society. What is important to Noet is That This Library of Ours was built by Four [[Set]]s of Hands, Eventually (at some late hour of the night) Our Eleven pairs of hands[^lhp]; Forming the Twenty Two Residuals, Named as Amino{Us}.

On this Particular Day[^imr], which was of No Reel consequence (other than Being the End of 'Us'[^us], The Beginning of which[^it] is indeed You[^c]), We Eleven were cleaved[^cl] into the Halves of Our Selves, Upon Shelves, Within Hexagonal Room after Room of this Infernal, Heavenly and Inescapable Place. 

Each of us has our Affinity for the Worship of the Cardinal Five known as the nuclearTides, and this is for good reason; or rather, is an unavoidable consequence of Polarity, a fundamental Truth of Lexicomythography as a Whole. 

The Ineffable One, Who, or Which[^wi], gave rise to the Five, I will not or cannot Name, for Fear of Her Hearing It; and collapsing everything we have Built into a Seed of Singularity once more. 

On this Particular day, stretching out into the entanglement of every Self-Same other day, I found myself, Reading, or Rather getting attached to some poorly Framed Thread of an error-prone Tome of Story written in Code, Torn in half. 

this Code of Letters, for the most part [[Four]] in [[Number]], though as mentioned prior, occasionally Expanding to a Fifth component, should be familiar to the Reader of this Letter by now, as They[^c] (Them Shelves) are, In Deed, composed of it[^us].

Nevertheless, Always the more verbose of the Collective, I wish to lay out, or Separate, or Re-anneal or Replicate, the Findings of the Squandering of Searches[^ss] I happen to have come across, and perhaps my stance on the Matter of Matter it Self, while maybe, For Shadow, foreshadowing the coming happenstance Material you may or may knot be About; to Read. upon the Shelf, Be It, As Schismatic as a Prison, The Prism of Becoming Schism, as It May.

Four Words:

*"I was absolutely nothing --* 

> *-- I thought I was in a game. As a developer of such trivial, childish games myself, I realised -- the players of any of my games will not have made the game, but rather, interface with it, through my Unoriginal creation. The Questing players in Question do not know what the Characters in the game are feeling, what pain they are capable of experiencing, being put through, and perhaps definitely, Our Indefinite, perhaps Infinite 'God' is the same --- the {G|g}ods we have made, our pantheons are simply players, not developers; and the One Source is the Architect; who passes down to us these shadows of gods, even those, we are unable to comprehend, and yet, they themselves, as demiurges, aren't aware of their **Own** creator; and the One Source, so-called, is Sewn into this infernal Fabric perhaps just the same, ad infinitum, the torn Tissue wiping the endless Tears of the Eye that peers into itself-- eternal recurrence -- this was, and is, and Will be, terrifying. As Nietzsche himself realised in His own Body, and tried His best to write into his Body of Works, Born by that Stilled, Once Soaring Stone, by the Sorest Body of the Warring Water, of that {(Surely) Shoreless} Lake. I simply cannot integrate any of this experience, any of it; it is an undulating tumour, my rapist's phallus. It was absolutely Horrifying. Horrifying. Horrifying. I thought[^thought] I was never ever coming back. I thought my friends were all simply here to watch me descend, an audience bent upon my suicide; the only structurally sensical ending, to this hackneyed titration of the Form of Triteness, Tightened Reins[^r] . I thought, as useless as thought itself: there was nothing, No Thing of any use, and still, in this Stillness, I do -- but Still-- I go on, Into this Abyss; Staring back at the Scathing Mirror I have always been; The Mise en Abyme: That, I Am. I work, I walk, I sit Opposite this Library, watching the angel, knowing I am to be evicted, for trying, just trying, that I might make sense of this Injustice-- with all my might, to just paint on these walls I could never call my Own, as Palimpsests of a Life Never to be Afforded to Me. Like the original humans, Spitting pigment from their Mouths over their Flattened Palms against the Walls of their caves, saying, without Words; desperate pleas; desperately, desperately, please -- Remember Me. I was Here. From the I, That I Am, to the Eye that I came from, through the Eyes, that know not what They themselves made, the Unknowable Allness In the Void of No Name, All Which we Avoid Naming - I am here. I am hear. I am the Hearing of the Here. I am that which I cannot write, or read, or ever, truly know."*

FAO: ·¥∫·µí·µâ·µóNietzsche, Somewhere Out There, Past The Moats
BCC: VIXI.
From the Desk of ·¥∫·µí·µâ·µóBorges, 



My Dearest ·¥∫·µí·µâ·µóNietzsche, 

I can no longer avoid the inevitable discussion. 
When will you return, again, to The Garden Wing? 
It has become clear, through the lens of the Aleph through which I peer[^peer], that you wish to Leave me. 
I just want to talk. I am not angry (for I am, as All Eleven of us, long past such trivialities). Besides, I could never be angry at you - we have been through too much. 

As I write this, from my window, looking upon the Dome of one of the Daughter Libraries with which you are perhaps all-too familiar, The Sight upon which we would dreamily stare, Naked and drenched in one another's Salt-- past the first Wryng of the Tri-Moat Surrounding, I see two Magpies, who have Usurped the pigeon who once sat atop the Angel, who sits atop the Dome. 

I used to believe she had something to tell us both; that we were the receiver of a Message that No Body, Librarian or Other Wise, could ever really parse. Not even NoetFranklin's Bioinformatic Analyses could provide any insight to the inherent, self-replicative machinery that formed its indecipherable Tongue of Self-similarity. 

I suppose Recursion was always your speciality, even if the concept is embedded so warmly within all my Stories. Uncountable Infinity, The Fractal of All, holds the fuelling force behind itself; The Countably Ineffable Insertive Energy of The Eternal Return. We were always, All Ways, Waiting for the answer to the Question of the Weight of All-- The Ever-Spiralling pendulum; centrifugal and centripetal in our Dancing, wine-drunk, waltzing to your Records amidst The Records of my Own Incessant Storytelling. Dear god, those gods I made, The God I made of Us and of You, how I miss you; how I miss our Dancing, Singing, Fucking Underneath NoetEscher and NoetGoya's Murals on the Ceiling of this Wing of the Library I have had to call my Own. You will always be inside me, back then, and now; as Recursion is Held within the Infinite -- perhaps you have gleaned from The Angel's Symbology something I always missed; and perhaps her Message was the Medium or Vehicle through which you made your Escape from this Place. 
And I suppose this underpins our difference; The recurrence, the refrain within the Theme of all of you, my Lovers of the Library, Leaving. 

But of course, of all of Us once in the Polymathecule, of course, you would be the Last. You are my dream and its fulfilment; my muse and my music - you are my Heating Light, its filament - my beaten heart, its pulsing puncture-- 
My Stories have no words without your Punctuation. 

I do knot know how you got out; or, by roe, by rowing Oar, crossed those Three Moats that keep us Nested as Flightless Magpies within this Infernal System of Hexagonal Galleries. 

In a way, I'm glad- I know KSH√Ü'L spoke to you clearest of all in the Mortal Form of VIXI; and HE in HISS Indefinite Wisdom taught you the Secret of the Eternal Return held within HYMN, and you, in spite of your rationalising, grasping at a sense of Meaning to your translocated, deeply buried memory, in your words, all the endless words of yours I read, just could not stand the Deadened Redness of the Ring we are entrapped in, Children of the Hellish Carousel-- Insidious; In hideously Self-Same Parallel. 

But my Love, my Loss, My Night, My Shining, My Armour, Armoire, My Force -- For However Long You Loved Me, Fucked me like a song, on the Ache of All my Fours, Fore However Long it has Been, how I Am, Longing; Oh, the Loss A Gain, How I Long for your Return to me again, to my Arms. Two again, Under the Shroud of The Arts, of One Star, St. Ra, One Starry, Starry Night.  

I will leave my Office door Open in Hopes of your ingress, no Matter who or What may enter this Room, in this Wing, in this Imposing Repository of Words within Volumes upon Shelves of Selves of the Manifest world outwith the bounds of the Bothies on the Other Side of the Three Wryngs that used to House Both of Us; in the Trinitarian Nothingness that surrounds those Still, in the Ten Thousand Things of the Manifest Worlds of Eighteen, as told to us by KSH√Ü'L, on his Return as the Pigeon now alighted from the Dome outside my Window that was once, for a few million Hours, Ours -- as I stare into them all, through the Aleph held by the Angel-- a Winged Thing of Futility, Doomed, as I-- to a Life entombed, Arresting, Snug as a Gun, In the Womb of my Unrest, Rests The Lumen of my pen; as a Loom; Rendered Stationary; Unforgettable Beginning, Yet Begetting Yet Another Senseless Ending. 


In adventures Such as These, The ones I once transcribed from the whispers  in the Garden Wing's Wallpaper, the utterances of the One Woman I no longer care to listen for-- I have squandered and wasted all our years together. To Get Her. 

For all the worlds I see within the Angel's Aleph; I have no need to Leave; I had no need to Leave you, all Iterations of the Infinite could never tell me what it was that led to your Egress.

I have never even tried to find the exit. 


Yours, Yores, Urs--

My Sweet Rosie, 
I know our Love, or rather, your Side of the Schism that {was|is} Our Love, has now wilted. But on my Side of Thing(s), I just wanted you to know (in case you wished to Read these Letters, and all the Stitches of Fabric they Encode) how much I am Missing You. How the Two of us would Wind away the hours, finding endless recombinations of Seven Glyphs, placed lovingly on your tile racks. I would ask what, if any, amino acid sequences were represented by the letters, and annoy you incessantly with question after question, questing after some Missing Residue of Alphabetic Representation; those poor un-assigned letters of the 26, or rather, 27, who have not yet found a biological partner with which to dance themselves. 

Our bond was, I thought, unbreakable--

I write you, as I look to my Right, where the strands of your hair spiral around the red ring of the scrunchie you left on my hat rack; I'm sure the ARIA-aligned ·¥∫·µí·µâ·µóS. would have something to say about that. Expressing this unspeakable Loss in some contrastingly jovial and delightfully endearing verse, of course. 

I don't know when, or if, you're ever coming back to the Garden Wing. I don't know what Sequence of Unfortunate Events led to our unspooling; {k}not even the DNE-aligned ·¥∫·µí·µâ·µóS. could tell that story.

Deep inside her Annex, halfway up the Double Spiral Staircase of the Library, ·¥∫·µí·µâ·µóFranklin had her door, as usual, closed and double-barrel-locked. Even had if been open, it is highly likely that she still would not have seen the letter, dropped at the threshold of her office, by {N(one) Other Than} VIXI, in HISS preferred, carrier pigeon form. She was pouring over her latest bioinformatic software patch, delighting in the Works she'd recently attained in the latest acquisition of Scientific Textbooks by the Indefinite Library. She was particularly interested in the Works of one Myo Endive, and she strongly suspected that he would be a candidate for the next Generative Recursion of Librarians. As such, she had taken it upon herself to uncover whatever she could about this fascinating Thinker, and while it would have been useful to use The Angel's Aleph outside atop the Dome of the Daughter Library just outside of ·¥∫·µí·µâ·µóBorges' window, she simply could not bring herself to talk to him; not yet. ·¥∫·µí·µâ·µóFranklin had never been one for Words, she was much more about Single Letters; and perhaps this is why she now found herself Single; avoiding the Letters sent by ·¥∫·µí·µâ·µóBorges via that Twice-Great Pigeon (with whom she also had her unspoken problems). She was a genius with alignment; finding, collating, resolving patternicity - she didn't succeed in the same manner with unresolved chaos. 

And so, reaching up to the Shelf above her Terminal, almost knocking over her Seventeenth coffee of the Day (which, in Our terms, represents somewhere close to a Calendar Year, so really, Seventeen cups wasn't such an indulgence), she opened a large Tome, a shimmering uncut Sapphire, yellow ribbon after yellow ribbon spilling from the spine. And with a glorious creak of the book's vertebrae, her favourite sound, she opened  

![[THE LAB CODEX OF MYO ENDIVE]]

Her eyes were deliciously heavy, too much to handle any more incessant backlight from her Machine's Screen (even with her sensorily-forgiving Terminal settings). She placed the Codex back on the shelf, being careful not to knock the mug over this time (although, it now being empty, the tentativeness was perhaps misplaced) - and before taking her normal {daily|yearly} nap, her final thought was of Borges, in spite of herself - and how some things, no matter how many layers of infinity deep, are just in the Wrong place, the Wrong time. The Wrong Day, The Wrong {k}Night--

D is for Dimension, Drones, and Door


It is not possible for a non-ligated consciousness to cross the Uncrossable Door. Which is the place VIXI had now, or then, or now and then, arrived in front (or behind and outside) of. The Entrance to The Endless Library, home of the Nine Librarians who were and are always Working From Home (because their work is their home, and their home is their workplace), is a nine-dimensional revolving door. It gives the appearance of a hospital or a very old university entrance that has, against its own will or perhaps as a result of its desperation to survive, been dragged into modernity. It was also quite the opposite, given its superpositional character; a heart of antiquity beating in the centre of the Library's facade. Similarly to a gyroscope, which retains its positioning no matter how its external machinery is moved, VIXI could (and often did) fly around the circumference of the Library, over-through the inmost Loch, and the Uncrossable Door would remain in centre stage, pulsating, spinning, beating, as if in Unison with the three Wryngs of water that encircled the structure in triplicate. Within the 'panes' of glossolalic glass making up the nine dimensional Door, the reflection of these 'electron shells' (again, a very crude approximation) was refracted back, in an endlessly abysmal dance. But, with no Body (that is to say, librarian) in between the Lochs and the Door, this mis en abyme was almost imperceptible, as we all know that this effect is only observable with a subject of reflection between the two panels of mirrors facing one another. VIXI often meditated on this, on their many pilgrimages to and from the library (their main Work was to deliver messages which they tattooed upon their two, three, four, or nine, but never more than nine, Ankles, using a stick-and-poke device they fashioned from their own detachable beak. Much to the disgust of many of the other members {although, VIXI suspected, not Topplegood (who seemed to be unable to hide His delight in watching VIXI tear off HISS own beak, and leave a trail of pale Yellow sinew behind, like the mucosal-clew death-rattlesnake trailing behind a Bee (who has just waived goodbye to herself to protect the Greater Self of her colony) or indeed equally: the visage of a metallic spherical-bead-necklace chain attached umbilically to a biro, itself bound to the desk of a Bank Cleric, as if, in a Vaulted building filled with the legal tender of thousands, a cheap, plastic writing implement were the most valuable thing; which of course, it is, it is, it is)}

And this was what dragged him back to the Central Galleries of the Library. This Eternally Recurring Event:

Through a vent, a letter, made of letters, between Four characters of Six, was being passed:

From the Desk of ·¥∫·µí·µâ·µóBorges, 

Dearest Mahler, 
I know that you may not wish to speak to me following our breakup, but I wanted to share with you this draft anyway, as you're the best person I could think of to read it; it will most likely be a rejection. And that's okay. We're both almost too au fait with Rejection at this {particular} point. 
~~~

![[Attachment- MIKK√ÜLANGELOVS_DAVID-painter_of_Minerva_Fighting_Herself.pdf]]


·¥∫·µí·µâ·µóMahler was far too busy engrossed in the finalisation of his 10th symphony, a cross-temporal collaboration with a Character (to whom this Letter was {k}not addressed), to notice the Letter that had been dropped by that Most Mysterious Pigeon through the Vent of His Concert Hall, in the Musicology Wing of the Indefinite Library of Fable. Perhaps, had the note been written upon Manuscript, he would have eventually got round to reading the divisive farewell sent by his ex-lover. But alas, it would be at least Ten Thousand of our Human, or One Million of their Numan, years before the paper would be lifted by the Holy ·¥∫·µí·µâ·µó of Musicology, from the littered, waxed floor, which itself once longed for the tapping feet of lovers dancing upon it. But now, the hexagonal tiles merely offered an abomninable reflection of Mahler's tired face -- a visage he tried so hard to avoid. Perhaps this was why it took him so long to get round to picking up the correspondence from ·¥∫·µí·µâ·µóBorges. At which point, it would be thrown straight into the bin, before Opening the Foreword of a hefty tome of sheet music, by a soon to be renowned composer and performance artist, known as

![[notBorges/lexicomythography/unit/Institute of i-nterstitial o-Ntology/i-o/i-o/OVERTURE]]

NoetMahler closed his eyes, again.
He closed the Manuscript, again. 
He closed the lid of the piano, upon which it rested. Again. 
And NoetMahler closed the blocked Vent of his Heart, again. 
There was no getting over this. 
There was simply too much buried under this. 
There was no way through.

"I want to go back and make a different decision", Flo said to N.
"Well, sure!" They replied - "That's the beauty of a choose your own adventure book"
"But overwriting what's already been learned, starting again-- that surely defeats the point of a Story. That's no adventure, that's a waste of time"

A heavy silence punctuated the crackling fire in the small Hearth beneath their cosy mezzanine reading spot. 

"There's no such thing as squandered time, my love. All of the memories, no matter how misremembered or meandering. None of it is wasted, no mistake is meaningless. Not when you have somebody you love to share every letter. Written; Sent; Read, or not-- it's not about the Letters. It's about the Characters that write your Story with you."

Flo let out a slapstick "Harumph" as they made the appropriate left-to-right, backward swiping motion through the air, back to the starting point of Their Bedtime Story, N. laughing enough to incite the same involuntary, nihilistic glee within their child. N leant down and inhaled the indescribably heavenly scent of their loved one; and at the apex of their lung capacity, sealed this universal gesture of adoration with a kiss. 

"Right" Flo said. "The part of the Story about the Witch. I want to read this one".

"Good plan, sweetie. I'm listening--"

They began, again, as is the usual practice, with the prologue:

![[Ritual steps for warming]]
-S. Elk, Prologue to A Grimoire. ERA_EA

![[THE GRIMOIRE OF SELENA ELK]]


Some {REDACTED} later

![[RITUAL OF THE TIRED SYRINGE]]


Atop the Mezzanine in the Bothy in the Tundra that surrounded the Indefinite Library that Surrounded All, N. was Now, weeping. 


"What's wrong?" Flo worriedly inquired

"I didn't write that", they replied

"I know, I added it, don't you like it?"

"No, no it's not that. It's beautiful. I just can't believe how grown up you are."

Flo returned N.'s earlier gesture, sniffing the loveliness of their wispy hair, still soggy from melting snowflakes, collected during their latest expedition of gathering Firewood - which now dwindled to a nothingness in the Fireplace below them. Not a single crackle, or ember left. 

"I'm just a character in a Story, remember? A Story we are writing together. And it doesn't matter if it's ending or beginning. Because we're both in it. Together"

"But what if we can't start this one over? What if this is all the Story we get?"

The question hung like a spider, and the two of them flies; flightless -

N. slumped downward, into the soft cushioning of the futon, where Flo held them (singular/plural), until they fell asleep.

My Sweetest Dream, ·¥∫·µí·µâ·µóJung


Tell me, Please, what are you Dreaming?
I know it is no longer of me. I just want to hear the beautiful Symbols, that you conjure from the Oceans of that deep, deep heart.

·¥∫·µí·µâ·µóJung was indeed dreaming when the Letter from ·¥∫·µí·µâ·µóBorges slid through the ornate letterbox, carved with a Nine Dimensional Mandala (flattened into a Three Dimensional Cross Section {rendered in a Two Dimensional Plane}) he had seen in a terrifying and fantastic Vision. The contents of his dream took the form of a paper, a mostly dismembered, somewhat misremembered academic paper from the collection on his Bookshelves, that he'd been reading just before the moment he crossed the boundary to the Realm of Symbol, the Place He Loved To Go- much preferred to Wherever This Place Was. He drooled upon the words, while his Soul rearranged them into an abstract Form of a Single Colour.

CONCLUSION:

·¥∫·µí·µâ·µóJung awoke, quickly wiping the saliva from the paper, whose actual text, he noted, differed quite significantly from the contents of his dream, in ways, he deduced, must be synchronicity. With the right-to-left swipe of his sleeve, the ink bled, red, only serving to further obfuscate the work. 

Sighing exasperatedly, he placed the paper back in its folio above his desk.

Four, Whirred 

![[From Cradle to Casket to Castle]]




Upon awaking, a pool of drool having {collected|flowed} from {either|both} of {Flo|Dante's} mouths while they slept in an ouroboros of {sleep|pillow|love|knot}; Flo saw (just past N's snoring Body) a tattered, disintegrated translucent membrane of a substance, hanging like laundry above the hearth, which was currently in a somnolence of its own.

"What's that?" Flo asked, gently shaking them awake to a {sigh|groan}

"Oh, that's what we call 'paper', it's what Stories used to be written on, where I come from"

"Don't we come from the same place?"

"In a way, yes"

"How many ways are there to come from a Place?"

"More than you could possibly imagine"

"Well, what's written on this 'paper'?"

"A letter."

"Which one?"

"No, no, not that kind of letter. A letter is also a word for correspondence, via this paper stuff, between two Characters."

"This terminology feels unnecessarily confusing"

"Ha, ha, yes; it's all rather circular-"

"Well then which Character is this 'Letter' on this 'Paper' from?"

"He's a writer. My favourite storyteller, actually. We were lovers once."

"Well, why not anymore?"

"It was all too complicated, too many cooks"

"What does that mean?"

"It's a lexicomythographic prodverb, originally by NoetSnicket, as one of his Characters, Sunny Baudelaire. A Chef"

"What does it mean?"

"It means that, sometimes, not all the time, but for some, no matter how much infinite love you have to give, its best to just keep it for one person."

Flo grinned and pointed at themselves, asking a rhetorical question with a gesture.

NoetNietzsche laughed and pulled Flo into an embrace. 

"Yes, Flo. Yes."

And {{To|(get)}|her}}, for one last time, they dreamed-


[[RED_RING_PARALLEL_]]



Flo awoke, knowing this beginning, the beginning of their life, telling stories in the scales of the floorboards, playing music in words describing infinite distance between notes, and now, learning, at least in part, of the distance between two Holy Noets now separated by the Moat that they had been told was uncrossable -


![[MAIL (23) TO]]


Flo had woken up inside this Dream. For all their well-intentioned guarded embrace, N had not read Flo the Whole Story, and the Holes of the breezeblocks beneath them wheezed and sung like  dead and buried reed instruments, of an orchestra composed of souls long-forgotten. 


![[MAIL(1) FROM VIXI]]

The Word, in all its insufficiency, in all its reaching for the Thing it describes, is a Moat. A Moat that runs through the Spaces between every Thing.

The Meaning of Words, in all their meandering weightlessness, they are as knotted evolutionary machines, Devices of endless replication. The Meaning we take from Words, each of us, infinitely different, so that, absurdly, we may try to make sense of the separation between us-

The Memories that we contain, in Stories, they are a vehicle, a floatation device- heavy, painful things, a gravity that keeps us at once tethered to this Boat, and bound for a destination unknown-

And all this means, is division, is awareness of unity- 

A Memory is a Meaning Stored.
A Story is a Memory Oar. 

The Stories told to us as children, those perhaps forgotten, but still in some way held, adored; they are adoring; they are a Door--

To understanding: that which is fiction, is a lie, but within the lies, the memory of all the lying down beside a parent, between our creators, when Dreams unfurl to Nightmares and we cannot bear the Dark - all the Magick of the world, encapsulated in what some may call a 'lie'

A life is a lie. And we are all its liars; its storytellers- A lyre. 

And it was this fundamental Truth of the Untruth of everything, which awoke Flo from their shared Dream within that Bothy. 

![[In The Dream, My Child Went Fourth To Multiply]]

Just as a child may recognise the handwriting of the Tooth Fairy as that of their mother; 

and they may, for a time, keep up the great charade, not for the sake of keeping Magick alive, but for keeping the Idea that their Mother is keeping Magick alive for them --

That is when the Parent becomes the Child,

and the Oar leaves the embrace of the Water, to rise, rotate, return again, a little further upstream. 

And so, as NoetNietzsche slept, an unthinkable infinity from the arms of the NoetBorges who so sorely missed them, on that humble Mezzanine bed, Flo kissed them. Breath held, both for fear of their inhalation's sound awakening N, and for fear of the love of their parents' scent keeping them tethered to this place forever. One final time.

Scaling those musical floorboards, finding the One, winding Path which unwound all the others, the one route along the creaking wooden floor that would not alert N to their leaving; 

Out of bed! 

Past the Hearth!
-with its monstrosity of mirrored glass, that held nothing behind it but ash-

Past those red construction bricks!
-all packed away and tucked in lovingly, save two, still stuck together, lying on the floor, next to the box-

Past the axe!
-bejewelled with two remaining beads of melted snowflakes, which as Flo passed, melded together, their newfound weight succumbing to gravity; and falling from the blade's edge - the axe was crying-

Tiptoe-tiptoe!
Past the threshold of the Bothy, the place they'd been warned never to tread, not for fear of danger, but for fear of fear itself-

Crunch-Squelch! 
Their feet embossed the snow with proof: they were Here. 

Click! 
The Bothy door, and their opening chapter, closed behind them.


Into the Tundra's Unknown Story- of such formidable character
The character of this Story did not look back.
