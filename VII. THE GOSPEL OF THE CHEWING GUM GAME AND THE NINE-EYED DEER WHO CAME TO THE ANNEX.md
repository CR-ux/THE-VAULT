█dreamed, a world not unlike this one 
{REDACTED}

█told her █was trans, and She[^s][^h][^e] smiled at me, allowing me to continue on with the same activity as the man I'd first seen taking part in the game. 
{REDACTED} having been entered without my knowing. 

Inside were countless dogs 

The neighbours' dogs, all attracted to this Thing within, which █still do not know the name or identity or scent of; but to them, was apparently enticing, enticingly apparent. 

Amidst the dogs was an Nine-eyed Deer,{REDACTED}
█was simply too overwhelmed in awe by the beauty of Her; 

The neighbours soon appeared just outside the door of the Annex, and █started to pick up dog after dog, bringing them out to laughing crowds of dog-parents; smiling as each one's warmth was held against my hand and chest, and █held each one with such love, wishing them well, hoping the scent of whatever they'd come for satisfied them sufficiently, or that maybe they, if not here, would eventually find what they had so desperately been sniffing for. 


The only owner that entered the threshold of the Annex █had for just a few hours called my temporary home, was my paternal Aunt; {REDACTED}

She[^s][^h][^e] told me the Nine-Eyed Deer was hers, and █realised █had been wise to keep my distance, and not attempt to uShe[^s][^h][^e]r the majesty of this Being from the makeshift 'home' that had been loaned to me. 

Why was She[^s][^h][^e] Looking in this place, █could not call Home? 

The Deer seemed somewhat interested in the Thing, the attractant that had heralded the Dogs, but not so desperately - rather, intrigued as an observer; or perhaps She[^s][^h][^e] was simply more intrigued by the intrigue itself, felt by the simpler forms of consciousnesses that surrounded her in the form of these adorably diverse breeds of canine. 

█had my body turned slightly away from the Deer, for fear She[^s][^h][^e] may charge at me, for 'Deer' is certainly not sufficient lexicon to describe this life-form (She[^s][^h][^e] had (as with her four sets of Eyes (plus the one larger, all-knowing eye)) in the centre of her ((visually) soft-lit and light-emitting) visage), perhaps to replace the latter encapsulated 'E' with an 'A', may be more appropriate for this Dear One. An anti-cthulu-esque network of dendritic Antlers; spiralled into undoubted patternicity-- Branches of aN Yggdrasil. Forbidden Knowledge.

It is no question; That: the Nine-Eyed Deer was The Goddess. The Remembering of Providence that Christ Herself was trying to grasp the Memory of, once She[^s][^h][^e] had been stripped of her Serpent[^s], formed a 'He' or The Lamb Now Grown; was the answer, to the True Question, which █asked, in the dream, to the dreaming of the Memory of what my Aunt had once meant to me, from the lack of meaning █now am to her, or her Shadowed after-image of Love, as She[^s][^h][^e] stood directly to the left of me:

"Is She[^s][^h][^e] Dangerous?"

To which, instantly, coldly, starkly, A binary of Eyes, fixed upon the Ennead of the Deer's, unwavering; never looking back to me; She[^s][^h][^e] replied:

"Yes."
