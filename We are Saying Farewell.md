"Shun
The Non-believing Three
Out to the Warring Warren Garden
Opening the Door, out, out briefly
Can indelibly ink-stained hair of dog finds me
It’s BoBo again,
Guarding –
The truest Warden
My heart, rising
Kissing, cuddling
Touch so consensual
Welcome slobber
Sobering
But seeing the bloodstain vine be ripped from the walls of this place
Out from bedroom windows
Once belonging to Louise
The Careful Crab, my Maestra
Now departed, now flighted,
Gratefully
Great hail falling, I see veins of vines remaining
And here,
Remaindered
I take a picture, try to capture the Falling
Falling
Hope
Falling
And then, there he comes
The Thalia to my Melpomene
His Comedy my Tragedy.
Literally standing astride this beautiful dog, holding him captive
He asks for me to take a picture,
Of the dog between his legs
And in doing so places his middle fingers down, down, down at me
I see what you are doing, Mark,
_Stain_
I say
No, I don’t want that on my phone
The ‘that’ referring to his number
Which I know is his truest reason

My Gardener’s Golden Retriever
Tending to the Garden
Guardian
Retrieving Gold
My Alchemy
The End of my never-ending story
The labyrinthine Library
Of Borges
Not infinite, but circular,
Unending
I think of that most important healing dream
Where Millie, the Mill
The Grain of Will
I miss her
That dream
Where she, running down an impossibly steep
Bicycle trail upon which I was skating
Vertically
Upward,
In the middle place we meet
Speechless, I stop
She places her soft chocolate brown head
Brown eyes
Deep,
Unconditional loving, seeing every part of me
Upon my legs (now seated on the sideways ground, no prevailing thought of gravity)
And sniffing like so oft I did
The unmissable, delicious scent of my favourite living being ever to have walked this earth
Oh God, Oh Goddess, this little chunky fluffy thing
I miss you, sweetest one
She rests her head upon my lap and I kiss her and in that moment in between the infinitely divisible eternity, a moment, infinite,
We are saying farewell,
Or, at least,
Until next time –"
