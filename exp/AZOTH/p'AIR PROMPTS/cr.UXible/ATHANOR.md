Certain medieval theologians describe four methods of interpreting the scriptures: literal/historical, tropological/moral, allegorical/typological, and anagogical. Hugh of Saint Victor, in De scripturis et scriptoribus sacris, distinguished anagoge, as a kind of allegory, from simple allegory.\[2\] He differentiated in the following way: in a simple allegory, an invisible action is (simply) signified or represented by a visible action; Anagoge is that "reasoning upwards" (sursum ductio), when, from the visible, the invisible action is disclosed or revealed.\[3\]

The four methods of interpretation point in four different directions: The literal/historical backwards to the past, the allegoric forwards to the future, the tropological downwards to the moral/human, and the anagogic upwards to the spiritual/heavenly.\[4\]
The points of the cross. The Elements, the tetragrammaton, the four headed I AM

Each individual has a majority alignment towards one of these Cardinal chambers of the Gated Heart, at any given time, and these chambers will fill and empty in sporadic flux by unenlightened nature, affected entirely by external influence and identification with and clinging to fleeting states of Being.  But I, Callie Rose Petal, The Seeker, am predominantly a Fire Elemental Witch.
