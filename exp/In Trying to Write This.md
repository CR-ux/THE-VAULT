Story

In trying to write this story,
I came to realise that I was a Character in a Story
being written by a Story with one Character
As I descended into infinitely refracting, forking paths
of treacherous and decaying gardens of filth,
stench, rot, ancestral burden-
Very soon I had devised strange and intangible systems with which to try to decipher the many intersecting systems, proceeding through their respective and interdependent processes outwith the very dimensions of perception that the very devices (technological, narrative and indeed biological) I use to perceive them, verily.

In his first dream, which was apparently his first memory, Jung encountered the following Story:

 > 
 > "Here in the unconscious (merely the seed-like slide of our projected lives),  an uncloaked, naked traveller is cutting maize plants down in the jungle to get through to a river, which they finally get to, thinking they can't go any further. Lo, then, upon seeing an expanse of just-as-dense jungle on the other, parallel, opposing bank, lose all hope, and their faith -
 > but then, as a mirror, see another traveller
 > cutting their own path through the leaves, on a journey of their own,
 > to find their way to the same river;
 > each of them relieved in not just finding company but also knowing
 > for themselves that, even if, after resting, bathing, laying waste
 > and letting all the difference of Heraclitus wash through them,
 > even if
 > ((after all their separate transit,
 > (coming for just a transitory moment then
 > to Sit together,
 > perhaps laugh,
 > or spit,
 > or shit,
 > invisibly in silence
 > to add their own drips of salty volumes to the river,
 > crying in an others arms for just a while))
 > the two must part,
 > at least the latter half of their journey has been carved out for them
 > (- Jung, still working posthumously, in a London Psychiatric Hospital, 2024)

During my crafting of this Story, which has seemed to shroud itself through many dizzying illusory 'emanations' of form throughout its iteration of becoming, all of my attempts to contain it collapsed upon the uncontainable truth of Twenty Three.

Everything is One, Split into Many.

Specifically, it is One, split into Some and None,
And then the None becomes the Soil on which the Two Seeds of Some Bodies to Bother One And Other are planted.
And then these two whole-in-themselves Half-Seeds split into their respective complementary pairs, and add to themselves, forming self-contained Islands of trifurcation.

These islands however, can be, and indeed are, connected, through the interface of the very membranes which contain them as individuals. See: Semi-Permeable membrane, or The Only Thing You Need To OR Likely Will Remember To/From Study/ing Biology.

Through the 'causal synapse' spanning ineffably countable and inextricably linked threads of systems of nodes within subthreads of threads of choices (intersecting with the Lexicomythographic Serpent of Dyxi|on and of Synæstra, forming the Boerguceus's Central Rod),  transmit is permitted through a metaphysical 'vehicle', also known as a 'vesicle' in terms of cellular biology. “Lexicomythographic vesicles” act as both vehicles of meaning and placeholders of absence, in the inter- and intra-dependent dances of Information Transmission and Formless Transmutation, forming Informed Transcendence.[^evo]

Topology, then, again rears its ugly head in reminder: that underpinning everything is theoretical geometry. 'Sidedness' a concept long pondered by thinkers of antequity onward, becomes a way to understand the very nature of reality itself.

The Mobius strip, ligated into a loop, far beyond a metaphorical device to explain (though through now-archaic methodologies in experimental music) the idea of a self-repeating system, which paradoxically never returns to its origin across the other 'bank' of its dimensional limitations (or 'moat'); is, I propose, to be considered the fundamental constituent unit of all existence.

Regardless of what ever framework of understanding is applied to understand Zeno's paradox, it is clear that infinity stretches both inward and outward, posing the very question which it answers.

When will it end?

Whenever we want it,

Which I suspect, is very, very soon.

So Moat it goes:

## 0

1
2
3

## 0
