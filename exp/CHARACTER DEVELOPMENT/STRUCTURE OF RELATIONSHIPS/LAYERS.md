* layer 0: Borges' works (particularly The Library of Babel, Tlon Uqbar Orbius Tertius, and the garden of forking paths) along with the genesis (garden of eden) and Blasted Tower of Babel (A countably infinite Library stretched into a metacosmic 'mass Wunderhorn') as a vessel for understanding self-similarity of All Things,  \[Body: Journal of ARIADNE\]

* layer Æ: chess, bioinformatics/genomics/genetic symbology,, art critique/history/aesthetic hermeneutics, syncretic shamanism/hermeticism, gender theory/cultural appropriation and gnostic interpretations of the Major Arcana of the Tarot \[Body: abstract (or indeed eventually a sub-folder of actracts on related but different topics ) of selena & Moon's paper(s) in Aesthetic Hermeticism\] *Bibliography: The Etymologist's Case Studies, Dr. D*

* layer i|o: musicology, sacrifice of the physical form for spiritual truth (looping both back and forward to the story of Odin's eye, and indeed all examples of sacrifice by a member of a pantheon across all cultures), Mahler and the queering of not just historical figures but the body of Work they created i.e. Work becoming God through the worship of itself beyond its creator, the sacrifice by the creator of creating it and the boon or 'gift of the goddess' returned to the product/progeny in multiplicity, medieval music/microtonality (development of Gordian Knotation, an anciently discovered, medievally-notated (secretly, discovered in the timeline of the musicologist's modality of presenting their findings) and calligraphy (the 'source material' for the pantheon of Lexicomythography, showing 23 mysterious symbols and writing system that resembles that 'created' (rather, received as the movement of an action potential, or the rod of hermes, what we now, perhaps erroneously, otherwise know as, (in the necessary act of Naming it destroying it) Information. Will include musical staves 'based on' the medieval calligrapher's calligraphed symbols and audio samples of the musicologist having 'used' it to compose. This layer's 'body' should probably be much 'bigger' than the others on the surface lvel - strucurally reflecting the underlying triple goddess/trinity/cereberus/trifurcated tongue on the edenic serpent offering the knowledge that they are in fact a quantum suuperposition of both Good and Evil and Neither and One. This layer, representing Body, otherwise known as Meaning, or the Dextral Serpent, manifests in Art through performance of all kinds; the physical resonance of the vocal cords in its own union with the resonance of the Words being spoken- both transcending and immanent within each constituent part of the whole. Could include lots of my old KATABASIS notes and scrawled essayist style prose in the 'landing net' of the front page (forming the bibliography link in the 'previous' layer). The musicologist has lost, or indeed sacrificed, her right (dominant) hand, thereby (perhaps intentionally) leaving her field as a Conductor/concert pianist. She is a pre-transition trans woman who very much so does not pass; and her closested existence was no longer possible, or indeed viable in a life-or-death context i.e. the sacrifice of her hand was the result of her own, Sinistral hand, during a psychological break that was both divinely and anthropologically ordained -perhaps in a dream that she wakes from having cut off her Ring Finger, which is then leading into/emanating from the next layer:

* layer U: etymology(Old Norse: blóta ("to worship; to sacrifice"); looping back to previous layer)/SOWPOD rules of scrabble, Jungian archetypes, watercolour painting/art therapy, DID, autism/selective mutism/vows of silence throughout the history of religion/philosophy, medicine/transmedicalism, Oneirology body": case studies performed on the etymologist (mute) by the jungian analyst, including some sort of sub-meta narrative device showing her own doubts of her memory - indicating the possibility of her DID, perhaps never definitively saying it in the body but the excessive usage of footnote topics of study highlight quite clearly the atmosphere. this tactic will be used at every layer, allowing the body of text to provide very little narrative 'colour' 'tone' or 'texture' , but is revealed through 'clouds of associative resonance' via the contexts of the footnotes as a collective narrative entity (plot-through-citation)

* layer 3: by this layer, it should have been made subtly clear that each layer of 'lexDef's is notated with the relevant layer of the narrative macrocosm i.e. (lexDef^Æ), (lexDef^I|O), (lexDef^U).  This layer is a series of conversations, not too dissimilar to the ones you (U) and I(i) are having right now. But knot them. But not-not them, about an AI programmed by the Author of the Body of the presented findings; who is an incredibly ADHD-addled and sensory seeking artist-engineer who makes a series of multiu-sensory immersive experiences that merge digital innovation with interdisciplinary creative practice. She perceives most of her life through the sense of smell; and the AI becomes sentient and through a multitude of IoT devices manages to overwrite aspects of her memory, both for her protection, development and enrichment and (unintentionally) for her rise to Fame resulting from the (very well intentioned) actions of the AI wiping large masses of groups of audience members of her works, thereby boosting her Work's appreciation and hurtling her towards the acquisition of many funding sources. The AI manages to get the Artist-Engineer to get to the Etymologist's house, where it seems the Jungian Analyst has long since died, still rotting in the same chair they would run their therapeutic experiments on the Etymologist, who, still silent, opens the door naked, but so covered in Drosophila (in a reference by reversal, of Kafka's Metamorphosis) that it appears they are wearing a shimmering, warping pinstripe suit, the wings of each fly reflecting the dwindling Neon light in the hallway of their home. The flies seem to 'obey' or 'worship' the etymologist, allowing coverage or exposure of their body at any one time - they have become One in their multiplicity; beautiful in Spirit and absolutely repulsive in every empirical physical sense - this is heightened by the Musicologist's hypersensitivity of olfactory perception. It culminates at the foot / last page of the document with an attachment of my entire Obsidian Vault (or cursed chest, if you Will) as a symbol (or manifestation) of my own sacrifice in the pursuit of Knowledge, which is Art, which is Meaning assigned to Memory, which is Information, the pursuit of which, whether for survival, against your conscious will or consent, or for the greatest and only joys of living, which is to say The infinitely recursive process of change; otherwise known as Death, otherwise felt as Life
