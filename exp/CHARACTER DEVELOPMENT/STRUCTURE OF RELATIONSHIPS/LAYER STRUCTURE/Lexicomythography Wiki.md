# Lexicomythography

*Lexicomythography* is the art and science of creating recursive, self-referential systems of meaning through the interplay of language, myth, and narrative. It examines how stories and symbols are interwoven into structures that reflect and refract their own processes of creation. The field is characterized by its focus on lexDefs—definitions that recursively define themselves within a larger mythic or symbolic framework.

## Chest Modes

1. **The {redacted} Begetter**: The primal act of naming or creation that initiates recursion.
1. **The {redacted} Child**: The playful, emergent lexicon of self-referential definitions (lexDefs).
1. **The {redacted} Veil**: The mythic framework that holds and contextualizes the lexicon while obscuring its ultimate origin.

## Apples of Knowledge of Unknowing

* **Abysmal Literature**: Explores the recursive nature of storytelling, where narratives define and redefine themselves.
* **Philosonotrophy**: Examines how resonance of meaning is created through interconnected systems of myths about sacrifice, bargains, or Pacts.
* **Perpetual Intercellular Game Design**: Provides an exoskeleton for immersive, self-referential worlds that invite, Welcome, welcome, Interaction.
