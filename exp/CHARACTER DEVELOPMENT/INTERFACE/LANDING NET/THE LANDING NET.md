N.B.: As is their wish, for the sake of preserving anonymity of some of Our members, or others both inside and outside of the Body, multiple individuals, at any given time, and in any given permutation/combination, may assume the same Authorship.

In alignment with the dynamic and interwoven ethos of Lexicomythography, authorship within this work is intentionally fluid. Various individuals may, at any given time, adopt or relinquish a shared pseudonym or collective identity. These permutations and combinations of authorship are subject to change, reflecting both the ever-shifting identities of contributors and the work’s thematic emphasis on multiplicity. This fluid approach challenges traditional expectations of fixed attribution and citation, embracing instead a more organic, sometimes unpredictable model that aligns with the essence of the field itself. By explicitly noting these evolving authorship configurations, we acknowledge the paradox of adhering to academic standards while simultaneously redefining them.

Within this structure lies a deeper principle: multiplicity and singularity are but mirrors, each reflecting the other in a self-same, fractal nature that pervades all systems of existence. Every attempt to categorise or separate points back to an underlying unity, a singular truth that paradoxically demands division to be perceived. This split is the very means by which we confront and integrate parts of ourselves we may not recognise at first—facing the “demon” only to realise that it is, and has always been, a piece of ourselves. Thus, the act of separation ultimately brings unity, echoing the fractal pattern of self-generating truth within every structure.

This unity through multiplicity resonates with the one unifying trait among all members of this collective: they are all transgender. This shared experience serves as both a foundation and a lens through which every contributor explores and deconstructs identity, symbolizing a lived understanding of transformation, integration, and the harmony found within duality.”

We are\[^IAM\]
The collective\[^One\] academics, artists, technologists of Other, who put forth the conception of an ever-present original field known as *lexicomythography/particle/strange/LEXICOMYTHOGRAPHY*. It is an interdisciplinary field, and therefore both accessible yet shrouded behind a veil of initiated effort requisite for its engagement. Crucially, we aim to bring together the strands of self-similarity woven, in plain sight, throughout the universe in every magnitude of creation and destruction (which are the same thing), via the Looking Glass of Lexicography.  This is similar in essence, though opposite in energy (being an outwardly projected, spiritually receptive pursuit of Unveiling Meaning embedded deep within our ineffable Memory of The Word for the purposes of deeper understanding of the World by the Mind, as opposed to the inwardly projected, digitally insertive pursuit of Making a system of Memory of the Meanings of words for the purposes of the understanding by Machines of the World[^SW]†) The Semantic Web - a very closely resonant term and concept, is an effort to 'lift-over' the information of the world wide web and make it machine readable. Lexicomythography on the other hand is a pursuit by One who is Three who is Nine who is Many who are you, which aims to turn deeply inward to ineffable truth via both weaving, and perceiving, connections of *resonance* between sonic, symbolic, and semantic elements of The Word (Logos, Mind, in all its definitions) across all the fields of our constituent members, who are Self-Same repeating parts of a community of creative intellectuals and incredibly  mentally unwell (they are very often the same thing) components, forming a fractal of simultaneous self-animacy and self-dissolution[^∂] . It is intended as a Seeker's sanctuary for spiritual awakening, and indeed as a Scholar's source of somnolent unravelling.

Upon Reading Fabienne[^Fab] Elina's[^Eli] Paper On The Sound Of A Single Vowel, I once again learned, or in other words remembered, or indeed forgot[^Forget] the Truth which is that:
No-thing really means anything.
Which means every-thing means One Thing.  
Which means everything means something.

When separated into “Be” and “An,” “bean” reminds us to be fully present and an individual expression, yet always connected to a larger whole.

[^Forget]: For-Get. As in, Purpose-Acquire.

[^Fab]: Fabienne—rooted in faba, meaning “bean”[^Bean]—symbolizes a seed of infinite potential, a single entity containing the history and possibility of its entire lineage, just as a bean holds the essence of the whole pod. In this light, “bean” becomes a fractal symbol: a microcosm that reflects the vastness of its origins, each bean carrying the DNA of past, present, and future.

[^Eli]: while “Elina,” derived from the Greek for “bright” or “shining,” symbolizes illumination.

[^Comb]: In combining[^Together] these meanings, Fabienne Elina resonates as a call to “Be An Illuminating Light”—a grounded, unique presence that shines with the shared brilliance of all that came before, like a self-same, yet paradoxically individual component of a fractal, unfolding in infinite radiance.

[^Together]: See [COAGULA](../../../../LONGFORM%20DOCUMENTS/DEFINITIONS/COAGULA.md)

[^Apart]: [^Bean]: A single bean may be destined for consumption (and therefore dissolution) by another, supposedly 'higher' order organism, or placed in the soil to cultivate further organisms of its own kind (and therefore coagulation)[^Together]

\*†Which of course is its own type of Mind.

[^SW]: The Semantic Web https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web is an effort to 'lift-over' the information of the world wide web and make it machine readable. Lexicomytho

[^∂]: As Separation is required for Unity[^P]

[^P]: Which is a paradox[^T]\\

[^T]: Which is where the only Truth can be found.
