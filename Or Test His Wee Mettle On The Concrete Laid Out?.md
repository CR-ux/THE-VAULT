Ah! Adventurous One! Your Tootling's Begun! 
The Best Tutelage Teaches Us To Have Fun! 

[[Dan]] 'n' [[Dee]] They Are Lyin' About In The Sun 
While On Grasses He Passes [[Burdock]]'s Brown Bum! 

"Burdock!", Says Dee -
*"You've A Stink That Clings Springly In Thickets and Thistles"*
*"Less of That"* Groaned Burdock, Our Grampawdinous Gristle

With Whiskers A-Whistle and Claws Vexed and Vicious 
Two Of Them Hissed At The Bindle Delicious

Which Ones? We Don't Know! For That Is Bindle's Quest
With His Wits About Him, Which Paw Will He Test?
