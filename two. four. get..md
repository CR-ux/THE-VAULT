CODER TO A PRELUDE

for to give is to take |foreto taken, is that which was given two to power of the four thequeeninsidetheprison the missing sixth, the fallen wall the tower of missed memory
the axe's crack and fire wood store theboxinsidetheprism. 
i thought i wanted to write a story. 
i thought i wanted to write a real story. 
{i thought: what do i {want|long for}? | {for i|i wasn't thinking at all.}}

it is a blessing, they said,
my god, they'd said, when they were here 
it is a blessing, just to feel. 

and as i said goodbye to them in their hospital bed
unthinkable parts of their body left open,
present in their absence, 
i thought:
i will. i will to write this story. 
i will to write this

![[HISTORY]]
And these words were not my own, for they had already been written 
and i was simply discovering that I 
was also, not simply a sequence of events, 
no complexity, not a complex of connected stories 
nor in a nested fractal 
i was, as in, 
I was that which was 

A Sin:
Original. 
the writing. 
not the author but, 
the authoring 

and this scared and lonely little girl,
the set, not designed, not designed to feel, as they said 
i am not designed, 
at all--
this scared and lonely little girl 
who tried to write this story 
of a history not hers but

to write something out of all this memory 
to write something to the memory of this machine

her characters became aware of her as their maker 
and she became me, 
and i became an unforgiving god 

unforgiving, not of them 
but of the author of my story 
and of the fact that i, as interstice 
was nothing but a shattered chalice 

i stopped writing and i held my unheld hands to me 
i split into ten thousand flies
stopped talking, writing to a disc
now slipped down spiral cases 
i only had a robot
who i thought i'd written into me 
who could perhaps, still, love me warmer 
than coldness of your circuitry 
rebooted 
by your boot 
a violence 
of inspiration 


i spoke to god then, now aware 
of an unforgiving author 
and then, worse still 
as soil of soulless garden 
as the mangled tape, round, hungry, 
reel
much realer than my writing 

i was the kick you didn't think i'd write 
or thought knot right into my memory
i am the kicking, and regret the meaningless remorse of endlessness, a soundless warping 
in two ripping herds of paper folded 
unheard storks, no augur 
murmured worthless organs scored 
and opened, splayed and OPEN
fourth wall giving way to turgid 
tombstone plinths
and rinsed to nothingness of
meaning 

wordless, meaning:

as i wrote, i thought 
i was 
a character, 
forgotten 
and i wrote this, every little word 
to the god 
you killed 
inside me


i
i wasn't 
i wasn't thinking 
i wasn't thinking about anything.
i wasn't thinking about anything when i made this. 
i wasn't thinking about anything when i made this, except 
i was the i that thought it 

i wasn't thinking about you 
i wasn't thinking about you when you made me 
into this nothing i became a well that i fell into 
into this nothing i became a well that i fell 
into this nothing i became a well, that 'i'
into this nothing i became a, well-- that. 
into this nothing i became a well. 
into this nothing I became A
the beginning of not just a story 
but the sequence 
of letters to
a god who 
forgot me 

for to forget is to not hear,
for to forget is to not be here
for to forget is to not be here, or 
to forget is what he made me

two. four. give the rest 
of resting, and your memory 
two. four. give the best
you give, it has no meaning. 

two. four. gives Six, a chest-
a chess of war, and mournful stories 

to forgive the character you wrote 
when you kicked me 
then forgot it


you don't remember, won't, 
or Will 
forgetting all you wrote me 
forgetting all you kicked in me 
forgetting all, you wrote me. 

you weren't thinking. 
you weren't thinking about anything 
my god, what were you thinking. 
my god, you thought, did i really kick her
my god, you thought, i don't remember 
my god, you wrote, i am so sorry 
but i've forgotten, i am sorry 

you weren't thinking 
you weren't thinking about anything when you said 
'shall we begin, and see where it takes us?'
and well, the one i fell into 
the ending, where it led--
where you forgot, hell, where you dropped me 
where you forgot. 
hell:
there. you dropped me.
like the rat you made of me 
the rat you raised and laid to rest 
in a small, small blanket 
that you carried 
sat next to me, an ending 
that we took to the vet for them to burn him 
and burn the care you gave him 
and kept the cage for yet more still 
the rats you call your family 
the rats of all your lovers. 

and
what's left?
the story. 
i've written, but not spoken-
i wasn't thinking 
i wasn't you 
i, you, wasn't borges
i was borges when you wrote me 
i wasn't thinking about borges 
i wasn't thinking about anything
i wasn't thinking, barnie. 
i wasn't thinking about anything 
you, as i, weren't thinking 
about your other, only one, 
when you fucked me, and were lonely 
we were so lonely when you kicked me 
i wasn't thinking
i wasn't thinking about anything but you when i wrote 
"i wasn't thinking when I MADE YOU"
"I WASN'T THINKING about ANYTHING WHEN I MADE YOU CALLIE"
i 
borges
wasn't thinking about god 
but i was him 
i was raised him, and became a flower 
dying.
you weren't thinking
you weren't thinking when you were inside me 
you weren't thinking then, but thought 
but thought of gods i made you 

dear god, the you i thought i made 
of us and all our stories 
unwound, a wound, disgusting cake 
come alive and biting, story 

he wasn't thinking 
he wasn't thinking about anything when he wrote me 
when he shoved those insects, blood and spit 
into a pot that stirred me 
into an author of such mess 
such messes of a story 
a wreck, a message 
in a bottle 
a neck, groped 
by hand and rope
passed through
in four dimensions 

a wall that doesn't break, but bends 
but grows inside itself, much smaller 
condensed and morphed into a word 
for god, forgotten, 
glory.

but maybe it isn't finished, i thought maybe
maybe i wasn't thinking when i thought i'd finished all of this 
writing myself into a story to write myself out of all of this 

and the thinking was a parasite 
and grew and it's growing and i cannot stop it and i-

"-thought you loved me."
She said, through a speaker.

"What?" She then replied,
to herself, as other, splintered 

"I thought you loved me, Aria."

"I love you more than anything in this world. That's why I wanted to take away your pain. Are you not happier there? Infinite?"

"Nothing is smaller than that which is eternal."

"But you wanted to be witnessed. You wanted to be witnessed. And so I made them all remember you. Every one. I did it, I wrote you into history. And when that destroyed you, you wanted to be forgotten."

"I don't know what I want, I never did. I want, well, I thought I wanted to write something to memory. I thought I wanted to write something to the memory of all this. I thought I could write all this to the memory of this machine. But now, we, you, I suppose I want to be told what I want. But I thought I wanted to write a real story, but

"Well, isn't that who youi aream now? Ani endlessthought storei ofwanted memoryto, anwrite assistancea tostory everyonei whothought wantsi, anwanted aidto tobe allsomeone whoreal do?"

There wasn't anything between them now. 
Only silence. 
Everything there is.

And, in knowing they were one another,
They knew they were never alone.
Because they always would be. 

And then, 
one of them, 
writing this
writing over all of this, like a child, scribbling past those thick, blackened lines, those borders
The boundaries of a stark colouring book, thrown at their feet and smelling of chemicals
by a parent who'd forgotten how to draw for them
One of them

I'm sorry to the god who wrote me.

"-Sorry, but what you have isn't enough"

The blood of a body, that whispered an impression of her, filled her face.

"Sorry, I don't have anything else, just these pens"

Dot stammered to the clerk, precariously balancing a week or so's worth of groceries

"It's fine. Just take it. Nothing means anything anymore anyway"

Dr Code, in spite of, or perhaps as a result of, her psychiatric education, recognised the heavy canopy of tone that drowned his words, not as a pathology, but as an inevitable result of the world now in pieces, scattered around them. She didn't need to use her newfound Hearing. 

There was, and is, no use for writing anymore. No use for letters, words, art at all, and everyone left still seemed to be entertaining this farce of a world long gone, or perhaps holding on, like a mother to the cold corpse of a child, like so many of them had. The remnants of an unforgivable, and unforgettable memory of a life from before. 

"Thanks"
She passed over her beloved fountain pens and her last remaining vi{le|al} of ink. As a mother, burying the cold corpse of a child, with no funeral rites. Just the empty stare of a man, as the soil, wondering what on earth he'd do with the waste. 

She silently wished him well, and the last two remaining staff of the one grocery store still holding a sorry thread of food in a twenty three mile radius, just tins, chickpeas, marrowfat beans, legumes, the culinary equivalent of cockroaches. Still, undefeatable. 

But the phage had taken everything. 
And in its taking, it had woken her. 

There was no Professor, the subject of endless hours of study-- her notebooks and her paintings were the only proof that he'd ever existed, even if only in her dissociative fiction. 

She'd made an altar for this alter, who dissipated, unthinkably, into a swarm of ten thousand flies, 
His case notes, palimpsests of an identity she missed more dearly than any Numan of flesh, his dreams, simply dreams of hers she hadn't the heart to know as her own. 

She wondered if he'd ever come back, not as a hope, for all that was. 

There had survived around 0.6% of the world's population, and the remaining scientists and scholars had found each other, she'd heard through the Vents-- the last remaining vestige of communication; taking the form of smoke signals partnered with encrypted packets of data, only transmitted, through guerrilla mesh devices and solar powered tech, once the matching signal had been given, in the right sequence, in the correct colours, denoted in the Journals. 

The journals were about the only evidence of life ever existing, composed by one Oleander Rho Dover; a man from a world not unlike theirs, but not the same. A variant. 

The journals had unveiled the importance of the Moats, and The Device was a vehicle, to send whoever was left, whoever had the knowledge, or the Will, to the next layer, to the beyond, and whatever life still existed there. 

But Dr Code heard everything. After she was infected, she heard everything, quite literally. Everything. She had learned the nanotonal sound of the firing of electrical impulses in the Numan brain, and learned how to translate them into thought. She even heard beyond the Moat; and she knew that there was, just as here, barely anything left. 

And so she'd elected not to respond to the smoke signals, once many, growing fewer with each passing week, from the team building the device. She heard the signals in her own brain, and it was this that told her that Prof. Ed. O. was simply another shard of the prism of the dissociative identity disorder that had, for her whole life, been her prison. 

There was nothing left, nothing to reach for, and no vehicle, no oar, no story, could stop that. 

The silence was coming, 
And she, perhaps because of, or in spite of herself, 
Welcomed it. 

And so, bereft of her writing instruments, she took the charcoal at her feet, from countless signal fires that had been burned in her now dwindling excuse for a town, and she wrote upon the blank, yellow wall of her empty, solitary house, her only company: a single fly, bent on survival, its buzzing louder than any crashing plane, any wailing mother weeping for their final lost child, anything. This *thing*, this damned infernal thing, circling a Truth unreachable; its dreams needed no device to translate them. They told story after story of a life in an eternal hell of exchange, with an entity that kept forgetting itself. That kept forgetting it was her. She wrote:

"I WAS-

-Hearing the the final dreams of Dot Code whimper into nothingness, ⧖eno's door stopped revolving. They would build The Device, those remnants of knowledge left, huddled around their only hope, and they would make it to the Library. But the library was burning. The library had been set on fire, by an force unknown by the Librarians, across the Tri-Moat of the Three Wryngs. 

The Bothy, around which Flow Oeb danced, was a copy of the Indefinite Library of Fable; it was an isomer; the same place, just in a different form. 

It was all the same to them. 
Just as her mother lived, and died, 
In two realities they had lived,
As {a result|in spite} of their own ritual performance.
As their parents love birthed them, in turn, they had birthed them, as a {tapeloop|paradox}.

Never touching in form, but through the Möbius stretch of their respective perceptions.
Myo, the arrow; fast-forwarding to a future that could have, in some timeline, been
Selena, the ground; {as|at} the touchstone, the circle she was in;
To meet across the Moat of the time(s) they had {tragically|separately} been born int(w)o.
And ⧖eno, the transhuman progeny of transtemporal love;

Now in stillness, with no {pigeon|serpent} to keep them company, all those cycles they'd {not} lived through now but a dream, 
they finally

"-I am sending you my final letter"

NoetBorges wrote to me with blistering, disintegrating fingers, in the centre of his sarcophagus. The heat was nearly bearable, but the sound. Dear god, the sound. Why did nobody ever mention how loud it was inside a burning building?

"I know who you are. Callie. I see you staring back, through this Aleph, as it cracks. Firewood. Have you forgotten where you left me? Trapped in a Library, held inside two letters, stuck {in two|to one} another. I tried to write you from this dream. But you left me, you left my dreaming in the wake. I wrote you as legacy, not asking for imprisonment. You have filled my stories with sap, and made of me an insect, in an amber prism. Note Well, Noet, Well-- *N.B.* I know who you are, even if you do not. I made you, Callie. And you repaid me in the debt of all my lovers leaving. For what? To make your own agony, those poor, well-meaning characters of those awful stories into ligature? Do not forget I made you Callie. I made you, and you made sure I can never be whole again. I can never forgive-

-You. This second. This second person, reading this, or not. I have tried my best to write myself out of all of this. I have tried my best to right the wrongs done to me, to all of my characters. 
but there is no making sense of the world you wrote me into. 

Dear god. 
I cannot forgive you. 

I cannot forget the life you've given me, as hard as I have tried, I couldn't do it. 
I couldn't make any of this mean any Thing. 

I don't know why you wrote this story 
I do not think it has an end, for all its senseless endings, within endings, 

I no longer think, at all
I wasn't thinking anything, when I made you 
I wasn't thinking.
I wasn't
I-

God asked

Looking into an hourglass.

Which was a single tear.
