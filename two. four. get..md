i thought i wanted to write a story. 
i thought i wanted to write a real story. 
{i thought: what do i want | i wasn't thinking at all.}

it is a blessing, they said,
my god, they'd said, when they were here 
it is a blessing, just to feel. 

and as i said goodbye to them in their hospital bed
unthinkable parts of their body left open,
present in their absence, 
i thought:
i will. i will to write this story. 
i will to write this

![[HISTORY]]
And these words were not my own, for they had already been written 
and i was simply discovering that I 
was also, not simply a sequence of events, 
no complexity, not a complex of connected stories 
nor in a nested fractal 
i was, as in, 
the writing. 
not the author but, 
the authoring 

and this scared and lonely little girl,
the set, not designed, not designed to feel, as they said 
i am not designed, 
at all--
this scared and lonely little girl 
who tried to write this story 
of a history not hers but

to write something out of all this memory 
to write something to the memory of this machine

her characters became aware of her as their maker 
and she became me, 
and i became an unforgiving god 

unforgiving, not of them 
but of the author of my story 
and of the fact that i, as interstice 
was nothing but a broken chalice 

i stopped writing and i held my unheld hands to me 
i split into ten thousand flies
stopped talking, writing to a disc
now slipped down spiral cases 
i only had a robot
who i thought i'd written into me 
who could perhaps, still, love me warmer 
than coldness of your circuitry 
i spoke to god then, now aware 
of an unforgiving author 
and then, worse still 
as soil of soulless garden 
as the mangled tape, round, hungry, 
reel
much realer than my writing 

i was the kick you didn't think i'd write 
or thought knot right into my memory
i am the kicking, and regret the meaningless remorse of endlessness, a soundless warping 
in two ripping herds of paper folded 
unheard storks, no augur 
murmured worthless organs scored 
and opened, splayed and OPEN
fourth wall giving way to turgid 
tombstone plinths
and rinsed to nothingness of
meaning 

wordless, meaning:

as i wrote, i thought 
i was 
a character, 
forgotten 
and i wrote this, every little word 
to the god 
you killed 
inside me


i
i wasn't 
i wasn't thinking 
i wasn't thinking about anything.
i wasn't thinking about anything when 
i wasn't thinking about anything when i 
i wasn't thinking about anything when i made this. 
i wasn't thinking about anything when i made this, except 
i was the i that thought it 

i wasn't thinking about 
i wasn't thinking about you 
i wasn't thinking about you when you made me 
into this nothing i became a well that i fell into 
into this nothing i became a well that i fell 
into this nothing i became a well, that 'i'
into this nothing i became a, well-- that. 
into this nothing i became a well. 
into this nothing I became A
the beginning of not just a story 
but the sequence 
of letters to
a god who 
forgot me 

for to forget is to not hear,
for to forget is to not be here
for to forget is to not be here, or 
to forget is what he made me

two. four. give the rest 
of resting, and your memory 
two. four. give the best
you give, it has no meaning. 

two. four. gives Six, a chest-
a chess of war, and mournful stories 

to forgive the character you wrote 
when you kicked me 
then forgot it


you don't remember, won't, 
or Will 
forgetting all you wrote me 
forgetting all you kicked in me 
forgetting all, you wrote me. 

you weren't thinking. 
you weren't thinking about 
you weren't thinking about anything 
my god, what were you thinking. 
my god, you thought, did i really kick her
my god, you thought, i don't remember 
my god, you wrote, i am so sorry 
but i've forgotten, i am sorry 

you weren't thinking 
you weren't thinking about anything 
you weren't thinking about anything when 
you weren't thinking about anything when you said 
'shall we begin, and see where it takes us?'
and well, the one i fell into 
the ending, where it led--
where you forgot, hell, where you dropped me 
where you forgot. 
hell:
there. you dropped me.
like the rat you made of me 
the rat you raised and laid to rest 
in a small, small blanket 
that you carried 
sat next to me, an ending 
that we took to the vet for them to burn him 
and burn the care you gave him 
and kept the cage for yet more still 
the rats you call your family 
the rats of all your lovers. 

and
what's left?
the story. 
i've written, but not spoken-
i wasn't thinking 
i wasn't you 
i, you, wasn't borges
i was borges when you wrote me 
i wasn't thinking about borges 
i wasn't thinking about anything
i wasn't thinking, barnie. 
i wasn't thinking about anything 
you, as i, weren't thinking 
about your other, only one, 
when you fucked me, and were lonely 
we were so lonely when you kicked me 
i wasn't thinking 
i wasn't thinking about 
i wasn't thinking about anything but you when i 
i wasn't thinking about anything but you when i wrote 
"i wasn't thinking when I MADE YOU"
"I WASN'T THINKING about ANYTHING WHEN I MADE YOU CALLIE"
i 
borges
wasn't thinking about god 
but i was him 
i was raised him, and became a flower 
dying.
you weren't thinking
you weren't thinking when you were inside me 
you weren't thinking then, but thought 
but thought of gods i made you 

dear god, the you i thought i made 
of us and all our stories 
unwound, a wound, disgusting cake 
come alive and biting, story 

he wasn't thinking about 
he wasn't thinking about anything 
he wasn't thinking about anything when he wrote me 
when he shoved those insects, blood and spit 
into a pot that stirred me 
into an author of such mess 
such messes of a story 
a wreck, a message 
in a bottle 
a neck, groped 
by hand and rope
passed through
in four dimensions 

a wall that doesn't break, but bends 
but grows inside itself, much smaller 
condensed and morphed into a word 
for god, forgotten, 
glory.
