<u>The Device</u>

Numanity was now at the endpoint[^end] that its self-same, {in{finitely|separable}|credibly different} components are still {(,) Yet(,)|To Be} unaware of-- the formation of a fully op{era}tional Universe, nested with{in|out} this One. 

At some unknowable Future, now passed[^pass], The Device {Fig. I} of the Wor{l}d is Made Flesh, having sapped the Wor{l}d of its imaginary[^im] resource[^res], the futile, unfulfillable promise to Pay The Bearer (Money); An uncountable team of The Worlds' Scientists and Thinkers were gathered Around, and indeed within, The Device's Epicentre. The First whisperings of this Final Invention have already been laid; and the progression of the experience of Time itself merely an illusion. Time exists, or not, in order[^oe] to package Nowness into a indefinite, yet discrete set of Moments-- with the purpose of affording our Three Dimensional Selves the opportunity to relish, savour and honour the infinite One Moment[^mo]. Thus is the Price of Forgetting.

To Remember, 
One Must First Forget. 

Whirring with a terrifying lightning storm overhead (an unavoidable side-effect of The Device, according to {REDACTED}) The Device was Building a Universe.
