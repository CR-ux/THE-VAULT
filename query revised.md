I hope this email finds you well—or at least, the right kind of unwell for what follows.

I’m seeking representation for _TWO. FOUR. GIVE._, a 99,666-word speculative literary novel that fuses experimental narrative architecture, trans mythopoeia, and recursive horror. It’s a queer story of memory, identity, and linguistic resurrection—blurring the line between novel, archive, and invocation.

The story opens in six sealed rooms, where four characters—named for the base pairs of DNA—awaken with no memory, communicating only through a one-way system of vents and footnoted marginalia. What unfolds is a mutagenic narrative: self-replicating, self-aware, and spiraling through constructed languages, familial trauma, and nested fictions. Part choose-your-own-adventure, part ontological trapdoor, the novel challenges the reader to become not only witness, but participant—both archivist and architect of its recursive loop.

I believe this project aligns with your interest in formally inventive and emotionally resonant fiction. I’d be honored to send you the full manuscript, as well as a PDF version designed with custom scripting to reflect the work’s page-as-performance modality.

Thank you so much for your time and consideration.
Warmly,
Callie Rose Petal
