> "█miss her
> The last smell of her, in that dream
> Where she, running down an impossibly steep
> Bicycle trail upon which █was skating
> Vertically
> Upward,
> In the middle place we meet
> Speechless, █stop
> She places her soft chocolate brown head
> Brown eyes
> Deep,
> Unconditional loving, seeing every part of me
> Upon my legs (now seated on the sideways ground, no prevailing thought of gravity)
> And sniffing like so oft █did
> The unmissable, delicious scent of my favourite living being ever to have walked this earth
> Oh God, Oh Goddess, this little chunky fluffy thing
> █miss you, sweetest one
> She rests her head upon my lap and █kiss her and in that moment in between the infinitely divisible eternity, a moment, infinite,
> We are saying farewell,
> Or, at least,
> Until next time –"
