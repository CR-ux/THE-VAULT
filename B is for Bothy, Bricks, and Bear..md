B is for Bothy[^b] 


on The 23rd Day-

of the Twelfth Month-

of Twenty Twenty Three-

Inside A Bothy-  a small shack of wood in the back garden of a Sound Engineer-

Which wasn't a forest, but was, when facing a certain direction-

There was a dying blaze in the iron coffin of a hearth-

In futility, we did our best-

To keep it alive with crumpled newspaper and stoking rods-

It wasn't Christmas, but it verily almost was-

It wasn't a Family, but it was the closest I had felt-

Lying, on the almost-mezzanine floor-

Where we were both too tall to even sit-

Underneath which, we were both too tall to even stand-

They fucked me, once, not like those times I lost count-

But out of a duty colder than the outside air-

That we barricaded ourselves against-

We tried, our unbanked, dwindling embers tired-

I will always remember the strike of my waking from that dream-[^yellow]

That unreeled mattress beneath us, so harsh and unforgiving-

Rushing in such panic to leave the place in time-

I couldn't find my contact lenses; I couldn’t see; they were so angry- we were both so angry 

about how little time we had left—

I was always just so sorry for my insufficiency, 

never seeing how much they regretted theirs-

I was her. Lying there, dying, waiting for water-

I was regret,

a scary little not-insect 

Telling secrets in inexplicable sweat;

And as much as I try I’ll never forget[^myself]

My first childhood pet, A Chilean Rose Tarantula-

And they were me, a child- doing the best they could to not neglect me-
Just a hairy, complicated little thing, so difficult to look, after-

To protect me, nourish me with the flies they could find, 

to surround me with whatever crickets I could bear the chirping songs of -

And we were Twenty Three Years Ago.

[^NB]:much like that story that Borges once told; where he meets his younger self on a bench on a cliff overlooking an Ocean that was all fading into a homogenous Yellow in his dwindling vision but ever-blossoming Vision: he said something like "Alas, we could never get along. We were too alike; the image of our Selves in reflection, abominable, and one of us, was destined, doomed, to become the Other[^bench]
