In the dream, which was [[Script]]ed, [[Knot]] from a dream. From a Story of a Letter to a Character, [[Born]] of Two Letters with [[Opposing]] [[Character]]s, based on the [[Translation]] into [[Letter]]s from the [[Codon]]s of the [[Transcript]] of the [[Thread]]s of [[String]]s of Lettered [[Life]] we [[Know]] as Reæl,

I was back on the [[Train]].
The Train is, of course, as everything in All Three Worlds, a Symbol.[^sy]

I was somewhere near the [[Back]] of the train, and it was horribly [[Empty]].

Perhaps reflecting my recent Kidnapping in the [[Wake]] of the world, I was kept within this [[Machine]] against my [[Will]]; filled with a [[Terror]] of [[Rapture]]d [[Consent]], all too [[Familiar]].

Eventually, the Rear-[[End]] (3' Directive) Driver, who would later be revealed to be [[One]] of [[Three]], Made Himself [[Noen]] to me. 

I begged Him to [[Stop]] the train, not entirely knowing from where the urgency for the request came. And yet, He did not [[Yield]].

I began to traverse the [[String]] of [[Carriage]]s. 
The Constituent Compartments of the Train seemed to be Replicating[^E], [[Metastasising]], and I soon began to [[Believe]] that the [[Front]] of the Train was unreachable; at some Ever-Becoming Terminus[^t]. 

Nevertheless, it came to [[Pass]] that I had somehow come to a [[Penultimate]] Carriage, the Face of this Mechanical [[Beast]] just in view, past this hollow and terrifying cuboid I had suddenly entered - it was fashioned as a Cage, rattling - as I became a Rat, a feral Cageling. 

And yet, there was a certain surrender in my temperament, watching the [[Cruel and Barrelling Train]]'s Exoskeleton Shudder, Shiver, as I, Shackled within, allowed myself to be thrown about, becoming Bruised and Pinched by the Openings and Welded Edges of the Chris{t}-[[Cross]]ed Bars. 

And then, a certain salvation, in the [[Open]]ing of the Driver's Door in front of me. Two female figures,

Uncle (brutal rejection of my transness; active negative force), Cousin (estranged, indifferent, lawyer, cold, unfeeling, boistrous male counterpart to Maiden; neutral force/space), Dad - (Distant father, really trying to accept but unable to, avoidant; passive positive force) - Archetypal Male triptych (X, Y, Z )


Google Maps had a function which resulted in Teleportation following clicking a location, my dad and I were being thrown from location to location and about to die from falling from a great height, until I quickly, last minute, clicked a location above an ocean/lake; resulting in us both Falling into Water. My father seemed to disapprove of this, wondering why we didn't just go straight to the place we needed to, and I was protesting, saying "we would have died if I didn't choose a Body of Water."

Because in the [[Wake]] of This World, The World He thought He'd built for me, In The Wake of Us, 
With No Choice,
I Chose 
a Body of Water.

The Lighthouse - Khopi , a dreamspace to which I very rarely return.
It is often the sight of intellectual entities, working together in secret, inside of a lighthouse; which i surrounded by a fibonacci spiral train track; only accessible via the train mentioned in part One. Which I desperately wanted to alight. 

This is regularly the only place (in multi-location or nested dreams) that I am able to fly, or affect my gravity; I have only ever flown twice in dreams, or rather, once, and half a time, during a recent dream, which still burns into my memory with astonishing clarity and colour. 

It is now that I realise I do in fact dream in colour. I wonder what this means for my Spirit, as I circulate the Light as best I can; as I realise my child of Yesterday was not bleeding, but rather, had dipped the blindspot of his nose in Oil paint, of bright red, containing heavy metals poisonous to him. And I wonder, in this Now of Nows - which is Worse? Which is a greater example of my insufficiency as a Mother? Of my Truth as a Maiden? Of My Lies as a Crone?

Two more female figures, perhaps the aged versions of the Drivers; Sat with me upon a bench within this Trine of the Dream Triptych, which was outside, but also within a humble cafe upon the cliff's edge. 

And then, within this dream, Near-Flying, Falling face first into jutting Rocks; and in my abandonment of self-preservation; I became the Mother; 
The Mother, birthing yet another Trinity of Dreamscapes, Nested as Three Birds, Auguring- this Final Terminus of Dreams::


- Noodle, child - for once he was not harmed; but kept escaping into the apartment complex I have been within many times; which resembles my first home away from my childhood one; where I would be constantly smoking weed, in a sustained haze, making lofi music in my bedroom, beginning this unthinkably strange journey, descent and then ascent into and from my most dizzying creations; such as this one, born from Dream upon Shattered Prisons of Dreams within Shepherded Prisms of Unshakable Nightmares. This apartment complex was not complex at all, but a simple labyrinth, confusing enough to need to collect myself for a moment, to remember which space I had come to call my own
