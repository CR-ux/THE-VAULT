AUTHOR'S NOET
===

*As creators begot from Creator, we forge Creators in the form of Characters, from Characters known as Letters. These Characters we Create are formed of the building blocks (letters A, C, T and G), which allow us to write more letters of our own (Alphabets). These characters made of letters, are of such a character as to render ourselves, as creators, 'fictional', or imagined, by the perception of the Reader, as some parasocially divined essence running through the Characters' stories. The Story of This author and of all authors, is of all time. The Reader of this Story is just as much an Author of their own; but it is only in the Reading of the Story that the Author of the Story that is being written is Rendered as a Story in their own right, and the theretofore 'fictional' beings imagined by their Author, swap their 'Reality' status with the being in the creative dimension 'above' (which is also below), and this process 'inhales' and 'exhales' with every infinitesimal 'slice' of infinite 'duration'. This principle is reflected in higher dimensional geometry, which shows us that our perception of a single 'slice' of 4D objects (i.e. duration, evolution of Meaning, the formation of memory, the Breathing of our own perception, both singular and collective as One - this [[Perception]] of [[Reality]] is arguably more 'accurate' (or at the very least, more granular) than the hypothetical perception of a Fourth-Dimensional Being, who sees past, present, future, and all possible iterations and timelines of such, all at once - just as we see all Three dimensions, height, length, and depth, as One, only rendered on a Two-Dimensional plane, due to the Two-Dimensional nature of the layer of retinal cells at the back of our eyes. 

However, as I write this, and because I am writing this, I am perceiving said 'Truth'. In writing about it, I write it into Beingness, which, in turn, in my reading of my writing, becomes Non-Beingness, or potential, once more. This is how evolution, not just of Form, not just of Biology or Physical Law, occurs. This is how the nature of reality itself Breathes itself in and out of Being. 

The Breath of God dreaming. Each moment of Perceiving true Nowness, within any being, causes this 'Breath' to halt, and for just a single Quantum of Fourth Dimensional movement, the Universe's inmost and outmost Dimensionality collapses, and expands into the infinite Standstill. Now, imagine the (erroneously insufficient, yet paradoxically necessary) 'movement' of these periods of 'Standstill', throughout all infinite possibilities of every multiverse. This itself is a Breath, a binary Ocean of Ones and Zeroes, Switching themselves {On|Off}, Weaving {In|Out}.
