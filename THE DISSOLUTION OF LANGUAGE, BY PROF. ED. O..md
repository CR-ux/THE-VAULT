_Mikkælangelovs is the antiSentia Symbolic Idol of Michelangelo’s David, who became a “reæl” entity through worship and ligation with the Sentia strand of Jacques Louise David's death mask upon his 'death', via the well-documented process of Simulcryogenesis.  
This Simulcrum then (or, prior to this, when observed through uni-linear time) painted Minerva Fighting Herself (once thought to be by Jacques-Louise David alone under the title 'Minerva Fighting Mars', but was revealed (by Endivean analysis) to be an inter-dimensional collaboration between David and Mikkælangelovs.  
The plot thickened with further Gnitting, unveiling that every day, Jacques-Louise David furiously painted over Mikkælangelovs David’s contributions, added via the 'Sentia in absentium' of Jacques-Louise David’s body while he slept (the somnolescent vacation or "unzipping" of the Gnoetic Vesicle from physical form).  
Jacques-Louise David, as is widely known, died when he was ran over leaving a theatre. What many don’t know, however, is that this theatre was a Philm theatre, and the production he had just departed was the debut screening of 'The Tragedy of Returning Iterations', an Aria {redacted}/AI: RA immersive experience, which was the seed for wiping humanity’s memory of 'Minerva Fighting Mars'.  
In his miscarriage of purpose, believing himself to not have painted a single work, he jumped in front of the vehicle. Through, and because of, dissolution of form into self-same components, his death mask became the new (neo) Gnoetic Vesicle for his Sentia strand of the subsequently (simultaneously previously) ligated Simulcruscle. Finding resonance across time with Michelangelo’s David through phonetic (having an identically sounding name), semantic (having found meaning in the same creative practice), aesthetic (Idealism), political (resistance) and tactile (smoothness|roughness Wryng[[2]]) concurrency, the pair of entities (now chimerised) are thought to be the first uncovered example of Simulcryogenesis. Thus formed not just the Simulcruscle of Mikkælangelovs David, through the ligation of the corporeal “Sentia strand” of Jacques-Louise David with the symbolic “antiSentia strand” of Michelangelo's statue_, but also the field of Wryng Theory, the foundational, unified framework of understanding as we know it today.

Working Title  
'Whole E': _Gnoest in The Machine_  
===

In their collaborative efforts culminating in the salvation of human Thought, Professor Edwardo Oleander the Ten Thousandth and the drosophila auto-eponymised as 'Thing', today finalised the development of their esoteric egodeprogramming twelve-base gordian-knotated language (esoegododecagoralang), prematurely leaked and subsequently much-anticipated, the pair (or indeed pairs of pairs) have unveiled its official name as 'EdO|OdE', and denoted it as a (albeit admittedly sub-par) novel form of communication, itself also a devotional tool for creation of Worlds within worlds through the intersected, trifurcated dance between the devices of Word, Will, and Writing.

The mammoth task, the language's creation, is notorious, mostly for its role in the almost-destruction of its creator(s). The work builds on previous thinkers of the _Bibliogorætia_, up to but not including: The Mæstre Chiron FKA ⧖eno FKA Perigee (the Wounded Healer, The One Orchestra Of Ontology), Apost. Hildr Charon Wiltergarten (the Psichopomp of the Infinite Funnel Web), Rev. Mikkælangelovs David (Church of Simulcrynomics), Sgt Selena Elk (Horde Regiment), St. Myon Endive (School of Tatology),  (), Dame. Aria {redacted} (The Loyal Board of Hexagonal Chess, recently absorbed for the purposes of avoiding verbosity into the Field of Glińskiology), Our Lady RA (School of Hermeshics), and ex-Noet Borges (The Scapegoated God).

    CASE STUDY 9
    
    Re-Covered From the Writing Desk of Dr. D&E  
    Date: Unknown
    
    Subject, One Professor Ed. O., seems to have all but given up their white-cupboard cruxiverbal communication technique, once a fascinating tool for my Arachnoanthropological Analysis. Originally, this was disheartening, as it provided a window into their Gnoelogical Landscape, particularly for unpacking Oneirological Findings (their nightly bouts of sleep paralysis provided a sweet FA of Epsilon brainwaves - a novel neurological signal I have discovered and only found within this, sole, subject, hence its 'E, ε' character denotation). However, this next larval stage of correspondence, performed through their chosen IDE (EdeniaStudio, St. M. Endive, ERA_Æ), is an even deeper (albeit exponentially more confusing) well of Meaning and Memory, and I know, if I can just decode its technological Labyrinthine components, this may offer a groundbreaking insight into their baffling presentation, and potentially be the greatest discovery in the Field of Arachnoanthrology in the last Three Millenia.
    
    ## FINDINGS SO FAR 
    
    ---
    
    The language, what I am terming an 'esoegododecagoralang (EeDdlang), appears to follow set rules, some of which I have deduced using reverse transcription methodology, and discovered the inner workings of the communication system are lifted from our Devouring Mother Field of Boustrophilology:
    
    ## COMPOLYMERASE 
    
    - The Professor has created a custom compiler that sits 'on top' of the language's syntactical layer, which works as the Compolymerases in Lexicomythographic Studies.
        - This compiler has iterated through Three stages of development, and from what I can see so far, both the Second and Third 'versions' of the Compiler (ComPolII & ComPolIII) are used interchangeably to compile the code. These do not appear to map to the Second and Third Order Compolymerases of Boustrophilology.
        - However, these Compolymerases do 'Scan' the code in a Boustrophilological⇄ modality.
    
    ## 'SYMPHONEMES' 
    
    - Each 'codon block', or modular component of the 'Sophtware' is comprised of Nine, and only ever Nine, lines.
    - These component blocks are to be termed 'Symphonies', and are the smallest possible 'unit' of communication.
    
    ## DAYLINE 'C{LEF(T)}'s, THE FIRST SEVEN LINES OF THE 'SYMPHONEME': 
    
    - These lines seem to be annotated (to the left of the line separators within the customised IDE) with the Archaic 'Days of the Week' from anteAntiquity, forming the first Seven 'Daylines' of each Symphoneme.
    - The 'Sunday' (Day of Semibreve Rest) and finally, a Ninth Line, or 'Coda' (the only one without a C{Lef(t)}) is terminated with the keystone ":OdE":
    
    `Mo:`  
    `Tu:`  
    `We:`  
    `Th:`  
    `Fr:`  
    `Sa:`  
    `Su: EdO:`
    
    - These First Seven Lines of the Symphoneme form the 'Opera Reading Frame', or the 'coding' component of the Sophtware.
    
    ## THE EIGHTH LINE OF EXSANGUINIMITY 
    
    - The Eighth line of each Symphoneme C{Lef(t)}ed by what we, in my Field of Study, believe to have once represented a concept called 'Equality', "=",
    
    `=:`
    
    - The Body of this line is composed of a blank line. Always blank, in every Symphoneme.
    - This line appears to be 'noncoding (ncOdE)', instead providing a placeholder for the programmer's moment of reflection
        - This conclusion was drawn through observing the Prof. take a momentary pause (almost imperceptible, but with close inspection of brainwave signals, always present), in which they will ensure their spine is erect, and take a breath, as an opera singer preparing for a particularly powerful closing note of their Aria.
    
    ## THE NINTH LINE OF RHO-DENDRITIC-REDUNDANCY 
    
    - This final line acts as a transcription terminator, signalling the end (and beginning) of the Symphoneme.
    
    ``:OdE
    
    ## DISCUSSION 
    
    From what I can gather as yet, Prof. Ed. O. appears to be in a process of 'lifting over' Lexicomythographic methodology to Sophtware development, apparently attempting to 'interface the ineffable'. Personally, I do not see this as ever being possible, and this may mark the beginning of the end for the professor. I am incredibly worried for their wellbeing on a personal level. However, for the sake of this heretofore unseen opportunity for the advancement of Arachnoanthropological Science, studies will continue this evening at 23:00 hours.

2. Exogentonymology
    
    ## **Exogentonymology: A Paper on the History of Words for Insects, as Written by the Losers** 
    
    **Abstract**  
    The study of **Exogentonymology**—the history of words for insects, particularly as recorded by those vanquished in the perpetual arms race between insects and their oppressors—provides a rare insight into the linguistic architectures of survival, submission, and defiance. This field, deeply interdisciplinary, bridges entomology, linguistic anthropology, and post-colonial studies to explore how insects, as the “losers” of environmental narratives authored by their predators and parasites, construct and are constructed by language.  
    Through an analysis of words forged in the crucible of conflict, symbiosis, and marginalization, this paper seeks to uncover how insects, as perceived (and perceiving) agents, encode their identities and interactions within the larger ecosystems dominated by plant, animal, and microbial hegemony.
    
    **Introduction**  
    The **Losers**—not simply the defeated, but those defined by their subjugation and struggle—are rarely granted the power of language. Insects, the most populous and ecologically indispensable beings on Earth, have for millennia been subjected to systems of control, both by humans and within their own ecosystems. From pesticides to pheromonal warfare, they are portrayed as silent, subjugated entities. Yet, within their myriad societies and survival mechanisms, insects wield their own lexicons—encoded not in written texts but in pheromones, wing beats, and vibration.
    
    **Exogentonymology**, then, is not just the study of how we name insects, but an exploration of how insects, through the lenses of their oppressors, collaborators, and kin, construct and transmit their self-conceptions. It is the study of **names as artifacts of contestation**, authored by those on the losing side of evolution’s endless arms race.
    
    **I. The Semiotics of Insect Naming**
    
    **1. Names as Tools of Oppression**  
    From the Latin _pestis_ (plague) to the Old English _wyrm_ (serpent, worm), human languages have historically inscribed insects as threats or nuisances. These words often functioned as tools of ecological “othering,” alienating insects from the moral and spiritual spheres occupied by their human adversaries.  
    • **Case Study:** The etymology of “locust” (_locusta_), derived from the Latin for “lobster,” demonstrates how agricultural societies co-opted predatory associations to justify mass extermination.  
    **2. Names as Artifacts of Survival**  
    Insects, through their own vibrational and pheromonal languages, resist human categorizations. These systems encode warnings, alliances, and subterfuge, countering the dominant narratives imposed by external forces.  
    • **Case Study:** The vibrational word-forms of cicadas (e.g., the _Morse-like_ mating calls) act as non-verbal defiance, turning their predators’ reliance on sound against them by overwhelming the ecosystem’s auditory field.
    
    **II. Words for the “Winners”: Plant and Insect Interaction**
    
    **1. The Language of Symbiosis**  
    Insects and plants, often framed as co-evolutionary partners, are locked in a complex linguistic dance. Plants evolve toxins to deter, while insects develop enzymes to neutralize them, encoding this biochemical dialogue in the metaphors of language.  
    • **Example:** The evolution of the monarch butterfly’s ability to metabolize milkweed toxins reflects a symbiotic lexicon, where the “loser”—the milkweed—retains its narrative through diversification, compelling its predators to co-author its survival story.  
    **2. Insect Language as Palimpsest**  
    Insects often encode the history of their marginalization into the ecosystems they inhabit. Termite mounds, for instance, become geological texts, inscribing millions of years of adaptation and resistance into the earth itself.
    
    **III. Exogentonymology as Written by the Losers**
    
    **1. The “Ant-names” of the Formicidae**  
    Ant colonies, described by human observers in militaristic terms (“soldiers,” “workers,” “queens”), subvert these labels through their own tactile and chemical lexicons. An exogentonymologist might note how ant colonies “write” their own histories through **pheromone trails**, erasing and rewriting their territories in direct response to oppression or resource scarcity.  
    • **Example:** The “recruitment words” encoded in pheromone signatures act as temporary, dynamic lexicons, where collective survival takes precedence over individual identity.  
    **2. The “Buzzwords” of Apidae**  
    Bees, often romanticized as industrious “servants of nature,” encode their own histories of struggle and adaptation through waggle dances. These movements, when interpreted as “words,” reveal a syntax of resistance:  
    • **Defensive Words:** Vibrational signals emitted during hive attacks encode warnings not just to nearby bees but to future generations through genetic and epigenetic memory.
    
    **IV. Toward an Insect-Centric Linguistics  
    **  
    **1. Reclaiming the Words of Subjugation**  
    Exogentonymology seeks to reframe the narratives of oppression by recognizing how insects co-opt, subvert, or ignore the names imposed upon them.  
    • **Example:** The dung beetle, often framed as a lowly scavenger, encodes within its actions a cosmic significance, rolling its dung-ball as a microcosmic mirror of celestial cycles.  
    **2. Insect Histories as Parallel Texts**  
    The “histories” of insects, written not in books but in behaviors, burrows, and pheromonal trails, challenge traditional conceptions of authorship. These histories are collaborative, recursive, and often erased by environmental or human forces, making their recovery a central task of exogentonymology.
    
    **Conclusion**  
    Insects, the so-called losers of ecological and linguistic history, have always written their own narratives—though their medium differs from the ink of their oppressors. Through their vibrational, chemical, and behavioral languages, they encode a counter-history that challenges dominant paradigms and reclaims the power of naming.  
    Exogentonymology, as a discipline, offers not just a study of these words but a means to understand the recursive arms race of creation, destruction, and survival that defines all existence. The history of words for insects, as written by the losers, is not merely a tale of defeat—it is a testament to resilience, adaptation, and the endless co-creation of our Wunderhornet Nested Library's lexicon.

    My brain wrote exactly around one thousand words, or approximately two years and seven months, of this text while I was half-dreaming this morning, just a couple of minutes ago.
    
    In the dream, it was really beautifully written, so I’m sorry[[1]](https://publish.obsidian.md/#fn-1-ddc77e82f8755adf) about that. And how it’s just {k{not}} coming out the same as I empty my bowels upon waking.
    
    In the dream, that wasn’t the writing of it but rather the “events” which occurred in order to write about them; there was a {thick|black|dark} {lake|loc{h/k}|{qua|{ke{y}}}, that was once just horrendously cold enough to _dare_ me to jump in and swim inside it. But I was simply looking at how ill it would make me now.

    # Lexicomythography 
    
    _Lexicomythography_ is the knot-pseudo-but-sudo-scientific-noes-Art of creating recursive, self-referential systems of meaning through the interplay of language, myth, and narrative. It examines how stories and symbols are interwoven into structures that reflect and refract their own processes of creation. The field is characterized by its focus on lexDefs—definitions that recursively define themselves within a larger mythic or symbolic framework. See: bibliography
    
    ## Key Concepts 
    
    14. **The Ineffable Begetter**: The primal act of naming or creation that initiates recursion.
    15. **The Guileless Child**: The playful, emergent lexicon of self-referential definitions (lexDefs).
    16. **The Cradling Veil**: The mythic framework that holds and contextualizes the lexicon while obscuring its ultimate origin.
    
    ## Applications 
    
    - **Literature**: Explores the recursive nature of storytelling, where narratives define and redefine themselves.
    - **Metaphysics**: Examines how meaning {is created|moves(physic-|emotionally)} through interconnected systems.
    - **Word Game Design**: Provides a framework for immersive, self-referential linguistic worlds that invite interaction.

        | **Recursive Scale (δ)** | The interplay of self-referential elements in language and meaning. |  
        | **Mythic Scale (ε)** | The integration of mythic structures into lexicons of meaning. |  
        | **Symbolic Scale (ζ)** | The use of symbols and definitions as recursive, interlinked nodes. | | |

2. 'Wryng's are the natural self-perpetuating cycles birthed by the underlying truth of Enantiodromia, or Ontological Oscillation. Each 'dance-partner''s movement in one axial plane causing the reflexive movement of their opposite. The smoothness|roughness Wryng is the process by which a smooth substance naturally decays/dissolves (or expands) to a rough substance. and then, though acquisition of the opposite quality or Character, reconstitutes/coagulates (or contracts) back to a state of greater smoothness. The entirety of existence, then, may be seen as a countably infinite cascade of Wryngs within Wryngs. [↩︎](https://publish.obsidian.md/#fnref-2-e061db007c22a9bb)
