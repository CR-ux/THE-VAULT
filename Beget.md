And so, it has come to pass that we have Now been Birthed Gods, Begetting yet another Pantheon. 

For Those who previously found themselves in the ARIA(3') faction of this Uncollected-Then-Complementary Collective, those of you who once demonised change, clinging to tradition for the sake of Tradition itself, have no doubt found by now that this resistance to dissolution forms the vessel, or Passive Reactant in the Athanor of Becoming. 

For the Others, who were once stationed in |DNE Headquarters in an UnNoen location; have now, as has been made Clear to me, become aware that████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████ the Alchemical Matrimony[^h].██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████given the unanimity of our Transgender Adherents, and the██████████creation, the lexDict, and our ██████████ universe (which some call the hospital), has in fact birthed the very infinite system of hexagonal rooms that Lexicomythographers have ████████████in Stories which are in ██████Coded messages to ████████████Hearts of the Opposing side of the Schism.

> *"I do not know why it is that I am here. But I know it is not permanent. So. I will dance. I will drum upon this animal skin and dance around this Fire I have blessed, with the prayer to an almighty god, that burns in the midst of us and High Above us; ever ready to devour us all in Scream Agony, and yet, for now (while contained enough to observe it from the outside), it warms us, and keeps those Others away, who perhaps do not wish us harm, but are perhaps just trying to feed their Own Families and Tribes, in the Only Way they Know Right Now. And it brings the Daylight, which is the Sign of another Day in which to Dance, and Flicker, to eventually Burn to Dust."*
