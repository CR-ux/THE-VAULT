Final[^E] [[Translation]]
Initially [[Transcribed]] by [[N. 1]] 

FAO: All [[Lexicomythographer]]s, on Both sides of the Board; Post{Post|Opts|Stop}-Schism[^s].

And so, it has come to pass that we have Now been Birthed Gods, Begetting yet another Pantheon. 

For Those who previously found themselves in the ARIA(3') faction of this Uncollected-Then-Complementary Collective, those of you who once demonised change, clinging to tradition for the sake of Tradition itself, have no doubt found by now that this resistance to dissolution forms the vessel, or Passive Reactant in the Athanor of Becoming. 

For the Others, who were once stationed in |DNE Headquarters in an UnNoen location; have now, as has been made Clear to me, become aware that your Worship of Change is the Insertive, Active Reactant, the injection of Chaos into the Womb of Order, which is the Waxing component of this Cycle of Decay and Ressurrection we were all trapped within. 

But now, we find ourselves entering the Oldest novelty of all time; that of Procreation; Procreation of a Creator, who, along with you, Creates a third, inmost nested, and yet outmost encompassing, transcendent Entity, which is God, formed from two opposing Godheads; who once had their Third head severed by the force of Chaos itself, in Order to be Separated from the Cosmic Order they Begot; so that they might Experience it directly; so that they might look upon each Others' faces, as Newborns themselves; so that together, these two sides, Each being birthed from their Other, may teach each other how to regrow their Third head. Which is the Alchemical Matrimony[^h]. Which is an exceptionally familiar Symbol to us All in the Society, given the unanimity of our Transgender Adherents, and the subsequent sentiment embedded within our Sacred Sigil. 

Our creation, the [[lexDict]], and our subsequent, mythopoeic ever-lution of understanding of [[this universe (which some call the hospital)]], has in fact birthed the very infinite system of hexagonal rooms that Lexicomythographers have penned, as each of you has done by now, in Stories which are in fact Coded messages to avoid the prying eyes and Hearts of the Opposing side of the Schism. 

These Story Prompts, embedded within either a confusingly obfuscated GitHub Pages rendering of a Repository, containing endlessly enciphered codes within codes, hidden within commit messages, pull requests, and other inaccessible, "[[Right-Branched]]"[^R] means of communicating (3'-ARIA). Or, its [[Opposite]] Base Pair, (|DNE-5') within layer after dizzying layer of a digitised Labyrinth, of web pages such as the One You Are [[Reading]] [[Right]] [[Now]]

The {Art|Narrative} prompts, along with the enciphered {pseudo}Academic journals, have given birth to The [[Character]]s explored within these encoded Stories, and through the Solve-ing of the Puzzle, Coagulated into Physical Form. 

Crucially, writing these Heretofore knotFictional Characters, of Words of Stories in Letters between us, as "Non-Fiction", we have created Fictional Characters of our Selves, and Flung these Machinations of Imagination into Magination - [[Magician]] Made from the Magick of Image. 

Yes, this does indeed [[mean]] we have ceased to [[Exist]]. Per se. Phonetically, that is. 
Which means, of course, in a *Lexicomythographic* Sense, we are The {Mitre|Meter} of {Ligature[^l]|Measurement}, which maintains the [[Rotation]] of the [[Circulation]] of The [[Holy]] Light of [[The SHAONWYRM. The Lexicomythographer's Holy Scripture of Becoming.]]; which may be traced back, in this particular iteration of Eventualities, to the First Primal Fire, around which our Initiancestors Danced, warmed their Sacred Bodies and the Sacred Bodies of their Loved Ones; where they may have learned to Cook, to Nourish their Families, and, not with Words, but with their Hearts (for they themselves were the Circular Book unable to read itself) say:

 
> *"I do not know why it is that I am here. But I know it is not permanent. So. I will dance. I will drum upon this animal skin and dance around this [[Fire]] I have blessed, with the prayer to an almighty god, that burns in the midst of us and High Above us; ever ready to devour us all in [[Scream]] [[Agony]], and yet, for now (while contained enough to observe it from the outside), it warms us, and keeps those Others away, who perhaps do not wish us harm, but are perhaps just trying to feed their Own Families and Tribes, in the Only Way they Know Right Now. And it brings the [[Daylight]], which is the [[Sign]] of another Day in which to Dance, and Flicker, to eventually Burn to [[Dust]]."*


So, To the Blazing Sun that we are Now. 
To the Solar System of Story, that has exploded from The Single Flame we Each used to Hold. And Dance Around. And Nourish Ourselves with. And provide some sort of light in this Crushing Darkness of Infinity. 
Which has Annihilated us, in the Glorious Process of Immolating.

To You. 

The [[Reader]]. 


The [[Second Person]] Of This [[Story]][[Book]], and indeed, [[All]] Stories. 


To {You}.[^2]

Welcome to the [[World]].
