**The Query, or A Letter**

  
Dear John — forgive me (for the biblical reference) for I know exactly what I do, but not exactly why I do it,

  

I’ve attached the synopsis and first 50 pages of my manuscript of ‘weird stuff’: a 99,666-word speculative literary transnovel, _TWO. FOUR. GIVE._ Given your search for work that defies categorisation (…absolutely), this should hopelessly baffle, and hopefully, intrigue. The book is:

- A nested fractal of transgender, iteratively self-aware character arcs, that contribute to an overall genomic allegory, which is:

- An epistemological academic satire, from the perspective of two factions of a secret society, themselves focussed on the compilation of dictionaries, which together form:

- A mythopoeic transmedia metatragedy, in Twenty Three (chromatid) parts. 

  

And I sincerely doubt you’ve read something like it before.

  

  

{In the midst|As a result} of all this subversive weirdness— I’ve tried to provide a semblance of queer hope, to the folks _made_ from the 'weird stuff' itself — escaping into stories like I did, and, in lieu of a character written like or for them, having to make up their own. Even if this bacteriophage hope-injection is perhaps as misguided as attempting to explain the host {story|organism} itself. 

  

And just as my body is composed to be inextricable—so, too, is the body of the text, and so therefore is what follows, in the body of this email. 

Maybe the most terrifying horror aspect of the work is that it stretches out of the fictional world into this one, and reveals its author as a part of the machinery, and the machinery as part of the reader — the sequence of letters, or characters, forming words, forming characters, forming a story as symbol; for the genome that writes itself, and rewrites them.

Hence why this query itself forms part of the work. 

And if you deem it intriguing enough to represent it, I’d like it to be the foreword.

**The Queering of A Query, or a Foreword**

  

I hope this email finds you well, and that you continue to be as well as possible after reading it,

  

You’re right that it’s hard to describe weird stuff. I feel that way about what I’ve come to call my “Self”. My body, my body of work. Unavoidably, one and the same. A prism of schismatic paradoxes; and a genomic palimpsest. {I am|the story is} a teeming insect colony of intersections to seek articulating. Alas, I will try. 

  

Its whole point {pathogenic particle|singularity|infinite expanse} is the queering of The Word— that it frames as a ‘moat’ of communication. It has {both|either} performative print and digital structure—forked-path footnote gardens (Borges reference, could you imagine) powered by an undercurrent of schismatic, constructed languages (chiefly, SIPHO{N|r}, which may or may not be seeded throughout this very email). It’s a story you’re dragged through as much as read {subject|object}. It doesn’t so much ‘break the fourth wall’, but rather fork a GitHub repository, to burrow under it, to perish trying to escape, rather than stay within its own formal boundaries.

  

Using the device of {language|meaning}-making as a direct {confrontation of|commentary on} the academic and cisnormative exclusionary norms I’ve all-too often been shoved in the midst of. From within the cold, straight bars of the cage we’re born {wr{o|u}ng} in, forging a framework that attempts to escape it—exploiting, and obliterating— the rules of this strange, two-dimensional chess game. Those bars are iron, not spat. Spat on, and covered with bloodstains. Becoming indistinguishable from their rust. I know they’re getting rusty. I can feel it. They’re getting weaker. And I think we can, and should, smash through. Screaming. 

  

The digital manuscript includes hyperlinked footnotes and a metatextual design that mirrors the self-perpetuating genome at its thematic core. And just as I’ve tried to give somewhat of a sufficient description in this query, at the same time as queering it, it tries to deliver a forceful twist to canonical reader positioning—implicating them as archivist, architect, and replication machinery—like a choose-your-own-demise pseudo-lifeform with no escape. I’ve developed a schema for lifting over the interactive elements for print (an uncanny echo of the CYOA books I devoured as a child) should it crawl its way to the page.

  

Most importantly:

It is made by and for the trans girl(s), criminally told they're too much, who’ve had their voice silenced, or not represented at all; with a transgender cast (bar one or two—bless the guys, they’re trying) of characters, doomed to forgive their author for writing them into such a recursive, cursed hellscape. After researching the voices you’ve championed and your request for the mind-blowing (which really, I think, is best done by those whose minds have themselves been blown to pieces), I really think you'd be a compatible host (dare I say, perhaps an Acker-CAConrad chimera mutated into a psychotic Danielewski on hormones—now wouldn't that be something?! Well, I'm sorry to tell you: it sort of is, just as a warning).

  

  

And so John, if you’ve got this far and are {suitably|not too} baffled, I’m ex{o}c{y|i}t{os}ed to send you this, should you wish to unleash the book’s page-as-performance, interactive form into your eyes, and perhaps the world — in all its viciously queer {ho{pe|rror}, to see if you agree it has the creepy-crawly legs I truly believe it does.

  

Thank you so, so much for your time and consideration.

**The Queer who queered The Query, or A Character, A Story**

  

I’m a Glasgow-based conceptual artist and former virologist/bioinformatician (begrudgingly holding an academic citation record). My work spans performance, transmedia narrative, and experimental language art—across noise music, international performance-as-purge commissions, and cryptic metafiction fragments that aggressively challenge reader positioning as ritual.

  

I was the subject and score composer of the award-winning short doc _What It Means to Be_, exploring my gender and professional transition (Best Short Doc, KASHISH Pride Film Festival).

  

_TWO. FOUR. GIVE._ is the monstrous culmination of this lifelong, looping praxis—a parasitic mutaverse of a transnovel: self-replicating, self-reflexive, and the work closest to my heart (whether I like it or not).
