First Buckle's Buck Kit, 
Then Blank Kit from StickÂ 
Then the Rustling Bumpkins made a Bindle Kit

Moved Away From Home To The Big City Borough 

The Kits and their wits Are Amidst A Great Hustle!
A tussle! A puzzle! A buckling bustle!


[[Should He Run For The Bus As It Stutters and Stops?]]

*(Then Through Nettles and Pebbles! 
Stashed On Streets Paved With Doubt!)*
