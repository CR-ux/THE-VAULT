to answer your question. My love. i brought my rape. i am terrified to say it, but my psychosis has been based around the fear or idea or knowing, that my rapist instilled in me; during the event, he said there was a djinn in my wardrobe, watching, tethered to him -- i performed rituals to untether the djinn; andi think i helped him more than anyone has, but i wonder, if the djinn, is KSHÆ'L, is the infernal name of my personal unspoken god, is what has caused this grief, bereavement, assault, which came like a [[F IS FOR FULMINANCY|Fulminancy]], like lightning into my life seemingly inexplicably, everything crumbling like babel, everything dissolving into the self same components fo language -- seeming to give me all these siddhis, which I have tried to [[Cultivate]] through these thirty one years of back breaking creative work and strife and scientific research and endless rabbit holes in my bedroom alone -- they all came to me; in ways that are incomprehensible to any mortal. i wonder if the djinn is tethered to me now; and as in my novel concept , take up reæl, where the artist is slowly and suddenly overtaken by their art, until they are unravelled and no more, and the art continues on to the next , a parasite, i wonder, if i brought it into reality, by allowing my rapist a sense of respite from his clear schizophrenia, which of course, is just what we call in the west what they call in the east and indigenous cultures --shamanism.
