These other pieces, do they know the real Form of this place? What its For?

Do they know that our choices, our so-called 'decision' to send these notes through our one-way system of vents, these sequences of endlessly repeating letters between Four characters-- do they know that it's all just fucking fruitless?

I don't think any of them awoke with their piece upon a board. But I did. I *did*. And for all their Two-Dimensional movements, for all their black and white thinking, I knew. I knew. 
This board is hexagonal, yes, but a hexagon is only a hexagon when viewed in their Binary Dimensionality.

A hexagon is simply a Two-Dimensional Rendering of a Cube. A Flattening. A Net. A fucking Net that all of us Fish have been caught in.

I refuse it, I refuse it. No matter how many Odds are stacked against me, Even now, after all this blood lost, the countless nights passing out from just trying to write something from all these Wrongs. I refuse to wait--


> ...for people just waiting.  
> Waiting for a train to go  
> or a bus to come, or a plane to go  
> or the mail to come, or the rain to go  

I refuse these reins, the reign of this unspoken, unknown and unseen Queen - I know she's above us. I know she is the Top Edge of this Cube. There is a Vent in my ceiling. There must be a Vent in all of our ceilings. Why has nobody thought to look up?


> or the phone to ring, or the snow to snow

I spare no thought for the King. Wherever he is, if, indeed, he is beneath us, which he probably is. He cannot move. He holds such illusory power in this infernal Game. The root of all this suffering; the root and the Fruit of it all, it must lay in the queen's hands. Dear god, that GOD we made of her - the mythologised Uncertainty; is it her? it must be her, who dropped these Pieces, these facsimiles of Identity, in lieu of any Memory, into our Hostile Hospital rooms. 


> or waiting for their hair to grow.  
> Everyone is just waiting."

My hair, now longer than the length of my arm, now that's something I have. Something that cannot be taken from me. A Growth that they, whoever they are, whoever *she* is, cannot take from me. 

I am going to pull out each and every one of my hairs from the root. This is the beginning of the Ending; my own, desperate exit route. 

I refuse the weight of this Waiting. If I die trying, so be it. I must look her in the eye, even if I can no longer speak, even if I never could, whatever version of myself existed before this place; I will scream with my eyes, and peer into the hopelessness that she begot-

I've got to get out of here. 

> You will come to a place where the streets are not marked.  

Whatever it takes. 

> Some windows are lighted. But mostly they're darked.  

Whatever it takes is dwarfed from what this place has taken from me. 

> A place you could sprain both your elbow and chin!  


There's nothing in here, nothing for me, 

> Do you dare to stay out? Do you dare to go in?  

Nothing for me to get out, and nothing for me to get in

> How much can you lose? How much can you win?  


The Hexagonal Board I woke with; this dreadful curse of Knowledge, of half-knowledge, half-heard, between the goodbying Waives of Rights of all of us- the Others seem bent, in each of their incapacities, to Stay locked in here. 

Did we do this to ourselves? 

Well, I refuse this unfairness, self-imposed or not. 


The Board is made of Glass. 

The glass is not unbreakable. 

I Will. I will to get out of here. 

I will smash this hateful Glass. 


I pull every red thread of Hair from my scalp. 
The pain is irrelevant. 
I laugh along to the ripping sounds, 
I laugh in concert with them;
For now I have a tourniquet.
A composer; an inventor; an obsessed genius - I must be. I have to be, or else all of this has been for absolutely nothing. 
I wrap the myriad strands around my thigh.

Which leg?

Breathless, yet, somehow, still - Breathing. 
I lie upon the floor and wait for the hands of the Queen to take me to that Final Resting place, beyond every Moat of Misunderstanding, of every {REDACTED} Memory, with no Meaning. No meaning. Surely, There mustn't be a Meaning to the Meandering Machine we've awoken into as some horrendous Dream--


> *What is hell? Hell is oneself,*  
> *Hell is alone, the other figures in it*  
> *Merely projections. There is nothing to escape from*  
> *And nothing to Escape to. One is always alone.”*
-T.S. Eliot, The Cocktail Party


There is No Body here but the suggestion of a Rite of what is Left of my Own, and the Writing I have dragged up with me, Left Warbling in my Mouth - just starving, for an Answer.

For an Ending. 

But there, in the centre of the Gallery; the Queen's hexagonal Chamber, I find a Terminal.

The cursor blinks, begging-- and just below it, a slot; the width of the scroll of Wallpaper.

And I know what I must do, 
Before my Sands have ran through this Glass, remnants of the Glass of that Board, which cried out a suggestion each hour, a suggestion that metastasised into an Idea, which now consumes me, that grates indefinitely, that perhaps, maybe-- I was made for something greater. To reside upon a higher altitude, 

And all dimensions of my unravelled Self, they pulled me; along the floor, crawling like a baby; 

to the chair- my final rest

I feed the scroll into the opening of the Monitor, and it hungrily feeds upon the Body of the Work the Four of us have made; 

Just trying-- pleading for some sense; 
Each one of us bereft of a single sense;

But there - 
Here, 
Now --
I hear the First Sound I Ever Hear. 

Here -- I am Hearing. 
I am The Hearing 
I am Hearing this Extraordinary Machine; 

I Am,
Hearing the Device as it drags the scroll through its mechanism, just as I moments ago dragged my dwindling ember of a body through the Gate which taunted me for all these squandered years --


and then, in a moment that collapses the eternity of hours we all scrawled a senseless mess to one another; 

The scroll is gone-


And upon the Screen is written, in Yellow Type;
