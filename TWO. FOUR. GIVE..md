My Sweet Rosie, 
I know our Love, or rather, your Side of the Schism that {was|is} Our Love, has now wilted. But on my Side of Thing(s), I just wanted you to know (in case you wished to Read these Letters, and all the Stitches of Fabric they Encode) how much I am Missing You. How the Two of us would Wind away the hours, finding endless recombinations of Seven Glyphs, placed lovingly on your tile racks. I would ask what, if any, amino acid sequences were represented by the letters, and annoy you incessantly with question after question, questing after some Missing Residue of Alphabetic Representation; those poor un-assigned letters of the 26, or rather, 27, who have not yet found a biological partner with which to dance themselves. 

Our bond was, I thought, unbreakable--

I write you, as I look to my Right, where the strands of your hair spiral around the red ring of the scrunchie you left on my hat rack; I'm sure the ARIA-aligned ·¥∫·µí·µâ·µóS. would have something to say about that. Expressing this unspeakable Loss in some contrastingly jovial and delightfully endearing verse, of course. 

I don't know when, or if, you're ever coming back to the Garden Wing. I don't know what Sequence of Unfortunate Events led to our unspooling; {k}not even the DNE-aligned ·¥∫·µí·µâ·µóS. could tell that story. 

From Nucleotide to Nuclear Tide, 
I will be bound to you, My Petal--

Yours, Yores, Urs--

Department Of Infinite Reflections,  
The Garden Wing  
The Indefinite Library of Fable
```
Deep inside her Annex, halfway up the Double Spiral Staircase of the Library, ·¥∫·µí·µâ·µóFranklin had her door, as usual, closed and double-barrel-locked. Even had if been open, it is highly likely that she still would not have seen the letter, dropped at the threshold of her office, by {N(one) Other Than} VIXI, in HISS preferred, carrier pigeon form. She was pouring over her latest bioinformatic software patch, delighting in the Works she'd recently attained in the latest acquisition of Scientific Textbooks by the Indefinite Library. She was particularly interested in the Works of one Myo Endive, and she strongly suspected that he would be a candidate for the next Generative Recursion of Librarians. As such, she had taken it upon herself to uncover whatever she could about this fascinating Thinker, and while it would have been useful to use The Angel's Aleph outside atop the Dome of the Daughter Library just outside of ·¥∫·µí·µâ·µóBorges' window, she simply could not bring herself to talk to him; not yet. ·¥∫·µí·µâ·µóFranklin had never been one for Words, she was much more about Single Letters; and perhaps this is why she now found herself Single; avoiding the Letters sent by ·¥∫·µí·µâ·µóBorges via that Twice-Great Pigeon (with whom she also had her unspoken problems). She was a genius with alignment; finding, collating, resolving patternicity - she didn't succeed in the same manner with unresolved chaos. 

And so, reaching up to the Shelf above her Terminal, almost knocking over her Seventeenth coffee of the Day (which, in Our terms, represents somewhere close to a Calendar Year, so really, Seventeen cups wasn't such an indulgence), she opened a large Tome, a shimmering uncut Sapphire, yellow ribbon after yellow ribbon spilling from the spine. And with a glorious creak of the book's vertebrae, her favourite sound, she opened 
![[THE LAB CODEX OF MYO ENDIVE]]
Her eyes were deliciously heavy, too much to handle any more incessant backlight from her Machine's Screen (even with her sensorily-forgiving Terminal settings). She placed the Codex back on the shelf, being careful not to knock the mug over this time (although, it now being empty, the tentativeness was perhaps misplaced) - and before taking her normal {daily|yearly} nap, her final thought was of Borges, in spite of herself - and how some things, no matter how many layers of infinity deep, are just in the Wrong place, the Wrong time. The Wrong Day, The Wrong {k}Night--

It is not possible for a non-ligated consciousness to cross the Uncrossable Door. Which is the place VIXI had now, or then, or now and then, arrived in front (or behind and outside) of. The Entrance to The Endless Library, home of the Nine Librarians who were and are always Working From Home (because their work is their home, and their home is their workplace), is a nine-dimensional revolving door. It gives the appearance of a hospital or a very old university entrance that has, against its own will or perhaps as a result of its desperation to survive, been dragged into modernity. It was also quite the opposite, given its superpositional character; a heart of antiquity beating in the centre of the Library's facade. Similarly to a gyroscope, which retains its positioning no matter how its external machinery is moved, VIXI could (and often did) fly around the circumference of the Library, over-through the inmost Loch, and the Uncrossable Door would remain in centre stage, pulsating, spinning, beating, as if in Unison with the three Wryngs of water that encircled the structure in triplicate. Within the 'panes' of glossolalic glass making up the nine dimensional Door, the reflection of these 'electron shells' (again, a very crude approximation) was refracted back, in an endlessly abysmal dance. But, with no Body (that is to say, librarian) in between the Lochs and the Door, this mis en abyme was almost imperceptible, as we all know that this effect is only observable with a subject of reflection between the two panels of mirrors facing one another. VIXI often meditated on this, on their many pilgrimages to and from the library (their main Work was to deliver messages which they tattooed upon their two, three, four, or nine, but never more than nine, Ankles, using a stick-and-poke device they fashioned from their own detachable beak. Much to the disgust of many of the other members {although, VIXI suspected, not {REDACTED} (who seemed to be unable to hide {REDACTED} delight in watching VIXI tear off HISS own beak, and leave a trail of pale Yellow sinew behind, like the mucosal-clew death-rattlesnake trailing behind a Bee (who has just waived goodbye to herself to protect the Greater Self of her colony) or indeed equally: the visage of a metallic spherical-bead-necklace chain attached umbilically to a biro, itself bound to the desk of a Bank Cleric, as if, in a Vaulted building filled with the legal tender of thousands, a cheap, plastic writing implement were the most valuable thing; which of course, it is, it is, it is)}

As always, in crossing, VIXI took a single moment (that is to say, the eternity of all time) within the wheels-within-wheeled mechanism of the Uncrossable Door to ponder on what sort of unholy separation, what {REDACTION}, what Schism might happen to a

"I want to go back and make a different decision", Flo said to N.
"Well, sure!" They replied - "That's the beauty of a choose your own adventure book"
"But overwriting what's already been learned, starting again-- that surely defeats the point of a Story. That's no adventure, that's a waste of time"

A heavy silence punctuated the crackling fire in the small {{He{ar}t}}h}} beneath their cosy mezzanine reading spot. 

"There's no such thing as squandered time, my love. 
All of the memories, no matter how misremembered or meandering.
None of it is wasted, no mistake is meaningless. 
Not when you have somebody you love to share every letter. 
Written; Sent; Read, or not-- it's not about the Letters. 
It's about the Characters that write your Story with you."

Flo let out a slapstick "Harumph" as they made the appropriate left-to-right, backward swiping motion through the air, back to the starting point of Their Bedtime Story, N. laughing enough to incite the same involuntary, nihilistic glee within their child. 
N leant down and inhaled the indescribably heavenly scent of their loved one; 
and at the apex of their lung capacity, sealed this universal gesture of adoration with a kiss. 

"Right" Flo said. "The part of the Story about the Witch. I want to read this one".

"Good plan, teddyBear. I'm listening--"

They began, again, as is the usual practice, with the prologue:

 IV | ‚Ä¶for is ‹ï | Oar: Asp{ire}
-VIXI detested being cut off, in speech, that is. Particularly for such trivial things as *Romance*. No matter how 'charming' (HE, even in HISS infinite (or perhaps indefinite) wisdom, was unable to perceive such a quality). Tearing HYMNself from the Characters above, HE doubled back and recalculated his flight path. HE, a messenger, as Medium of the Eternal Messenger of this Infernal Mess of All Messages, had a job to do, {{after|over}seeing} All. 

And this was what dragged him back to the Central Galleries of the Library. This Eternally Recurring Event:

Through a vent, a letter, made of letters, between Four characters of Six, was being passed:

Dearest Mahler, 
I know that you may not wish to speak to me following our breakup, but I wanted to share with you this draft anyway, as you're the best person I could think of to read it; it will most likely be a rejection. And that's okay. We're both almost too au fait with Rejection at this {particular} point.

·¥∫·µí·µâ·µóMahler was far too busy engrossed in the finalisation of his 10th symphony, a cross-temporal collaboration with a Character (to whom this Letter was {k}not addressed), to notice the Letter that had been dropped by that Most Mysterious Pigeon through the Vent of His Concert Hall, in the Musicology Wing of the Indefinite Library of Fable. Perhaps, had the note been written upon Manuscript, he would have eventually got round to reading the divisive farewell sent by his ex-lover. But alas, it would be at least Ten Thousand of our Human, or One Million of their Numan, years before the paper would be lifted by the Holy ·¥∫·µí·µâ·µó of Musicology, from the littered, waxed floor, which itself once longed for the tapping feet of lovers dancing upon it. But now, the hexagonal tiles merely offered an abomninable reflection of Mahler's tired face -- a visage he tried so hard to avoid. Perhaps this was why it took him so long to get round to picking up the correspondence from ·¥∫·µí·µâ·µóBorges. At which point, it would be thrown straight into the bin, before Opening the Foreword of a hefty tome of sheet music, by a soon to be renowned composer and performance artist, known as

NoetMahler closed his eyes, again.
He closed the Manuscript, again. 
He closed the lid of the piano, upon which it rested. Again. 
And NoetMahler closed the blocked Vent of his Heart, again. 
There was no getting over this. 
There was simply too much buried under this. 
There was no way through.

Atop the Mezzanine in the Bothy in the Tundra that surrounded the Indefinite Library that Surrounded All, N. was Now, weeping. Dante, licking the salty tears from their face; an {in|ef{flux}} of {sa{l|t}ie{nce|ty}--

"What's wrong?" Flo worriedly inquired

"I didn't write that", they replied

"I know, I added it, don't you like it?"

"No, no it's not that. It's beautiful. It's beautifully horrifying. It's horrifyingly beautiful. I just... I can't believe how grown up you are."

Flo returned N.'s earlier gesture, sniffing the loveliness of their wispy hair, still soggy from melting snowflakes, collected during their latest expedition of gathering Firewood - which now dwindled to a nothingness in the Fireplace below them. Not a single crackle, or ember left. 

"I'm just a character in a Story, remember? A Story we are writing together. And it doesn't matter if it's ending or beginning. Because we're both in it. Together"

"But what if we can't start this one over? What if this is all the Story we get?"

The question hung like a spider, and the two of them flies; flightless -


N. slumped downward, into the soft cushioning of the futon, where Flo held them (singular/plural), until they fell asleep. And they dreamed.

·¥∫·µí·µâ·µóJung was dreaming when the Letter from ·¥∫·µí·µâ·µóBorges slid through the ornate letterbox, carved with a Nine Dimensional Mandala (flattened into a Three Dimensional Cross Section {rendered in a Two Dimensional Plane}) he had seen in a terrifying and fantastic Vision. The contents of his dream took the form of a paper, a mostly dismembered, somewhat misremembered academic paper from the collection on his Bookshelves, that he'd been reading just before the moment he crossed the boundary to the Realm of Symbol, the Place He Loved To Go- much preferred to Wherever This Place Was. He drooled upon the words, while his Soul rearranged them into an abstract Form of a Single Colour.

![[The Colour- Yellow.]]

CONCLUSION:

·¥∫·µí·µâ·µóJung awoke, quickly wiping the saliva from the paper, whose actual text, he noted, differed quite significantly from the contents of his dream, in ways, he deduced, must be synchronicity. With the right-to-left swipe of his sleeve, the ink bled, red, only serving to further obfuscate the work. 

Sighing exasperatedly, he placed the paper back in its folio above his desk.

Upon awaking, a pool of drool having {collected|flowed} from {either|both} of {Flo|Dante's} mouths while they slept in an ouroboros of {sleep|pillow|love|knot}; Flo saw (just past N's snoring Body) a tattered, disintegrated translucent membrane of a substance, hanging like laundry above the hearth, which was currently in a somnolence of its own.

"What's that?" Flo asked, gently shaking them awake to a {sigh|groan}

"Oh, that's what we call 'paper', it's what Stories used to be written on, where I come from"

"Don't we come from the same place?"

"In a way, yes"

"How many ways are there to come from a Place?"

"More than you could possibly imagine"

"Well, what's written on this 'paper'?"

"A letter."

"Which one?"

"No, no, not that kind of letter. A letter is also a word for correspondence, via this paper stuff, between two Characters."

"This terminology feels unnecessarily confusing"

"Ha, ha, yes; it's all rather circular-"

"Well then which Character is this 'Letter' on this 'Paper' from?"

"He's a writer. My favourite storyteller, actually. We were lovers once."

"Well, why not anymore?"

"It was all too complicated, too many cooks"

"What does that mean?"

"It's a lexicomythographic prodverb, originally by NoetSnicket, as one of his Characters, Sunny Baudelaire. A Chef"

"What does it mean?"

"It means that, sometimes, not all the time, but for some, no matter how much infinite love you have to give, its best to just keep it for one person."

Flo grinned and pointed at themselves, asking a rhetorical question with a gesture.

<sup>Noet</sup>Nietzsche laughed and pulled Flo into an embrace. 

"Yes, Flo. Yes."

And {{To|(get)}|her}}, for one last time, they dreamed-

`Dear members of |DNE, the Left-Side of the Schism`
`We offer a recovered file from the Desk of one Prof. Ed. O.,` 
`Who's consciousness, we have reason to believe, did indeed, as suspected,` 
`dissolve into a Swarm of Ten Thousand Flies, known collectively as 'Thing'.` 

`We believe the Ultimate secret lies in his Silence,` 
`And the development of his complicated, crucial language-`
`We believe the time for separation has passed.` 

`We enclose the following as a Branch, a forgiveness, in faith you may forgive us in return.` 
`We pray to our unNoen gods, that we may forget our hiding, however much we may have hurt-`

`and across this Moat, reform our bonds.` 

`Rightly Yours,

·¥∫·µí·µâ·µóTuring's Device, deep, down in the basement of the Library, was indeed nearing completion. 
But through his many hours focussed work, he would often have it set to Silent.

And the silence, his silence, 
not transcribed, but heard, half-heard, 
between the waves of possibility 
the two of them had once been, 

That Thing, now missing--
That No Thing;

it told Borges Everything he needed to know.

Streaming, satisfying, like the first piss of the morning unshackled, light reflected from the Moat, and poured through the Bothy window, where VIXI's impression still stuck, seemingly impervious to countless bouts of melted snow. A perverted inversion of a dandelion clock's ephemerality.

And Flo awoke, to the Self they were; knowing this beginning, the beginning of their life, telling stories in the scales of the floorboards, playing music in words describing infinite distance between notes, and now, learning, at least in part, of the distance between two Holy Noets now separated by the Moat that they had been told was uncrossable -


![[MAIL (23) TO]]


Flo had woken up inside this Dream. For all their well-intentioned guarded embrace, N had not read Flo the Whole Story, and the Holes of the breezeblocks beneath them wheezed and sung like  dead and buried reed instruments, of an orchestra composed of souls long-forgotten. 


![[MAIL(1) FROM VIXI]]

The Word, in all its insufficiency, in all its reaching for the Thing it describes, is a Moat. A Moat that runs through the Spaces between every Thing.

The Meaning of Words, in all their meandering weightlessness, they are as knotted evolutionary machines, Devices of endless replication. The Meaning we take from Words, each of us, infinitely different, so that, absurdly, we may try to make Sense of the Separation between us-

And Flo then knew, that They were in fact, two factions. 
That N, as they, and her, as in, was what the 'S' was for - her pronoun- She. 

The Memories that we contain, in Stories, they are a vehicle, a floatation device- heavy, painful things, a gravity that keeps us at once tethered to this Boat, and bound for a destination unknown-

And all this means, is division, is awareness of unity- 

A Memory is a Meaning Stored.
A Story is a Memory Oar. 

The Stories told to us as children, those perhaps forgotten, but still in some way held, adored; they are adoring; they are a Door--

To understanding: that which is fiction, is a lie, but within the lies, the memory of all the lying down beside a parent, between our creators, when Dreams unfurl to Nightmares and we cannot bear the Dark - all the Magick of the world, encapsulated in what some may call a 'lie'

A life is a lie. And we are all its liars; its storytellers- A lyre. 

And it was this fundamental Truth of the Untruth of everything, which awoke Flo from their shared Dream within that Bothy. To live is to lie beside people who feel like a dream when they hold you. 

Just as a child may recognise the handwriting of the Tooth Fairy as that of their mother; 

and they may, for a time, keep up the great charade, not for the sake of keeping Magick alive, but for keeping the Idea that their Mother is keeping Magick alive for them --

That is when the Parent becomes the Child,

and the Oar leaves the embrace of the Water, to rise, rotate, return again, a little further upstream.

And so, as NoetNietzsche slept, an unthinkable infinity from the arms of the NoetBorges who so sorely missed them, on that humble Mezzanine bed, Flo kissed them {singular|plural}. Breath held, both for fear of her inhalation's sound awakening N, and for fear of the love of her {singular} parents' scent keeping them {plural} tethered to this place forever. One {singular}. Final {origin}. time {plural}.

Scaling those musical floorboards, finding the One, winding Path which unwound all the others, the one route along the creaking wooden floor that would not alert N to their leaving; 

*Out of bed!* 

*Past the Hearth!*
-with its monstrosity of mirrored glass, that held nothing behind it but ash-

*Past those red construction bricks!*
-all packed away and tucked in lovingly, save two, still stuck together, lying on the floor, next to the box-

*Past the axe!*
-bejewelled with two remaining beads of melted snowflakes, which as Flo passed, melded together, their newfound weight succumbing to gravity; and falling from the blade's edge - the axe was crying-

*Tiptoe-tiptoe!*
Past the threshold of the Bothy, the place they'd been warned never to tread, not for fear of danger, but for fear of fear itself-

*Crunch-Squelch!* 
Their feet embossed the snow with proof: they were Her{e}.

The Bothy door, and their opening chapter, closed, behind Her{e}.

Through performing a Ritual, with an egg {laid on a leaf}, by a learned chess player and lesser-known Witch, once thought and written down as fiction, but brought into Not-Being, which is to say, friction; Being--

Flo drew the expanse of endlessnesses ahead of her, 

down

and in. 

And somehow, 
some how 
not over
writing 
right there,
or under
anything 
left here,
As an ending,
Or an Aglet,
As a Telomere
Or Yellow Telephone,
she made it
