> *It is, surely, absurd to expect to feel normal, and make sense: I am an amalgamation of fervent cells existing despite all odds; I am the cascading chemical miracle of eating, and surviving; I am not designed to “feel normal”; am not designed, at all; I am experiencing consciousness as provided by wet tangles of electrical pulses; my god, none of this makes sense. It is a blessing, even to feel*

# Why B is for 'Both'

Hear, lay our Ædrian.

On The Twenty Third Day, 
Of The Twelfth Month, 
Of Twenty Twenty Three 

They {singular|plural} were inside a Bibliogorætian Bothy, a small shack of infinitely strong, anciently fragile wood, being licked by the Yellow Labrador {metaphorical|literal} of the winter cold. The Bothy was standard, as all the others, spaced out across the Tundra just beyond the Moat surrounding the Endless Library of Labels throughout dimensions unknowable to give the collective appearance, or Simulcra, of each individual Bothy, or Simulcrum, being entirely alone in the Forested dark.

Or at least, this is what they {plural|singular} had envisaged.

Beneath the Three of them {singular} promised the rich, dense mulch of years upon years across every recorded syllable of time recorded in rot, and the woodlouse scratchings of human bone; where even in the depths of silence, still crawled the perspicacious pitter-patter of infinitely intelligent, industrious insects, who themselves crawled lusciously, illustriously, with the Pater-pitta of microscopic microbes - themselves filled with the crumbling chickpeas of the {apparently, or so they thought} thoughtless, instinct-cycle bound, building blocks of all existence. They wound genetic material like wool around the spools of pools of proteins, Histones, making stories from four letters {just four letters, A, T, C, G} forming words now untranslatable in their meaning, but embedded impossibly and inextricably into the ever-eroding, yet entirely solid geoformation of collective meaning, like infinite swords in His Stone walled library. These memories, their self-attributed meanings, forming a peculiar song with a infinite microtones, misattributed by many as falling into the genre of "Noise music" {whatever that means}.These infinite microtones, themselves infinitely divisible and, inexplicably, without defining boundaries between them, when Heard from macro-, or identically {but oppositely}, microcosmic Ear, can be herded as a Single Tone. Histone. 


Above what was Beneath the Three of them {plural}, like a rolled out futon for a surprise guest; perhaps a dearly beloved friend who's infinitely smiling Light you often find yourself carried into daydreams about, whose grave you didn't manage to make the groups memorial visit to, on the anniversary of their death, due to your jaw being surgically bolted shut, and your face swollen Yellow into the facade of a desert; but still below them, lay the foundation of their story. Breeze blocks {which allowed that great Family dog of the Wind {to howl through and huff and puff without blowing the Bothy down|eventually, to crawl within, to die there, so as not to leave The Burden of its alighted Body's Weight in the Family Home- but rather, to face the Endless Night Alone, All One. One final tail-wag of affection, Elected Solitude as a Sign of Innocent and Selfless Love}} were tessellated neatly, much like the building blocks left unattended by Flow, Ædrian's little one. 

As was customary here, Each parent, upon choosing the name for their child, must first choose a Name of appropriate Resonance, and then flip the name backwards for its recording on all official documents in the Endless Library of Labels. This, as you of course know, and as half of you reading will have been directly affected by, which means the other half reading have been equally, though differently so, led to an interesting distribution of what we came to call or have always called 'sense' and 'antiSense' nomenclature amidst the inhabitants of the Bothies. It also meant that initialisation of Names {though this was never really necessary, as inhabitants very rarely left their own countably infinite back gardens}[^Fork] for the so-called *Sentia* generations was made from right-to-left {or 3'-> 5'} direction, with the final letter of their Name{s} acting as the complement to their *antiSentia* parental {and progenitor} eponyms. 

In typifying fashion, N, a fountain of expression, Meaning-deluged, wordy witchcrafting, had devised a name for their child that had two {perhaps, definitely} dimensional meaning, whether transcribed in the 3'->5', 5'->3', or other modality. Flow Oeb {surname redacted}, or {redacted surname} Beo Wolf, or simply 'Flo', or 'B', unfurled a veritable cast of characters from its unassumingly palindromic Seven letters, or characters. 

Just Under their Bodies {that is, gently pressed by the weight of these Three's formlessnesses, Works of Form, and Form of works} lay the splintering wood of the Bothy floor. Flo {they had seemed to lean more towards this directionality of their name as their system of meaning-making memory self-replicated} had taken to memorising which floorboards creaked and in what mode, devising 'scales' through the different forking paths of the shack, their humble, yet infinitely divisible, home. And so therein began a game between the two {or Three, but mostly just One, as Flow was the only one with enough of a grasp on Gordian Chant Theory} of them, whereby Flow would giggle-ously stop N at the door from the small mezzanine bed they had recently awoken from, and announce something along the lines of 'Phrygian!' or 'Lydian!', watching in glee, as Dante, Flo's Golden Light, a Labrador, watched Flo in turn, licking their joyful face, as N would attempt, at the scale they could, to 'play' the floorboards in the appropriate *Ambitus*[^range] - quite, for N at least, an ambitious task. 

In the enclosure of their little house of wood, in the Woods of what Would and could never be wood-be Trees, one of these mornings {where the now-filled Red pale of water mourned the nightly passing of the Moon, and all the pull She had upon its little offering of water}, Flo was yet unaware of the sloughing off greyness of a day, that laid behind where they were lying-- just past the membrane of the velvet blackout curtain they'd woven as One, the possibilities of their time together stretching out in spirals, as spires like hypodermic needles, scratching into the muscle of the clouds, before them. 

'Dorian!' was today's exclamation, delivered gleefully, from the usual mezzanine pulpit built from Tree Bark, to a different, yet just as sturdy, percussive bark from Dante -

Sometimes, having just returned from the Lean-to, where N perhaps had always been going {to|fro(m)}, where they chopped the wood for their {{Heart}h} daily, oftentimes not for the purposes of producing more kindling, but rather, as a contemplative practice, enthralled and rapt, swaddled by the sound of the axe; against the crack; against the absolutely cracking resonance; amidst all; the all-encompassing trees; as a wave of Sound travels through the air; like an adventurer-- delic{ate|ious}. 

Deliciously {wast|squander}ing all their years; 
searching for a single Book-- which might tran{slate|scribe} all the others.

Allowing them to crumble 
into the slo{ugh|w}ing, 
not-quite-yet-h{e|a}r{e} sound -- 
promised into Being, by that first sound, 
of the axe's {or, equally, the {wood's|Woods'}} *crack*, 
the {k}not-yet-known, but felt, because, not looked for, sound-- 
of the self-same {though, now {divided|halved||halved} again} fractal 
of a once-t{h}ree; 
then: {Log;

{Forever}.

Always, due to both necessity and proximity {ever-near was the Well}, would they bring a Red pale of water back to the cabin, the bucket never losing its golden shine, Dante's stash of water.

But, still--
that redness
remaining a lover's promise of burning, 
early yearning for an urn; 
reminding them, that all they'd built 
could just as soon be silt,
and wilted, kindling--
tilled of red
a
rose 
doomed and drawn
to unkindness, as a refuge
to despise 
its growing
made to hold, 
and yet, be emptied

into hungry mouths, 
or moats;
or bailing out, 
for
rowing, going-

to fall, as water but
in rising fire
of cradling arms

be ash, 
remains. 

The visage of a fire hydrant.
Sitting next to the {uncontain{ed}}|able} element of Fire, within that wrought iron Hearth they gathered around, as if the unassuming, supposedly inanimate vessel's very appearance held dualistic and equally necessary meanings: impending {nourishment | restriction} from threat. 

N. had just finished writing a story for Flow, and besides the one, constant watchful eye they kept open while sleeping, which still, as ever, peered itself {metaphorically} upon the summoning stone-circle of those little bricks, 
the little bricks that brought Flow --his owner --so much joy, 
in tur{{n}ing}, brought this, returning, 
fetched as brittle as a twig: 
the smallest nest, this sacred Family's Dog, 
his own. 

Never wanting to restrict their creativity, N could never place the bricks back in the ever-empty box for bricks {which resembled {un{intentionally}|identically}, the structure of the lean-to} for fear of rearranging some structure of a plan, for a yet-to-be structure, that Flow may have been, {{un}consciously}, in the process of {tak|giv}ing shape, by their fingers' {spidery|shimmering} murmurations. 

At the same time, being, ineffably, a Parent, they were ever-all-too-aware of the potential of a choking hazard, for both their child, and the beloved Familiar which Flo had so competently assumed their own parentage of. The {box|bricks {the{y'}re}|with|in} become a reminder of {dualistic|equally necessary} meanings: impending cognitive {nourishment | restriction} from threat.

By the nature of their apparent difference in Form, the duty of chopping wood, and indeed carrying water {or rather, carrying the carrying of water which was the duty of the Red pale} fell to N. Because of their {plural, Flo and Ædrian's} respective sensory sensitivities {and|or} appetites {respectively} the latter's wood-chopping was never observed directly by the former. 
Never seen, only heard,
was that thunderous, splendiferous 'crack'. 

What N didn't know {or, perhaps, did}, but Flo did {or, rather, didn't} was that the uncanny resemblance of the lean-to and the brick box was not just resemblance of meaning in memory, but, meaningfully, in actuality {whatever that means}. They were one and the same, but only through the act of interaction. This meant with every chop of the axe, and only with the Will of the axe's chopping, were the branches of causality in our, 'real' world, or, within The 'What?' of 'Real' Forms. 

{un{noticed}} but {not taken|granted} by the {One|Two|Three} of them, was the multiplication of the bricks, corresponding exactly to the {dw|kindling} in the lean-to. And, in complementarity, as logs were brought into the lean-to, bricks would disappear-- in equal numbers-- from the box.

With every axe-crack {and only then}, or every brick ligation {and only then}, would the bridge between these two seemingly unconnected objects in temporal space be revealed in phenomenological space. As N. often made their {water|wood} {carrying|chopping} {ex|re}cursions in the death of night {pre- morning floorboard game}, or in the early dawn {pre- morning floorboard game}, the two would never be performing their respective actions simultaneously. Rather, the two {or, as I've said, Three}, would be locked in an inevitable dance of action {*wei*} and 'absence of action' {*wu*} by virtue of forces unknown, but deeply felt, to them {*wu wei*}. As the wind is not seen, but rather the effect it leaves, upon the leaves; as a lost lover is not seen, but rather their effect, in their leaving, is both seen and felt; and the wind, as the lover that it is, moves about, within, and perhaps even outside of the space it occupies, it makes new space of its own, between the leaves, in thE--

*-xcuse me, a pigeon just flew into my window, I had to run to check if she was okay, she left a stain upon the unforgiving glass, a trickery of transparency; I wonder if she was trying to get in, to tell me something; or if she was simply going about her business; I wonder if perhaps the message she was trying to carry is embedded in the cipher of the stain; N.B.: It bears the illustration of a dandelion clock, waiting in anticipation for the Breath of a Parent who is a child-- 

As eye was saying, or rather, as I was writing, or indeed as you were reading and I wasn't writing, as a pigeon had flown through the veil of my story into the world we call 'Real', forcing my head to jolt to the right, and my eyes to read a symbol that was or was not written by the Pigeon's leaving body, whether leaving this world as a result of the impact or simply leaving from my field of view {as I suppose, in a solipsistic sense, these are one and the same}, what was it I was saying? In the silent sense of the word "saying", I mean to say, by writing, and I hope you reader read it as such, but either way, perhaps my writing that you are reading is being "said", in a way, by yourself, through the vessel of my "voice", again, in the silent, creative sense of the word "voice", an attempt to creatively convey the idea that the Word, or one's "voice" has both an immanent and transcendent quality, or character, to it, no matter the character of the character reading the characters written in the form of a letter to the reader. 

-N. was distractedly in the midst of t{he{i|s}r} latest attempt to reproduce the labyrinthine musical sequence {that had, so many times, so effortlessly flown from} Flo {Or, Board game} had assigned as the 'Dorian' path, from her picturesque, attic's eye view, young forever. With each 'incorrect' 'note' they 'played' with the padding of their careful footsteps, Flo would {rather sadistically, like a ray of Sun upon a wanderer in a desert} shriek a high pitched "No!" - it was only today, for some reason, N. had realised the homophonic nature of the words "No" and "Know"; and this realisation seemed to set something into motion, as if the act of negation gave birth to propagation. N. wondered, between steps, between tones even, in the microtonal space of timeless singularity, for an uncountable moment, if perhaps they should include this 'propagation-by-negation' theme in their story for Flo, before another 'No' from above, provided a facsimile of the Divine Voice, as if t{w}o say:
"No, N, 
no more revisions, 
no more additions, 
the balance comes from you 
reading what you have written, 
to your child, 
and together, 
the two of you 
creating 
meaning, 

in an i{n}tera{c}tion. 

This 'Divine Voice' or rather, was and is of course, their own voice, removed from the tethers that kept her seeing the bricks as a suffocation device, or indeed the Pale as a protective shield, or indeed the bricks as a creative tool, or indeed still the Pale as a crucible for nourishment of their bodies. 

So, the greyness of the day passed, as it always must, the Two, soon to be Three, going about their business {or non-business}, until the moment arrived, a single yawn from Flo signalling it was time for The Bedtime Story. 


"Before the trip to the Library" they began, Flo's hypersensitive hearing seeming to emit a sound of its own, an axe-crack of excitement or the sound of two plastic bricks clicking together. "I have another story for you"

Flo performed their usual stimming ritual, clapping but not clapping, rather knocking the bones of their hands together with their fingers outstretched and overextended, forming an X with each impact. Every time N. had the sheer joy {and it really was the sheerest joy they had ever, and would ever, feel} of observing their child's sheer joy in its all-embodied, primal state. Simply expressing, involuntarily, the sentiment "I have been moved to move", or, more movingly: "You have moved me to move".

This *mis en abyme* of movement, beginning with the very seed of Love that had birthed them, through all the burning blocks of wood and all the melted bricks of plastic, was the spark that wrote their {singular} stories {plural}. It was, and is, also the same spark that the very first humans {plural} danced around and hit their own bones {perhaps in the form of instruments constructed of animal bone, perhaps, like Flo, in a beautiful manifestation of the glimmering hope of neurodivergent Being}. 

It was, and is, and always will be, the spark that moves the fingers writing this story, as any other. 
Swollen-jointed and succumbing, perhaps, to a sickness, 
this pain of purging;
this lamentation in libretto. 
The 'limitations' placed 
upon all thinkers, 
of this Library of Libraries. 
These lies,
dressed as fiction;
dressed as bedtime stories; 
a structure of brick, 
of Ore. of all the awe, 
of awful Stories, 
real, unreeled, 
as wheels have spoke, 

and all of them, as oars, surrounded; 

by Moat, 
	around a Moat, 
		around, 
			a Roundness
				of a  Moat. 


Or, 


as The Once One of Nine, ex-Noet Borges, once wrote:

"*Limitation to the art brings liberation to the artist*"

And, as always, His Divine Voice offers a semblance of silent soothing in the noise of pain running through my physical body. The difference between 'disability' and 'ability' is the difference between a Framework and a Cage. It is also three letters "Dis", which is the currently adopted name of the previously-worshipped, perhaps first, God of the Gauls, *Dis*. Later through a transcriptional, translational process called "*interpretatio romana*" Caesar asserted that "All Gauls claimed descent from Dis Pater" - which actually means that the Gauls all claimed to be descendents of a God which *he equated* {likely, in a resonant, though insufficient comparison} with the Roman Dis Pater. 

History is not only written by the victors, it is written by the Meaning that the victors ascribed to the Memories of their victories {the memories themselves unreliable, self-mutating machines of meaning-making}, and, more importantly, perhaps most importantly, history is written by the Meaning that the victors ascribe to the Memory of the those they have been "victorious" against. This likely explains, in his incessant thirst for dominance, why the 'Father' God of fertility, the Earth's natural abundance, which he saw as a request for its own dendritic epilation, ripping out trees {like hairs from a leg attached to a body | attached to oppressive standards | expecting romantic company | assumed {whether accurately or not} to themselves expect to uncover a smoothness of skin under the roughness of its veil}, and in the emptinesses left behind, paving with long, straight roads, laid with cement like moisturiser cream upon the absent echoes of hair follicles too soon; bound to cause a breakout eventually.

But moving forward, back to the Bothy, where N was being moved, by the movement Flo was moved into, by N's own metaphorical movement, to a promised point in time that held a new narrative movement still - 

Still, N. inhaled, and the projection of the document onto the ceiling just above the mezzanine bed faded into being, through the movement of not their form, but the movement of t{he{i}}r Will, which as we know is the only real movement there is. Flo shrieked again, this time at a lower register {only they would be able to accurately state which pitch or perhaps mode this note fell within, which is to say, they wouldn't be able to, because they had a depth of understanding far beyond what I could possibly tran{s|literate|scribe|late|pose} onto this Two dimensional box of word-bricks you are currently reading; but they likely would have answered something that suggested every pitch contains all the others}. 

They flopped backward, away from N., but very much so toward them {plural}, toward the story they {singular {plural {triplicate {singular}}}} had written, purely out of Love, and the Will, the crackling Hearth of Will, that was birthed from Love Observed, or rather Love Observing Itself, and the Love of the Will that was birthed from the Infinitely Reflected Observation of Love - 

And Flo was a mirror 
And N. was a mirror looking upon them {plural} as they {singular} ascended the ladder to the mezzanine snug-as-a-bug-in-a-house-made-of-wood-and-warmed-by-the-same-wood-burning-in-a-fire-in-a-box-not-for-restriction-or-protection-but-to-offer-a-little-warm-soft-light-and-sound-in-this-cold-dark-silence, as a mirror 
And, reaching the top of the ascent, an adventurer, ready to read the adventures they had mapped out for their wee bairn in their wee barn in this endless {though crucially, not infinite} expanse of Bothies just like {but crucially, not the same as} theirs, making adventurers of them {plural} both {singular}, they used one of {which one is not important, but it's important I mention its unimportance} their hands to 'swipe' the display of the document, which they had designed to appear as what The Librarians might call a 'book' to its initial page; enshrouding them both in that timeless, unutterable feeling, that seemed to whisper, silently, inquiring, gently out of genuine concern, as a Mother, of all Mothers, to the child, of the child of us: 
	*"are you sitting comfortably?" -*

And the roll-out futon was a mirror -
And the ceiling was a mirror -
And the two of them, lying next to One Another, were mirrors
And the mirrors were, far from abominable but rather, abysmal, not in its commonly-used, {and therefore} warped sense, but in its lesser-trodden, ever-downtrodden shadow sense; by which I mean its realest sense, in that, it points to where the Truth of Light can be found: abysmal, as in, boundless. Abysmal, as in, bottomlessness. Abysmal, as in, the ocean of all potential, which holds the privilege of an amnesty from Gravity as we know it, which it begets to us with each of our own submerging in its unknowable womb; where our {One|Two|Three} {and very almost soon to be {Three|Fo{u}r} characters were lying, not sitting, but still, ineffably content, and yes, very comfortably. 

N, I shall begin, 
had unveiled the title of their latest offering of Love, which the ceiling now reflected back and into the parent and beloved of parent and beloved of child beloved by parent, who, in their holding, and holding of the holding of one another, somehow changed, somehow changed their places, and in the permutation, became a Third, or Fo{u}rth, definitely smaller, yet indefinitely, greater Thing. 

They became the memory of that moment, of the beginning of this Story. 
They became the infinitely expanding and breathing meanings that each of them ascribed to the memory of that moment of the beginning of this Story. 
And they became the Story, which, as N. was about to read to Flo, was titled:


*"We Are 
N{Ever}
Going On A Bear Hunt, 
Ever A-"*

-Gained momentum of waiting in anticipation brought to a halt; ripped as the futon out from under them, and replaced with a weightlessness; a pigeon, the pigeon, flies into their bothy window {as {if t{w}o say}|with the crash of} a symbol- interrupting the beginning of the Story, with an ending of its own.

[^Fork]: many thought they never could, some did try, {ᴺB: One of particular Noet}, and never came back, which of course does not mean they wanted to. But the many who never tried assumed {perhaps erroneously} that those who {definitely} crossed the boundary of their back garden were not permitted, allowed, or able to return {to where they'd started, as if for the first time}.

From the Desk of ᴺᵒᵉᵗBorges,  

---  

My Sweet Rosie, 
I know our Love, or rather, your Side of the Schism that {was|is} Our Love, has now wilted. But on my Side of Thing(s), I just wanted you to know (in case you wished to Read these Letters, and all the Stitches of Fabric they Encode) how much I am Missing You. How the Two of us would Wind away the hours, finding endless recombinations of Seven Glyphs, placed lovingly on your tile racks. I would ask what, if any, amino acid sequences were represented by the letters, and annoy you incessantly with question after question, questing after some Missing Residue of Alphabetic Representation; those poor un-assigned letters of the 26, or rather, 27, who have not yet found a biological partner with which to dance themselves. 

Our bond was, I thought, unbreakable--

I write you, as I look to my Right, where the strands of your hair spiral around the red ring of the scrunchie you left on my hat rack; I'm sure the ARIA-aligned ᴺᵒᵉᵗS. would have something to say about that. Expressing this unspeakable Loss in some contrastingly jovial and delightfully endearing verse, of course. 

I don't know when, or if, you're ever coming back to the Garden Wing. I don't know what Sequence of Unfortunate Events led to our unspooling; {k}not even the DNE-aligned ᴺᵒᵉᵗS. could tell that story. 

From Nucleotide to Nuclear Tide, 
I will be bound to you, My Petal--

Yours, Yores, Urs--

The Indefinite Library of Fable
```

Deep inside her Annex, halfway up the Double Spiral Staircase of the Library, ᴺᵒᵉᵗFranklin had her door, as usual, closed and double-barrel-locked. Even had if been open, it is highly likely that she still would not have seen the letter, dropped at the threshold of her office, by {N(one) Other Than} VIXI, in HISS preferred, carrier pigeon form. She was pouring over her latest bioinformatic software patch, delighting in the Works she'd recently attained in the latest acquisition of Scientific Textbooks by the Indefinite Library. She was particularly interested in the Works of one Myo Endive, and she strongly suspected that he would be a candidate for the next Generative Recursion of Librarians. As such, she had taken it upon herself to uncover whatever she could about this fascinating Thinker, and while it would have been useful to use The Angel's Aleph outside atop the Dome of the Daughter Library just outside of ᴺᵒᵉᵗBorges' window, she simply could not bring herself to talk to him; not yet. ᴺᵒᵉᵗFranklin had never been one for Words, she was much more about Single Letters; and perhaps this is why she now found herself Single; avoiding the Letters sent by ᴺᵒᵉᵗBorges via that Twice-Great Pigeon (with whom she also had her unspoken problems). She was a genius with alignment; finding, collating, resolving patternicity - she didn't succeed in the same manner with unresolved chaos. 

And so, reaching up to the Shelf above her Terminal, almost knocking over her Seventeenth coffee of the Day (which, in Our terms, represents somewhere close to a Calendar Year, so really, Seventeen cups wasn't such an indulgence), she opened a large Tome, a shimmering uncut Sapphire, yellow ribbon after yellow ribbon spilling from the spine. And with a glorious creak of the book's vertebrae, her favourite sound, she opened

Her eyes were deliciously heavy, too much to handle any more incessant backlight from her Machine's Screen (even with her sensorily-forgiving Terminal settings). She placed the Codex back on the shelf, being careful not to knock the mug over this time (although, it now being empty, the tentativeness was perhaps misplaced) - and before taking her normal {daily|yearly} nap, her final thought was of Borges, in spite of herself - and how some things, no matter how many layers of infinity deep, are just in the Wrong place, the Wrong time. The Wrong Day, The Wrong {k}Night--

![[The Right Way Forward, Oar - The Æn{i}d;]]

It is not possible for a non-ligated consciousness to cross the Uncrossable Door. Which is the place VIXI had now, or then, or now and then, arrived in front (or behind and outside) of. The Entrance to The Endless Library, home of the Nine Librarians who were and are always Working From Home (because their work is their home, and their home is their workplace), is a nine-dimensional revolving door. It gives the appearance of a hospital or a very old university entrance that has, against its own will or perhaps as a result of its desperation to survive, been dragged into modernity. It was also quite the opposite, given its superpositional character; a heart of antiquity beating in the centre of the Library's facade. Similarly to a gyroscope, which retains its positioning no matter how its external machinery is moved, VIXI could (and often did) fly around the circumference of the Library, over-through the inmost Loch, and the Uncrossable Door would remain in centre stage, pulsating, spinning, beating, as if in Unison with the three Wryngs of water that encircled the structure in triplicate. Within the 'panes' of glossolalic glass making up the nine dimensional Door, the reflection of these 'electron shells' (again, a very crude approximation) was refracted back, in an endlessly abysmal dance. But, with no Body (that is to say, librarian) in between the Lochs and the Door, this mis en abyme was almost imperceptible, as we all know that this effect is only observable with a subject of reflection between the two panels of mirrors facing one another. VIXI often meditated on this, on their many pilgrimages to and from the library (their main Work was to deliver messages which they tattooed upon their two, three, four, or nine, but never more than nine, Ankles, using a stick-and-poke device they fashioned from their own detachable beak. Much to the disgust of many of the other members {although, VIXI suspected, not {REDACTED} (who seemed to be unable to hide {REDACTED} delight in watching VIXI tear off HISS own beak, and leave a trail of pale Yellow sinew behind, like the mucosal-clew death-rattlesnake trailing behind a Bee (who has just waived goodbye to herself to protect the Greater Self of her colony) or indeed equally: the visage of a metallic spherical-bead-necklace chain attached umbilically to a biro, itself bound to the desk of a Bank Cleric, as if, in a Vaulted building filled with the legal tender of thousands, a cheap, plastic writing implement were the most valuable thing; which of course, it is, it is, it is)}

As always, in crossing, VIXI took a single moment (that is to say, the eternity of all time) within the wheels-within-wheeled mechanism of the Uncrossable Door to ponder on what sort of unholy separation, what {REDACTION}, what Schism might happen to a

"I want to go back and make a different decision", Flo said to N.
"Well, sure!" They replied - "That's the beauty of a choose your own adventure book"
"But overwriting what's already been learned, starting again-- that surely defeats the point of a Story. That's no adventure, that's a waste of time"

A heavy silence punctuated the crackling fire in the small {{He{ar}t}}h}} beneath their cosy mezzanine reading spot. 

"There's no such thing as squandered time, my love. 
All of the memories, no matter how misremembered or meandering.
None of it is wasted, no mistake is meaningless. 
Not when you have somebody you love to share every letter. 
Written; Sent; Read, or not-- it's not about the Letters. 
It's about the Characters that write your Story with you."

Flo let out a slapstick "Harumph" as they made the appropriate left-to-right, backward swiping motion through the air, back to the starting point of Their Bedtime Story, N. laughing enough to incite the same involuntary, nihilistic glee within their child. 

N leant down and inhaled the indescribably heavenly scent of their loved one; 
and at the apex of their lung capacity, sealed this universal gesture of adoration with a kiss. 

"Right" Flo said. "The part of the Story about the Witch. I want to read this one".

"Good plan, teddyBear. I'm listening--"

They began, again, as is the usual practice, with the prologue:

ᴺᵒᵉᵗMahler was far too busy engrossed in the finalisation of his 10th symphony, a cross-temporal collaboration with a Character (to whom this Letter was {k}not addressed), to notice the Letter that had been dropped by that Most Mysterious Pigeon through the Vent of His Concert Hall, in the Musicology Wing of the Indefinite Library of Fable. Perhaps, had the note been written upon Manuscript, he would have eventually got round to reading the divisive farewell sent by his ex-lover. But alas, it would be at least Ten Thousand of our Human, or One Million of their Numan, years before the paper would be lifted by the Holy ᴺᵒᵉᵗ of Musicology, from the littered, waxed floor, which itself once longed for the tapping feet of lovers dancing upon it. But now, the hexagonal tiles merely offered an abomninable reflection of Mahler's tired face -- a visage he tried so hard to avoid. Perhaps this was why it took him so long to get round to picking up the correspondence from ᴺᵒᵉᵗBorges. At which point, it would be thrown straight into the bin, before Opening the Foreword of a hefty tome of sheet music, by a soon to be renowned composer and performance artist, known as

There was simply too much buried under this. 
There was no way through.

"What's wrong?" Flo worriedly inquired

"I didn't write that", they replied

"I know, I added it, don't you like it?"

"No, no it's not that. It's beautiful. It's beautifully horrifying. It's horrifyingly beautiful. I just... I can't believe how grown up you are."

Flo returned N.'s earlier gesture, sniffing the loveliness of their wispy hair, still soggy from melting snowflakes, collected during their latest expedition of gathering Firewood - which now dwindled to a nothingness in the Fireplace below them. Not a single crackle, or ember left. 

"I'm just a character in a Story, remember? A Story we are writing together. And it doesn't matter if it's ending or beginning. Because we're both in it. Together"

"But what if we can't start this one over? What if this is all the Story we get?"

The question hung like a spider, and the two of them flies; flightless -


N. slumped downward, into the soft cushioning of the futon, where Flo held them (singular/plural), until they fell asleep. And they dreamed.

ᴺᵒᵉᵗJung was indeed dreaming when the Letter from ᴺᵒᵉᵗBorges slid through the ornate letterbox, carved with a Nine Dimensional Mandala (flattened into a Three Dimensional Cross Section {rendered in a Two Dimensional Plane}) he had seen in a terrifying and fantastic Vision. The contents of his dream took the form of a paper, a mostly dismembered, somewhat misremembered academic paper from the collection on his Bookshelves, that he'd been reading just before the moment he crossed the boundary to the Realm of Symbol, the Place He Loved To Go- much preferred to Wherever This Place Was. He drooled upon the words, while his Soul rearranged them into an abstract Form of a Single Colour.

CONCLUSION:

ᴺᵒᵉᵗJung awoke, quickly wiping the saliva from the paper, whose actual text, he noted, differed quite significantly from the contents of his dream, in ways, he deduced, must be synchronicity. With the right-to-left swipe of his sleeve, the ink bled, red, only serving to further obfuscate the work. 

Sighing exasperatedly, he placed the paper back in its folio above his desk.

Upon awaking, a pool of drool having {collected|flowed} from {either|both} of {Flo|Dante's} mouths while they slept in an ouroboros of {sleep|pillow|love|knot}; Flo saw (just past N's snoring Body) a tattered, disintegrated translucent membrane of a substance, hanging like laundry above the hearth, which was currently in a somnolence of its own.

"What's that?" Flo asked, gently shaking them awake to a {sigh|groan}

"Oh, that's what we call 'paper', it's what Stories used to be written on, where I come from"

"Don't we come from the same place?"

"In a way, yes"

"How many ways are there to come from a Place?"

"More than you could possibly imagine"

"Well, what's written on this 'paper'?"

"A letter."

"Which one?"

"No, no, not that kind of letter. A letter is also a word for correspondence, via this paper stuff, between two Characters."

"This terminology feels unnecessarily confusing"

"Ha, ha, yes; it's all rather circular-"

"Well then which Character is this 'Letter' on this 'Paper' from?"

"He's a writer. My favourite storyteller, actually. We were lovers once."

"Well, why not anymore?"

"It was all too complicated, too many cooks"

"What does that mean?"

"It's a lexicomythographic prodverb, originally by NoetSnicket, as one of his Characters, Sunny Baudelaire. A Chef"

"What does it mean?"

"It means that, sometimes, not all the time, but for some, no matter how much infinite love you have to give, its best to just keep it for one person."

Flo grinned and pointed at themselves, asking a rhetorical question with a gesture.

CHAPTER XVIII | …for is ܨ | Oar: Lys

Flo awoke, knowing this beginning, the beginning of their life, telling stories in the scales of the floorboards, playing music in words describing infinite distance between notes, and now, learning, at least in part, of the distance between two Holy Noets now separated by the Moat that they had been told was uncrossable -


![[MAIL (23) TO]]


Flo had woken up inside this Dream. For all their well-intentioned guarded embrace, N had not read Flo the Whole Story, and the Holes of the breezeblocks beneath them wheezed and sung like  dead and buried reed instruments, of an orchestra composed of souls long-forgotten. 


![[MAIL(1) FROM VIXI]]

The Word, in all its insufficiency, in all its reaching for the Thing it describes, is a Moat. A Moat that runs through the Spaces between every Thing.

The Meaning of Words, in all their meandering weightlessness, they are as knotted evolutionary machines, Devices of endless replication. The Meaning we take from Words, each of us, infinitely different, so that, absurdly, we may try to make sense of the separation between us-

The Memories that we contain, in Stories, they are a vehicle, a floatation device- heavy, painful things, a gravity that keeps us at once tethered to this Boat, and bound for a destination unknown-

And all this means, is division, is awareness of unity- 

A Memory is a Meaning Stored.
A Story is a Memory Oar. 

The Stories told to us as children, those perhaps forgotten, but still in some way held, adored; they are adoring; they are a Door--

To understanding: that which is fiction, is a lie, but within the lies, the memory of all the lying down beside a parent, between our creators, when Dreams unfurl to Nightmares and we cannot bear the Dark - all the Magick of the world, encapsulated in what some may call a 'lie'

A life is a lie. And we are all its liars; its storytellers- A lyre. 

And it was this fundamental Truth of the Untruth of everything, which awoke Flo from their shared Dream within that Bothy. To live is to lie beside people who feel like a dream when they hold you. 

Just as a child may recognise the handwriting of the Tooth Fairy as that of their mother; 

and they may, for a time, keep up the great charade, not for the sake of keeping Magick alive, but for keeping the Idea that their Mother is keeping Magick alive for them --

That is when the Parent becomes the Child,

and the Oar leaves the embrace of the Water, to rise, rotate, return again, a little further upstream. 

And so, as NoetNietzsche slept, an unthinkable infinity from the arms of the NoetBorges who so sorely missed them, on that humble Mezzanine bed, Flo kissed them. Breath held, both for fear of their inhalation's sound awakening N, and for fear of the love of their parents' scent keeping them tethered to this place forever. One final time.

Scaling those musical floorboards, finding the One, winding Path which unwound all the others, the one route along the creaking wooden floor that would not alert N to their leaving; 

*Out of bed!* 

*Past the Hearth!*
-with its monstrosity of mirrored glass, that held nothing behind it but ash-

*Past those red construction bricks!*
-all packed away and tucked in lovingly, save two, still stuck together, lying on the floor, next to the box-

*Past the axe!*
-bejewelled with two remaining beads of melted snowflakes, which as Flo passed, melded together, their newfound weight succumbing to gravity; and falling from the blade's edge - the axe was crying-

*Tiptoe-tiptoe!*
Past the threshold of the Bothy, the place they'd been warned never to tread, not for fear of danger, but for fear of fear itself-

*Crunch-Squelch!* 
Their feet embossed the snow with proof: they were Here. 

*Click!* 
The Bothy door, and their opening chapter, closed behind them.

*We're going on a Bear Hunt.*

The character of this Story 


*We're going to catch a big one!*
