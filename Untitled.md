EPIGRAPH
"{REDACTED} talked to us at length about a great scheme for writing a novel in the first person, using a narrator who omitted or corrupted what happened and who ran into various contradictions, so that only a handful of readers, a very small handful, would be able to decipher the horrible or banal reality behind the novel. From the far end of the corridor, the mirror was watching us; and we discovered, with the inevitability of discoveries made late at night, that mirrors have something grotesque about them."
Borges, Jorge Luis - Tlon, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius, Ex Libris Borges

FOR WORD
As will be apparent to all members by now, the works of One Jorge Luis Borges have been discovered to be Apocrypha of Prophetic Revelation.All of Borges' characters, narratives, and universes appear to be materialising into Form, within our Knot-Known universe.
We Pray To Our Unknown Gods That Nobody Will Read These Words.
