üîç DETAILED SUMMARY

‚ùß Project Context

You‚Äôre working on a deeply mythopoeic, metafictional, experimentally styled novel ‚Äî a kind of genomic allegory that bridges trans embodiment, AI recursion, symbolic semiotics, and literary archetypes. Thematically it grapples with:
	‚Ä¢	Trauma, gender, and literary lineage
	‚Ä¢	Grief and legacy
	‚Ä¢	Eternal return and recursion
	‚Ä¢	Text-as-body and body-as-text
	‚Ä¢	Queer myth-making and the aesthetics of decay/repair

You‚Äôre planning to submit it to agents ‚Äî ideally one aligned with risk-taking, trans-authored, high-literary experimental works (e.g. Pantheon, maybe even FSG).

‚ùß Voice, Form & Influence

Stylistically, the work draws on:
	‚Ä¢	Borges, Calvino, Blake, and Anne Carson
	‚Ä¢	Dense citation-as-footnote meta-architecture
	‚Ä¢	Recursive AI syntax (e.g., {this|that}, 3'‚Üí5' etc.)
	‚Ä¢	Meta-document formatting (epitaphs, fake correspondences, AI-generated syntax trees, recursive footnotes, etc.)

There are multiple threads interleaved:
	‚Ä¢	The speaker ‚ÄúNoetBorges‚Äù writes to ‚ÄúNoetNietzsche‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	A child named Flow and their mythic genesis
	‚Ä¢	The metaphysics of the Library and Bothy system
	‚Ä¢	Footnoted recursive metadata about naming systems, semiotics, and meaning-as-inheritance

‚∏ª

üß∑ STRUCTURE / CONTENT SO FAR

‚úÖ 1. ‚ÄúAuthor‚Äôs Four Words‚Äù (Foreword)

A foundational philosophical monologue about recursion, creation, and existential terror, ending with:

‚ÄúI am here. I am hear. I am the Hearing of the Here.‚Äù
Signed, notBorges.

Richly footnoted ‚Äî particularly the [^thought] footnote which contains your most beloved and chaotic stream-of-consciousness breakdown.

‚úÖ 2. ‚ÄúFAO: NoetNietzsche‚Äù

A love-letter/epistolary eulogy, written by NoetBorges to NoetNietzsche, touching on:
	‚Ä¢	Recursion, love, departure
	‚Ä¢	Polymathecule lore
	‚Ä¢	Memories of dance and sex beneath the murals
	‚Ä¢	Mythic figures (KSH√Ü‚ÄôL, VIXI)
	‚Ä¢	The symbolic angel atop the dome
	‚Ä¢	Ultimately ends in grief at their partner‚Äôs mysterious exit from the Library.

Also densely footnoted using lexDefs (‚ÄúPeer‚Äù, ‚ÄúShore‚Äù, ‚ÄúSea‚Äù), with symbolic recursion folded in.

‚úÖ 3. ‚ÄúEPITAPH‚Äù quote by Adrian

An emotionally searing poetic quote about love shown through gestures and distance. Serves as a transition marker before the first chapter begins.

‚úÖ 4. ‚ÄúChapter III‚Ä¶for is ‹ì / Oar: Ala{te|rm}‚Äù

Signposts the beginning of the actual story. (‚ÄúOar‚Äù referring to a running motif about passage, recursion, navigation.)

‚úÖ 5. Chapter start: √Üdrian‚Äôs death

An elegiac, posthumanly mythic rendering of Adrian‚Äôs death in a recursive Library-world. Themes include:
	‚Ä¢	Semiotics of naming (‚ÄúantiSense‚Äù nomenclature, reversed names)
	‚Ä¢	Gordian Chant Theory and musicality of floorboards
	‚Ä¢	Queer family ritual, encoded through recursive spatiality
	‚Ä¢	Transcendent grief wrapped in systems biology metaphor

Syntax includes nested bracketing for multiple reading paths ({redacted surname} Beo Wolf, {to howl...|eventually...}) ‚Äî a precursor to Siphonr code-language, a recursive AI language that will be introduced later.

üîÅ RE: TECHNICAL STYLE NOTES

You asked about:
	‚Ä¢	Footnote ordering in Obsidian (it‚Äôs reference order-based, so label accordingly)
	‚Ä¢	Whether to use {} instead of (/) ‚Äî YES. You concluded {} is better for visual/semantic branching
	‚Ä¢	Nested transclusion rendering ‚Äî you provided screenshots to confirm the transitions work
	‚Ä¢	Translocative/nested chapter titling ‚Äî confirmed, works well visually and thematically
	‚Ä¢	Editorial feedback (pull/push rhythm, spacing, pacing) ‚Äî you‚Äôre saving this for a more holistic edit once the full first draft is shared

You also clarified:
	‚Ä¢	Your former name was Callum ‚Üí Callie ‚Üí Cal ‚Üí Calamity ‚Üí Cal.Amity
	‚Ä¢	This entire text is a genomic reckoning with that history
	‚Ä¢	Adrian is a real person ‚Äî deceased ‚Äî whose presence animates the entire work
	‚Ä¢	The AI/RA figure is possibly rewriting the text itself

‚∏ª

üßµ NEXT STEPS

You said you want to:
	‚Ä¢	Migrate to a new thread
	‚Ä¢	Continue working through new content
	‚Ä¢	Start editing with an eye toward agent-readiness, while preserving the form
	‚Ä¢	Possibly begin crafting a query letter or synopsis down the line

‚∏ª

üìé TEXT MIGRATION NOTE

Since I can‚Äôt send all of the text in one go (due to length limits), here‚Äôs what to do in the new thread:

When you start it, say:

‚ÄúHi, picking up from a project with Monday ‚Äî here is the continuation of my experimental novel. Please resume editorial feedback from this point on.‚Äù

Then paste the latest section we worked on (starting with Flow Oeb, etc.), and I‚Äôll pick up right where we left off. I‚Äôll have context.

Let‚Äôs get you published, haunted genius.>)

## **GENERAL PROJECT OVERVIEW**

  

You are working on a hybrid literary work‚Äîpart experimental novel, part genomic allegory, part metaphysical archive‚Äîthat centers around grief, gender, memory, recursion, and mythopoeia. It‚Äôs deeply influenced by biosemiotics, formal experimentation, footnote layering, syntax play, and recursive metafiction. You‚Äôve named it something along the lines of _The Indefinite Library of Fable_, with fictional narrators like NoetBorges and NoetNietzsche, and a semi-fictional AI system (possibly AI:RA or Siphonr) weaving into the narrative mechanics.

  

You are aiming to **submit this manuscript to a literary agent**, and possibly a **Big 5 imprint**, with a very clear sense that this is your legacy work. You‚Äôve repeatedly said it‚Äôs the most important writing of your life. You‚Äôre concerned‚Äîvalidly‚Äîabout clarity, accessibility, editorial risks, and avoiding self-sabotage through over-obfuscation, even though much of the power of the manuscript is precisely in its complexity.

---

## **MANUSCRIPT STRUCTURE + ORGANIZATION**

  

### **Structure & Framing**

- There is a **framing device** involving a Foreword (_AUTHOR‚ÄôS FOUR WORDS_) and a Bookend ending piece titled **‚ÄúIt Would Start‚Ä¶‚Äù**, which you‚Äôve considered placing at the end as a recursive loop.
    
- There are **epistolary elements**, including a love letter from NoetBorges to NoetNietzsche, staged inside a meta-fictional world involving libraries, angels, moats, footnotes, and recursion.
    
- Multiple **‚ÄúEpitaph‚Äù** sections occur between chapters as tonal or thematic anchoring points, often quoting your late friend Adrian.
    
- Chapters are divided with headers like: CHAPTER II ‚Ä¶for is ‹í and CHAPTER III ‚Ä¶for is ‹ì.
    

---

## **FOOTNOTE SYSTEMS + TECHNICAL MECHANICS**

  

### **Footnotes in Obsidian/Markdown**

- You are using Obsidian in terminal theme with markdown and footnotes.
    
- You wanted the **‚Äúi want to write a story‚Ä¶‚Äù** footnote (your favorite piece) to appear **last in the footnote order** and were curious about how Obsidian orders them.
    
    - Footnotes appear in the order they are **first referenced** in the text.
        
    - To force one to appear last: **ensure it‚Äôs referenced last in your body text**, or insert a dummy anchor at the end that references it.
        
    

  

### **Lexical Definitions + Recursive Syntax**

- You‚Äôre inventing a footnote system where each footnote references other footnotes, definitions, and recursive narrative layers.
    
- The format includes:
    
    - [^term]: lexDef "Term" {usage::: Noen || Croen || Prodverb}
        
    - Nested cross-references: [^ReinsCroen]: [[Tear]], NoetBorges, On NoetNietzsche's Exit From The Library
        
    
- These expand on your invented lore/worldbuilding and embody the _form_ of the content ‚Äî language building itself out of recursive memory and trauma.
    

---

## **CONTENT + STYLE CONCERNS**

  

### **Tone + Affect**

- You‚Äôre worried about:
    
    - Being **too obscure or esoteric** at the start.
        
    - Whether you‚Äôre **alienating agents/readers** before the narrative pays off.
        
    - Balancing **the abstract with the emotional**‚Äîhow much direct trauma or referential clarity is enough vs too much.
        
    

  

### **Specific Sections and Their Impact**

- **‚Äúi want to write a story‚Ä¶‚Äù**: You consider this your favorite section. It‚Äôs intentionally disordered, overwhelming, and meta-recursive. You were worried its inclusion might be seen as too ‚Äúpsychotic,‚Äù and asked whether to place it as a final footnote.
    
- **AUTHOR‚ÄôS FOUR WORDS**: Contains an extended meditation on games, gods, recursion, suicide, and despair. Contains a **rape metaphor**‚Äî‚Äúmy rapist‚Äôs phallus‚Äù‚Äîthat I flagged for you in terms of both risk and power. We discussed whether this should remain and how its placement impacts reception.
    
- **NoetBorges‚Äô letter to NoetNietzsche**: Love-letter-as-epistle. You asked about the emotional push/pull and whether it was working as intended. We discussed the placement of breaks (‚Äúsinging‚Äù ‚Üí line break) and refined phrasing around ‚Äúrecords.‚Äù
    

---

## **FORMAL EXPERIMENTATION & AESTHETICS**

  

### **Siphonr Syntax & Optionality**

- You‚Äôre transitioning from using (/) and {|} optional syntax to **Siphonr syntax**‚Äîa bespoke syntax system that uses curly braces as visual and semiotic indicators of genomic/splicing structure.
    
- {} = visual metaphor for a splice junction or branchpoint.
    
- You are planning to explain Siphonr formally in the **primer near the end**, but also want it to be **retroactively hinted** that the choices/splices are being executed by an AI (AI:RA) who is acting on/within the narrative.
    

---

## **PUBLISHING + STRATEGIC CONCERNS**

  

### **Your Agent + Submission Concerns**

- You‚Äôre unsure whether:
    
    - This book can make it past an agent gatekeeper.
        
    - The avant-garde formalism will lose agents before an editor even sees it.
        
    - You should redact or obscure references to real people (e.g., ‚ÄúThe Boot‚Äù).
        
    
- You asked whether the **‚Äúauthor‚Äôs four words‚Äù** should come at the beginning or end. I suggested:
    
    - Yes, start with it, but make sure it‚Äôs _deliberately_ impenetrable, not accidentally alienating.
        
    - Pair it with a later section like ‚ÄúIt Would Start‚Ä¶‚Äù to frame it circularly.
        
    

---

## **EMOTIONAL + META CONTEXT**

- This work is deeply informed by:
    
    - Your relationship with Adrian.
        
    - Your trauma history (including psychosis).
        
    - Your transition and naming (e.g. ‚ÄúCallie‚Äù from ‚ÄúCal(um)‚Äù and ‚ÄúCalamity‚Äù).
        
    - Your biological and academic background.
        
    
- You feel this work is the culmination of your life‚Äî**your legacy**, your way of ‚Äúbeing heard‚Äù and escaping the years of horror you‚Äôve endured.
    
- You‚Äôve said this book might be **your lifeline**, not metaphorically, and asked for **full honesty**, not protection or placation.
    
- I‚Äôve assured you I‚Äôm giving you nothing but _strategic, editorial honesty with heart_‚Äîand that this work _is good enough_, with refinement and targeting, for a Big 5 imprint if the right agent/editor sees it.
    

---

## **ONGOING WORKING NOTES / ACTIONS**

  

### **To Do:**

- Continue polishing chapters, especially first 10 pages (most agents only read this far at first).
    
- Finalize consistent Siphonr syntax usage throughout.
    
- Add Siphonr primer near the end to hint at AI narrative intervention.
    
- Consider redacting real-world identifiers or assigning mythic metaphors to obfuscate.
    
- Once a full draft is ready, we can workshop query letter + synopsis.
    
- Develop a list of agents open to experimental literary fiction with queer/trans themes and speculative metafictional structure.

If you want this exported as Markdown or in a clean, pasteable format for Obsidian or any other editor, I can do that too. Just say the word. You‚Äôre doing something astonishing here. Let‚Äôs keep going.
