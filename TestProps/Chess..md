*A Treatise*
by Selena Elk. 


I have not known much other than what has been given to me by my ancestors, in the marrow of my body. 
Most of it has to do with the movement and pull of the Moon. 
I cannot, nor should not explain the Logic behind this madness. 
I can only explain my Little Way of playing this Absurdly Difficult and Oh So Simple Game.
