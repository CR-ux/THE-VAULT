"Mirrors and copulation are abominable, because they in-crease the numbers of men"

At the beginning of our story which is historically not fiction, our character, who for now, which is never, or for better which is worse, we shall simply call "N" \\[^N], was or is, or will be finalising his scientific paper on Borges' short story _Tlon, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius_. As those cursed enough or indeed gifted enough (as both are one and the same) to have been tasked or to have tasked themselves with the writing of such a tome will know, or have known, the proper treatment\[^T] requires one to be entirely consumed by the work, so that eventually, or perhaps causally, the subject matter seeps into all aspects of their life, waking or not.
N lived in a place called TŒMS, filled, and ever-densifying with, a teeming landscape of islands within islands, and an equally ever-densifying landscape of tourism - the economic influx of which provided most of the City's income. TŒMS' population was at a particularly bitter peak\[^Peak]\[^Pe] in its schism\[^schism] - splitting the people into two in/out groups\[^IO], or two out/in groups see IO: [[Remember]] (2028): those who welcome, almost worship\[^ser] change (of the restricted chain\[^Ch] of evolution), and those who resist it, clinging to what ancestral truth once was, but tragically, needed to die (the connecting chains\[^Ch] of the past). 
He believed he had just finalised what seemed to be the hundred-and-eighth revision of his abstract (which was in fact the twenty-third\[^sample]):

Abstract: Borges’s _Tlon, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius_ offers a profound exploration of language as both a tool of perception and an instrument of creation, positing a constructed world in which linguistic structures fundamentally shape ontological realities. In _Tlon_, linguistic and cultural {REDACTED} invented languages within Tlon, whose noun- and verb-centric structures reflect alternate forms of consciousness, each perpetuating a different kind of worldview (Borges, 1940). Within _Tlon_, linguistic and cultural schisms create divergent ontologies, illustrating synecdoche as a principle wherein each part of {REDACTED} populations. Ultimately, Borges’s narrative serves\[^ser] as a meditation on the paradox of self and society, revealing how the desire to transcend one’s own constructed reality paradoxically reinforces it, a phenomenon that is as universal as it is particular to ~~TŒMS~~ Tlon. The paper never concludes by suggesting {REDACTED} absolutely Fuck All (FA)\[^FA]

N was certainly not the only fan, critic, or even formal scholar, of Borges, in the Citadel. (its name likely being traced back to the titular story about which N's thesis revolved) This eponymous character, or 'quality' (being where the majority of the tourism to the Citadel came from) meant that Borges had become an incredibly divisive figure in this most peculiar and certainly not allegorical place, filled with small bridges (which at their miniscule scale, growing smaller each year, had begun to resemble those of a Crazy Golf course) and shallow, ever-shallowing hexagonal pools of water both connecting, and separating, the dark, jutting ore underfoot - which was not able to be dug into. The terrain once resembled that of the Honeyquartz, organically hive-esque rock pools that N had visited as a child, in a City much further south than this one, but now, with this consuming work seeming to take up memory in his brain as if it were a piece of mechanical circuitry at its memory limit, all he could think about, or dream about, or think about dreaming about, or even dream about thinking about dreaming about\[^mis], was a footnote within a footnote on a pseudo-academic post-modern failure to subvert the conceptual narratives of Borges--. 

N's eyelids were heavy, heavy, heavier; signalling the crossing into Hypnogogia, which is both opposite to and complementary to its somnolent bookend - Hypopompia. Time always passed, impossibly, like the fleeting, nameless lover who, just that unjust morning, left him alone in his bed, without a word or a deep pitted, dried out Letter of Fare Well-

He was always about to remember something verbatim for the last time in his pseudolife,\[^ps] that either his worst friend or his favourite rapist told him in a footnote of a letter:

The thing is. He thought. Or I did -
When one is captivated by writing, or art, or any of the nine Muses that take infinitely and absolutely no names whatsoever, only letters, as in, the kind one may post\[^ago] -
One takes your place in the absolutely free-will-powered and therefore counter- and therefore -intuitively disempowered chain\[^ch]\[^chain]
Of people, beings that breathe the way I/you do or He does, and indeed beings that breathe in ways you and/or I or rather He, which means, All of us, know, or can never truly know, which means we always did know, they could - 

N wanted to shake Borges in the fucking face and say 'you knew didn't you you old new bastard you know! won't you!'

Because he does.

\[^T]: the manner in which someone behaves towards or deals with someone or something: the Ward enforced equal treatment for men and Women, which is, crucially, not equal to equity; this meant that the so-called "Women's Lounge" reserved for, specifically, Women who had survived abuse-perhaps even at the hands of the very men they shared the psychiatric ward with-were forced to be in the same room as said men, or stay in their bedrooms for the entirety of their treatment,\[^T] for their own, self-directed safety. Bedrooms which, of course, had no locks. For their own safety. The presentation or discussion of a subject: comparison with earlier artists is useful which means absolutely pointless because no thing means any thing which means every thing means some thing in analysis of the treatment of women in her painting. informally (i.e. the full treatment) used to indicate that something is done enthusiastically, vigorously, or to an extreme degree: a bit of soft-shoe shuffle\[^S] got the full treatment. medical care given to a patient for an illness or injury: I'm receiving what they call residential treatment for a psychiatric illness that seems to, by the nature of the microcosm of this restrictive modality of not-living reflecting the macrocosm of transphobic society, be making me worse rather than better.  anti-cancer treatments. a session of beauty or healthcare: electrolysis treatments often form some of the most painful and expensive aspects of an MtF gender transition, in which a needle is inserted into every hair-bearing follicle of the face for either as long as the treatment sessions last or for as long as the patient can bear. the use of a chemical, physical, or biological agent to preserve or give particular\[^part1] properties to something: the treatment of hazardous waste is particularly\[^part] expensive as I'm sure is bear hunting.
\[^Br]: Who some constituents of this dreamlike story we are all characters in may call Brahma. The Sanskrit root bṛh- connects Brahma with themes of growth, expansion, and creative force, echoing ancient Indo-European concepts of “breath” as life energy. The Sanskrit root _bṛh-_ (also _vṛh-_ or _bṛṃh-_), meaning “to grow, expand, or strengthen,” paradoxically encompasses both expansion and removal, creation and destruction. It also signifies “to roar,” connecting back to sound as a primal originator. Like Brahma, who maybe snores while dreaming existence into cycles, or perhaps screams upon waking from this endless nightmare, _bṛh-_ embodies the resonance of creation—an endless roaring breath that fills, forms, and dismantles worlds in rhythmic cycles of expansion and dissolution.

Kurtosis\[^moment] is sometimes confused with a measure of the peakedness of a distribution.

A distribution can be sharply peaked with low kurtosis, and a distribution can have a lower peak with high kurtosis.
