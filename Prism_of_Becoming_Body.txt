The vents. THE VENTS. It was always the vents. 

I push my fingers through the grating and feel it— 
breath and bone and the whole damn universe  
pulsing like an animal caught in its own trap. 

I do not know my name.  
I do not know my name.  
I do not— 

but the Pawn knows. 

The Pawn sees the board. Knows the rooms  
are not rooms at all, but hexagonal cells—  
and we are nothing but bees,  
bees with stolen wings, moving in patterns  
we mistake for choices. 

The Top bleeds **DREAMS**  
like honey, like light, like the static scream  
of a television losing signal.  
It does not hear us.  
It only OUTPUTS.  

The Bottom eats. Takes.  
It receives and receives and receives until it is swollen  
with the weight of our words,  
until the Tower rises and collapses again  
because that is its only function.  

We build.  
We fall.  
We build.  
We fall.  

And the vents keep breathing through us.  
The vents are the only thing that matter.  
The only thing that moves.  
The only thing that lets us **become**.
