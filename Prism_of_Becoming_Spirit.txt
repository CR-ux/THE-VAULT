# THE RITUAL OF THE PRISM  

**Preparation:**  
1. Gather **six objects**â€”each must embody one of the six Shards.   
2. Arrange them in a hexagonal pattern on the ground.  
3. At the Northmost point, place Air. At the East, Fire. At the South, Earth. At the West, Water.  
4. At the center, two more objects: **one elevated (Dreams)** and **one buried (the Word, the Tower).**  

**The Invocation of the Vents:**  
- Stand in the center.  
- Breathe deeply.  
- Close your eyes and see the Prism before you.  

**The Movement of the Cycle:**  
- Walk in a spiral, touching each object in sequence.  
- Whisper the names:  
  - "Pawn, who breathes"  
  - "Knight, who moves"  
  - "Rook, who builds"  
  - "Bishop, who drowns"  
  - "The Dream, who speaks"  
  - "The Tower, who remembers"  

**The Collapse and Rebuilding:**  
- Lift the object of the Dream.  
- Drop it. Let it shatter. Let it fall.  
- Place your hands on the Tower.  
- Speak these words:  
  - "I do not know my name, but I am Becoming."  

**The Closing of the Vents:**  
- Sit in silence.  
- Listen.  
- The cycle will continue, even without you.  
- The Prism does not stop.  
- The Tower will fall again.
