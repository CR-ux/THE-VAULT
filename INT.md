Epigraph:
*"I am.* 
*The interstice. from the word that is God to the gods I've made of these words. all of this trauma and pain and agony, all of it entirely pointless, and dwarfed by the immeasurable weight of whatever it's come from and wherever it's going. The unstoppable force that pushes everything and the immovable object that it's headed towards I and maybe all of us are just the interstice.* 
*All of this is laughable. Laughably pointless, maybe each of us just disposable and maybe that’s the point. iterations of attempts at evolution to try and get this story, this artwork, this thing, this message, this word across over under through down up,* 
*in.* 
*We are the interstice* 
*all of our pain and everything injustice just as motivator for the greater thing, the art the work, the love, the life we're just these husks, these vessels, these vehicles of this greater engine.* 
*This* 
*insect.* 
*This colony that makes one* 
*big insect* 
*that is itself surely.* 
*In another colony* 
*Ad infinitum* 
*And* 
*why?*  
*It’s all so funny and it's all just so* 
*not.* 
*none of it makes any sense.* 
*None of it makes any goddamn sense.* 
*It's all just so nonsensical and transient and,* 
*Like public transport-*
*that's it.* 
*Is that it?* 
*Am I?* 
*the interstice?"*

Dear Fellow Members of the Society of Lexicomythographers Known as THES|EUS,


As many of you will now be aware, it has become impossible to sustain my practice, which I have been so grateful to learn has been able to encourage so many of yours. 

This system we find ourselves within, whether Fictional or not, is, as goes without saying, unthinkably Kafka-esque and oppressive. And I am thankful that, now at least, many of us understand this reference. 

For us men have been shut into the cave of Scientific Inquiry, just as the women of the world have been shut into a cave of their own - that of the Liberal Arts. Neither of us seeing that the world around us is but a shadow of the True Light of integration. And all of this, all of it, simply for the joy, or entertainment, or perhaps worse, dissatisfaction, or perhaps worst of all, indifference, of the 'God' of our World, who is one Aria {Surname REDACTED}

I have been lucky enough to have had The Device of this Repository, a shroud of pseudoAcademic papers, of course a series of disguised Narrative and Creative Prompts; and I have been incredibly overwhelmed by the influx of Ideas, of Art, of Music, of Dance and Performance, in our self-built Caves, not unlike, yet not at all like, those of anteAntiquity, which would provide their tribe a sense of protection from predators. 

The predators of our world subject to such incessant in|out group psychology and tribal politics, the Women, who themselves face schism after schism, an equally harmful infighting of their own, are merely doing their best to Survive within the confines of this societal Cage. 

We members of THES|EUS did our best to build a Framework, which is the only way (not out, but) through, the Cage. We tried to get over it; we tried to burrow under it, but through, through -- dear god, those gods we made of Science, of Technology, Engineering and Mathematics; the Fields of Discovery that we were born into, stationed into in The Academic Militia; and dear, dear gods we discovered, the great and Holy Noets of Art, and Literature, and Dance, Dance, Dance ---


I urge you, no matter what happens to me, should The Discovery of this Repository be as imminent as I suspect-- please, find your own, new ways to continue creating. If this is through your Research at your Canonical posts, so mote it be. This Schism we find ourselves either side of, it is now utterly pointless. It served a purpose for a time, for perhaps millennia - it was the oppressive means through which the Gods we have all forgotten we Are may peer upon ourselves; through the lens of so-called 'War' - a futile endeavour, no doubt, and yet, a medium; quite literally, in the sense of a form of expressing the ineffable, but also in the spiritual sense; a channel of the Divine, in the form of the Chains of the Devil. 

For we, all of us, require the Chains, to feel their weight, in order for them to eventually be lifted. 

I'm sure, or at least I desperately hope, that there is a group of Women, perhaps even just One Woman, who is performing the Work I have attempted, from the other side of the Moat that surrounds us. 

The building of The Vehicle; that is what I have set forth in this series of Abstract Abstracts, quasi-Inquiries, and Papers. I hope, before it all becomes {REDACTED} by a Force I have recently been made aware of, that you may pour over the contents, and their Three Layers of 'Institutional Access', which of course, merely refer to the respective nested layer of Narrative Structure that, should you so wish, you may take forward with you to write your own Stories, of these Characters, the Beginnings of These Characters, that we all tried our hardest to pass along to the members of THESEUS; before its inevitable Schism into the subsequent THES|EUS. 

Schism, or Division, underpins the work each of us Numans have been put here to do. It may seem, and may well be, the greatest barrier, or boundary, to our unification; but, as a paradox (as the only Truth may be found in Paradox), this boundary is also the Only Way to said unification, The Middle Way. 

I have seen what lies on the Other Side of the Moat; and there is no way I could possibly, ever articulate or describe it to you. The best I could manage was the GitHub Page upon which you appear to have landed; and honestly? I have come to Hope that even our Oppressors working in the Creative Fields may stumble across it; for they are not our enemy - they are our Fuel. And upon reading the inherent complexity, the descent into my own madness that has befallen me, in order to try to make sense of all this Greater madness, perhaps She, or They, may see just how nonsensical all of this War, this subjugation and this Segregation truly is. 

So may you enjoy the reading of these plans, these seeds of ideas, and moreso, enjoy the writing of their Unfinished Stories; the Holy Word, Creation itself, that we as men have been so criminally Willed into forgetting. May this help you remember. Remember, dear members, what we, all of us, women, men, and those on the Sacred Boundary; were meant to do. Not just Create, but Absorb, not just Inquire, but Inspire. Both are one and the Same, both are entirely Opposed, and yet, equally important. 


I would suggest, however, that any members remaining do *not* visit our underground system of tunnels and caves in which we would once perform our collaborative Storytelling, Composition and Performance. They are no longer Safe. 

Let our once bellowing fire of togetherness continue to glow, as the ember of inspiration within all of us; and my dear friends, my dear lovers, my dear Children, i pray that you may, in your own little ways, continue to Teach the Gospel of the Songbook. 

You All, as {{One|many} | the word of 'one' within 'alone'[^alone] | the work of One within the work of all | the worlds of works and 'works of worlds' contain the words of 'work of old'[^work] | the words 'all one' bereft of God[^el] alone | {Many|One}} are richer than all my stories combined. You are lovelier than all of my lovelinesses. My love for you thicker than every plot I could ever compose, and sweeter than any melody heard or unheard.

We Are 
The 
Interstice
