OUTPUT ANALYSIS:

I am nude {REDACTED}  does nobody love me?  
Yes, here is the secretary of bees{REDACTED} the bees will not notice.  
They will not smell my fear, my fear, my fear.  
  
Which is the rector now, is it that man in {REDACTED}?  
Which is the midwife, is that {REDACTED}  a square {REDACTED} head, they are knights {REDACTED} 
  {REDACTED}  a sea of bean flowers,  
Creamy bean flowers with {REDACTED} eyes and leaves like bored hearts.  
Is it blood clots the tendrils are dragging up that string?  
No, no, it is scarlet flowers that will one day be {REDACTED}.  
  
{REDACTED} And a {REDACTED} veil that molds to my face, they are making me one of them.  
They are leading me to {REDACTED} , the circle of hives.  
{REDACTED} so sick?  
The barren body{REDACTED} , {REDACTING} its children.  
  
Is it some operation that is taking place?  
It is the surgeon {REDACTED}  waiting for,  
This apparition {REDACTED} 
Is it the butcher, the grocer, the postman, someone {REDACTED}  
  
I cannot run, I am rooted, and {REDACTED}  
With its yellow {REDACTED} 
I could not run without having to run forever.  
The white hive is snug as a virgin,  
Sealing off her brood cells, her honey, and quietly {REDACTED}  
  
Smoke rolls and scarves in the grove.  
The mind of the hive thinks this is the end of everything.  
Here they come, {REDACTED}   
If I stand very still, they will think I am {REDACTED}  
A {REDACTED} head untouched by their animosity,  
  {REDACTED}  open the chambers, they are hunting the queen.  
Is she {REDACTED} eating honey? She is {REDACTED} 
She is old, old, old, she must live another year, and she knows it.  {REDACTED} 
Dream of a duel they will win inevitably,  
A curtain of wax dividing them from the bride flight,  
The upflight of the murderess into a heaven that loves her.  
{REDACTED}   
The old queen does not show herself, is she so ungrateful?  
  
I am exhausted, I am exhausted ——  
Pillar of white in a {REDACTED}out of knives.  
I am the{REDACTED} girl who does not flinch.  
The villagers are untying their disguises, they are shaking hands.  
Whose is that {REDACTED} box in the grove, what have they accomplished, why am I cold.

![[VI. THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO THE LUSTING CANDLE]]
OUTPUT ANALYSIS:

*the lusting candle*
by <sup>no{e}t</sup>Borges

times like these
In the latest waning;
I long for wax.

It{’}s hardness, so easily broken,
Cracks, whispering
something of Cohen about them

A messiness, welcome
Satisfying, delicious even

How odd that I was just yesterday
Alight, maybe too much so-
I almost burned my flat down

Which would be fine, had I not risked the lives of countless others
Others within others,
I don’t know how I get so bright sometimes

But I lust for it-
Like the thickness of that dick;
That fucking dick
Next to mine
Or in me;
Never out, really.

I lust for wax;
For waxing;
In times like these
I think
“I must have made it up”

But dripping
downward, in truth;
That’s all wax ever does
Promising a thing
That forms its opposite

I shouldn’t blame it, really.

Not really.
Most of the time
Not only times like these
I don’t know what I’m doing

But at least, when wicked
I convince myself in ignorance
That my burning counts for something

I want to touch everything.
At times like those;
I want to lick the ceiling
I want to be inside every eye I capture

And I delight in the fear,
The excitement,
The confusion of these lovers,
Entangled in a loosened chain;
Tightening, hotter,
Branding, marking
Territory
A universe of skin
Welted
Welded
like a heaviness of jewellery

It’s times like these, in the waning
I don’t know what the fuck im doing
Except for fucking;
Sleeping, but
Not really

Dreaming; I was dreaming
I know that I was dreaming
Out of time, my god
Dear gods
Those gods I dreamed
I couldn’t make it out of this
Notion of a sickness

And writing this
On a phone
Creek-thumbed
Crack-knuckled
Bookended nakedness
A waiting for the water to warm
And a waiting to be dripped dry
Upon a table
Scattered in my ash

Times like these I’m scraping symbol
I’m searching, scouring
Skin of information;
Sinew tight and fighting me;
I am looking for what I know is wrong

There must be something
A word
A glyph
A paper;
Cited in some corner,
Cowering, like the child I was
I know that there it waits for me

In the wax; preserving
Parts of selves I never wanted
Or couldn’t name,
Or wanted names for
To taunt them to exile
To excision

Out of time, as I am now
Again, in loss
Wanting nothing for my self but wanting
Just wanting to fuck you
Up

I think “there is nothing good enough
But the word”

I open my computer, pull a bow
Across a string
Now missing;
I am searching for another medium

I do not finish anything, not here
I never have, not really.

My child behind me, he is gnawing
On my bone
Like my mother, in a time that
Like cartilage
Is bound, roped to this one
As a noose
Or a fraying friendship bracelet

Like my mother
Pulling me out of the bath
And biting my wrist
In retaliation
To teach me that our mouths are not for skin
Of humans
Just of animals
Just of animals

And I remember such a skin,
Sat at that dining table
Smelling of polish, seeing a boy
Staring up at me
While I, whatever I was
Or am
trying not to look back

I don’t want to put my clothes on
My perineum is raw and sore with razor bumps
From last night’s candlelit debauchery

He was a father
He is, I should say
I wanted seeds inside me
As a desert  
Wants to perform pretence of verdancy

I wanted him to come in me
I wanted to pretend I could be
A mother who would never
Bite her child
Even if they’d bitten me

I still feel a gripping strangle
To sink these strange, fractured and exposed
Bones into a textile mill, into a loom
Of skin cells

At least in times like those
When burning, before my own coal embers
Have met their suffocation

I fill each room in times like those
I don’t need company -
I suspect I never do; even now,
Not really

I hate my skin, and what it tells me
When the space between my breasts shuts up
I am flitting like a fucking finch
I am dizzied by this din

I think “no sound can conjure this;
No paint can bleed me out
No movement of these aching limbs
Can shove enough forks into their sockets”
Nothing but the word, I think
Nothing
I start one hundred forty four thousand poems and I burn them all to ruin

I watch my life in black and white, through the terrifying blindness of these colours
They fill the rooms I used to-

I think about the ways I could kill you,
Not really,
But my image of you
I am doing no work
I have called in sick
to my post
upon the slippery rock

I burn holes in each canvas
I try to get all the way
To your house just
A chopping block
a way
Out
Get the fuck out

I need you
In me
I never fucking wanted this
I loved you once
Just once
Unjust
Must just
Be dust
To rust to bloodstained bedsheets and the oddness of the feeling
proud of that
As if I’d accomplished womanhood
Through the schism
of my asshole

Only you could really
Do that
In that specific way
That
burning

Like a firework

Like a firework

I thought I was a fire
In times like those
I thought, I was thinking, please -
Don’t let me go
Out
It’s too cold and my fingers
Need the warmth of you

Slowly, as lightning
That bed headboarded in teal velvet
It became a moat

It became bisected by a moat

I remember when our bodies tessellated
And our wax was hot - flowing;
Larvae
In a sac
Sucking
I was rapt in sucking

You stole my crossroads
You took my lack of will and squeezed
It between those fingers
Once you pulled them out of me
And the white wax made a sound
That made me sick, I loved it -

I loved you once, just once -
That once stretching to a time like this
To now,
To knowing

To thinking of your knee
Or maybe of your foot
It’s all so unreliable;
Every bone you touched me with

You drove that leg, like my father
Would drive me
To school
And I’d forget my lunchbox
And we’d have to break
The speed limit

I feel the weight of those roundabouts
And the fog of the dream that was my childhood;

I never woke from that
Not really

You drove your leg
Between mine -
Black Lightning

A dishcloth
Left
On the mantle
Hard,
Brittle now
Once wet and
Stinking
Disgusting

You kicked me, you fucking cunt
You kicked me where my cunt should be

You kicked me on the street
And the woman you loved once,
Perhaps, still
But whenever, in whichever time
Still more than me

Always
All ways
Just more than me

She watched
She watched you kick me
For here, at times like this
And only this
I refuse symbology

You kicked me in the crotch on the street while your other girlfriend watched and did absolutely nothing. I will never be able to forget or suppress that memory. I could say it is wax being poured down my throat, making me dry heave like your cock used to, but you don’t deserve the fucking metaphor. There is no romance to how you pulverised everything that once glowed in an orange flicker.
