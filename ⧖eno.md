![[The Egg, Cracked]]


They awoke. Alone.
Here, again, alone.
Knowing. 
No,
Hearing. 
In the microtonal scale they had spent many, many long hours alone, decoding. 
Written, in blood, by some now known hand, onto strange and mysterious vellum.
They were awake now, and they could not go back to sleep-
Covered not in blankets, but in the manuscripts themselves, ⧖eno looked down once more upon the pages they had po{u}red {over|into}, for the majority of their adult life. 

And the glyphs were dancing like ancestral bodies about a fire. 
A pyre. 
And they were speaking to them, in tongues; 
Through the eye that afforded them a certain key-
Through the loch of these centuries of misunderstanding.
Reaching through a funnel of her own making, Hildr was telling ⧖eno the history of a people, erased. 
Hildr's intersex identity, which would lead to her exile;
Branded as a witch, which of course, she was, and alighted to a cave, to scrape this trans-temporal message, to a soul she knew would be the only one to decode it. 
The scale within scales, as a shedding- 

A {portal|door}
A {downpour|mourning}
A {medium|message|lore}

Oar,
A ward, and {dis|b}order
A warden to a swarm.

Or, what's more-
A warning. 

A desperate, final record of the person she'd been, 
And the Being {she|they} would need to become. 
Not burned, but crumpled, 
A {veiling|hiding|cape}--
A shrinking 
to escape.

A spinning thread, 
Of silk, unthinkable
incomprehensible in shape;
They tried to immolate her flesh 
But {k}new {k}not what was at stake-

And when she seemed unbreakable,
(No match would light her fuse);
They upped their {ante|strategy}
And fastened her a noose

And S{o|ew} there,
Below those Branches 
Blanketing their hate
Our wondrous Hildr 
Born of Land, of Sea, of Heaven's Gate
Was then reborn a funnel spider,
To weave another's fate

And through this web, through their eye
From the Yew Tree's nape
time hanging, 
Not hanged, but changed--
Smaller, yes, much smaller, 
But collapsed into such a greater scale-
In a balance of weight;
Came her words, like the greed of a mangle 
Of magnetic tape;
