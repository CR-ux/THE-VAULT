  .
.IVX- | -XVI. (gods) “She has a key worker with her local community mental health team. Last February and April, she was diagnosed with ADHD and autism, respectively.”
  .
.VX- | -XV. (that) “Previously, she was diagnosed as being emotionally unstable. She has never been happy with the diagnosis of borderline personality disorder, as she does not think it explains her presentation.”
  .
.VIX- | -XIV. (somebody) “Lately, the smallest things can set her off emotionally. She does some work that involves burning a hole in the canvas.”
.IIIX- | -XIII. (will) “Some material she used had plastic at the back, and she burned her carpet, almost burning her flat down. She has a complicated history with all of the difficulties attendant on growing up as a trans-female.”
.IIX- | -XII. (read) “She was academically gifted. In school, she studied biology, chemistry, physics, philosophy, and ethics for A-levels. She was going to go to Oxford to study medicine.”

.IIIV- | -VIII. (all) “Aiming for the best, she became a double bass player. She had to sit on a bar stool to reach the neck of the instrument.”
.IIV- | -VII. (their) “She moved onto piano. Music has remained a huge release for her. She writes her own pieces.”
.IV- | -VI. (ten) “She is also a writer and has almost completed a very complicated book. At present, she is working as a software engineer.”
.V- | -V. (thousand) “Most of this is self-taught. Unfortunately, because of her emotional incontinence, she is unable to focus on anything at present.”
.IV- | -IV. (lives) “She has so much that she wants to say but is unable to filter out the important points. Not surprisingly, given her autistic traits, she is bewildered by the noise that she experiences everywhere.”
.III- | -III. (were) “Over the years, she has engaged in self-harm. She has never been sure why she did this. She does not want to die.”

.III | III. (second) “Unfortunately, it does not stop the cyclical emotions. She continues to approach life from a scientific basis but she mourns the fact that science has become exponentially less scientific with every passing year.”
.IV | VI. (dream) “She feels that people have lost awareness of the changes that have occurred over the last two decades. Callie was born and brought up in Coventry. Her mother and father are alive and well.”
