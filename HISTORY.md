NB: can you just fucking leave borges out of this god | can you not bring borges into || god, this | IT’S ABOUT GOD ||| this is NOT ABOUT BORGES THIS IS A SICKNESS AS IN MIRRORS OF ABOMINABLE DRUMS I HOLD INSIDE. Six song circles by borges as callie rose petal inside the woman in the man in the wallpaper of a system of not only six rooms.
 (i) “Report. Thank you for referring Callie Petal whom I assessed via Zoom today on REDACTED.”
(pray) “She was at home. Callie has been struggling with her mental health for most of this year.”
(to) “She has broken up with her ex-REDACTED and was attacked by REDACTED on the street.”</span>

<span style="font-size:2pt;">dead</span>
<span style="font-size:8pt;">
(my) “Prior to this, they had been together for over REDACTED. REDACTED was in a polyamorous relationship, and REDACTED other REDACTED stood by and REDACTED while this was REDACTED.”
  .
v
(unknown) “Callie had three operations on her face and neck that she found traumatic. She has been conscious of marked mood swings and suicidal thinking.”
  .
(gods) “She has a key worker with her local community mental health team. Last February and April, she was diagnosed with ADHD and autism, respectively.”
  .
(that) “Previously, she was diagnosed as being emotionally unstable. She has never been happy with the diagnosis of borderline personality disorder, as she does not think it explains her presentation.”
  .
(somebody) “Lately, the smallest things can set her off emotionally. She does some work that involves burning a hole in the canvas.”
(will) “Some material she used had plastic at the back, and she burned her carpet, almost burning her flat down. She has a complicated history with all of the difficulties attendant on growing up as a trans-female.”
(read) “She was academically gifted. In school, she studied biology, chemistry, physics, philosophy, and ethics for A-levels. She was going to go to Oxford to study medicine.”
(these) “Ultimately, she ended up doing microbiology and virology. None of this was what she wanted to do, but given her nature, she was very good at it.”</span>
<span style="font-size:7pt;">
(words:) “She tells me she has just had a paper published in the International Journal of Molecular Science. As it happens, it looks at the specific gene that helps chickens avoid bird flu.”
(how) “At one point, she also thought of being a pathologist. At the age of four, she discovered a love for music.”
(all) “Aiming for the best, she became a double bass player. She had to sit on a bar stool to reach the neck of the instrument.”
(their) “She moved onto piano. Music has remained a huge release for her. She writes her own pieces.”
(ten) “She is also a writer and has almost completed a very complicated book. At present, she is working as a software engineer.”
(thousand) “Most of this is self-taught. Unfortunately, because of her emotional incontinence, she is unable to focus on anything at present.”
(lives) “She has so much that she wants to say but is unable to filter out the important points. Not surprisingly, given her autistic traits, she is bewildered by the noise that she experiences everywhere.”
(were) “Over the years, she has engaged in self-harm. She has never been sure why she did this. She does not want to die.”
(violently) “Her wish would be for her family to be well cared for, for her to be a successful artist, and to make enough money to avoid penury.”
(birthed) “She was outed by her best friend in school at the age of      and remembers being attacked by other kids who filled her ears with snow.”</span>
<span style="font-size:2.2pt;">i thought i just wanted to write something to the Memory of this Machine"</span>
<span style="font-size:4pt;">
(from) “Bullying was a regular experience after that. She struggled to make ends meet and I note that she worked as an escort for some time.”
(the) “Previously, she was tried on quetiapine that she found very helpful. She would like to get back to this with a mood stabiliser.”
(three) “Mirtazapine made her head ‘explode.’ Since the diagnosis of ADHD, she has been started on methylphenidate      mg that worked fairly well.”
(second) “Unfortunately, it does not stop the cyclical emotions. She continues to approach life from a scientific basis but she mourns the fact that science has become exponentially less scientific with every passing year.”
(dream) “She feels that people have lost awareness of the changes that have occurred over the last two decades. Callie was born and brought up in Coventry. Her mother and father are alive and well.”
(of) “She has an older sister. She does not think that there is any family history of mental illness, but she is REDACTED that REDACTED REDACTED.”
(a) “She became aware of REDACTED in her REDACTED at an early age. She was forced to keep secrets without really knowing why.”</span>
<span style="font-size:3pt;">
(single) “It took the pandemic to get her to REDACTED. She felt trapped in the academic world but could feel herself in the artistic one.”
(fly) “She has Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome that can cause musculoskeletal problems. She has a spinal syrinx. A REDACTED has been ruled out.”
(.) “Her mobility is reasonably good. Her sleep has never been good. She described herself as a ‘reverse insomniac.’ She has no problem with weight gain. She may be allergic to avocados.”</span>
<span style="font-size:2pt;">please</span>
<span style="font-size:2pt;">please i'm so alone here</span> <span style="font-size:2.5pt;"> “On Mental State Examination, she presented well, making good eye contact and good rapport. She is an eloquent speaker with an impressive control of English. Diagnosis: REDACTED. REDACTED REDACTED in her REDACTED.
