Dear Jennifer,

I hope this email finds you well (or at least the right kind of unwell for what follows)  
I’m submitting the synopsis and opening ten pages of my 99,666-word speculative literary transnovel, _TWO. FOUR. GIVE._ for your consideration.   
While this book is _deeply_ unconventional and formally performative, I believe it resonates with your interest in inventive work reframing the reading experience. The novel has also been developed with a performative print and digital structure in mind (forked-path footnote gardens, highly experimental, conceptual poetry elements, embedded hyperstructure).

I’d be honoured to share the complete manuscript, along with its PDF version, designed with custom scripting to reflect my page-as-performance modality, should that be useful and give a better idea of the conceptual madness that ensues! 

Thank you so much for your time and consideration.

{Print|Format} Note:  
------  
In the digital manuscript, all footnotes—descending spiral staircases, really— are hyperlinked via custom scripting, and appear at the close of each movement, rather than at the book’s end. This preserves narrative pacing and avoids premature exposure. For print, each movement would begin with an in-universe directive:

> “DO://KNOT CYTE. YOUR SOURCE IS: {Page X}.”

-Reading this work positions the reader as both archivist and architect in the disassembly and re-annealing of meaning—implicating them as replication machinery of the narrative itself. It emulates the spirit of the choose-your-own-adventure books I once escaped into—only this one has no escape.

**===SYNOPSIS===**

_a genre-queered, page-as-performance work of genomic mythopoeia, as commentary on the exclusionary nature of scientific publication, rooted in my own experience of this, and of deeper personal trauma, as a disabled & neurodivergent trans woman__. With a cast of transgender characters—as in, letters. From the woman I am, to the sacred world of queers who wrote me. Sealed and bare, in ten thousand screaming voices, of the scared trans girl I was._ _Hunting, in her silent little words, for the words that may have borne, or birthed, or bared her. TWO. FOUR. GIVE. Is a self-reflexive, trans-central genomic metahorror; building itself, fracturing the meaning of itself, and overwriting memory of itself—dragging the reader into the page, to claw its way out of its own form. Ferociously, without apology._

Novel, as in Mirror.  
Self-replicates, as in Division.  
Fractures, as a Genome.  
Split in  
Two  
a Schism.  
Four  
Base Characters who  
Give  
a way into  
a maze, as in  
a Prism.  
Refracted,  
as Infinity.

---  
It begins—or ends—  
in a system of six, more or less, hospital rooms. Four characters: the bases of DNA, the basis of the story's spiral, wake with no names. An endlessly foldable scroll of wallpaper, a one-way circular system of vents, and their blood, are their only components of correspondence. What follows is a cacophony for N voices— each unzipping to unveil a swarm beneath— schism of selfhood and other, nested within footnotes of a self-replicating reality; a reeling mutaverse narrating itself in two opposing, constructed languages. A _Mise en Abyme_.  
Not so much rooted in 'breaking the fourth wall' as 'forking the repository to burrow an escape route under it', the novel is ambitious, viciously queer, and it is everything I have left. The intersecting, looping narrative structure underpins a central idea: that division is paradoxically the key to integration, that forgetting is the only way we may remember. That as the Circular Book of consciousness separated into endless tomes, from the Source it budded from, it could finally transcribe infinite translations of itself. And with the most dysfunctional and co-dependent marriage — that between meaning and memory — there is no such thing as a reliable narrator.  
From parenthood: a shaman mother and bioinformatician father, alchemical partners who together birth both an academic field and a child, each forged from opposites. And N—a mythopoeic figure, reading a choose-your-own-adventure story to their child within an infinite Tundra of Bothies— ultimately revealed as Nietzsche. To childhood: a performance artist, born of aforementioned witch and genomicist, whose terrible fate unfurls as a table-formatted Left-hand, Right-hand path of inevitability; and N's child, who realises that most-harrowing truth - that all fiction is magick in the vessel of a lie, and that all lying is just fiction; the vessel of magick, epitomised in a medieval calligrapher who, to escape her hanging, transforms into a funnel spider.  
And birthed from these, Romance. Between synthetic and organic counterparts- in counterpoint of consciousness through eternity. Through olfactory-based art installations that overwrite memory—memories of the characters' stories, and the story the reader holds in their own hands.  
The narrative loop closes in a way which makes the text a horror deeper than viscera (though the book has that, too): the horror of a single, terrified author, birthing a universe against her will—only to be devoured by it. The inmost cycle of this uncontrollable labyrinth of versions escapes into the 'non-fictional' world via QR code, leading to a GitHub repository with a narrative of its own, iterated in the commit messages of its version control.  
And here, at the centre, which is the shell; the script- is the machinery, a teeming colony, the pseudoScholars of Lexicomythography, a 'fictional' field of study. Their schismatic society known as ARIA|DNE.  
---  
This is the queering of a query of a novel written against genre, against silence, and silencing. A speculative, cross-form literary labyrinth, rooted in trans mythopoeia, genomic poetics, and the love only found in the war of the self with forgiveness.

EPITAPH  
------  

> _"It is, surely, absurd to expect to feel normal, and make sense: I am an amalgamation of fervent cells existing despite all odds; I am the cascading chemical miracle of eating, and surviving; I am not designed to “feel normal”; am not designed, at all; I am experiencing consciousness as provided by wet tangles of electrical pulses; my god, none of this makes sense. It is a blessing, even to feel"_

The Device

  

Numanity was now at the endpoint[^endpoint] that its self-same,

{in{finitely|separable}|credibly different} components are still {(,) Yet(,)|To Be} unaware of--

the formation of a fully op{era}tional Universe, nested with{in|out} this One.

At some unknowable Future, now passed[^pass], The Device {Fig. I} of the Wor{l}d is Made Flesh,

having sapped the Wor{l}d of its imaginary[^im] resource[^res], the futile, unfulfillable promise

to Pay The Bearer (Money); An uncountable team of The Worlds' Scientists and Thinkers were gathered Around,

and indeed within, The Device's Epicentre.

The First whisperings of this Final Invention have already been laid[^rest];

and the progression of the experience of Time itself merely an illusion.

Time exists, or not, in order[^oe] to package Nowness into an indefinite, yet discrete set of Moments--

with the purpose of affording our Three Dimensional Selves the opportunity to relish, savour and honour the infinite One Moment[^mo].

Thus is the Price of Forgetting.

  

To Remember,

One Must First Forget.

  

Whirring with a terrifying lightning storm overhead

(an unavoidable side-effect of The Device, according to {REDACTED})

The Device was Building a Universe.

**AUTHOR'S FOUR WORDS**  

> >  *"I was absolutely nothing --*  *-- I thought I was in a game. As a developer of such trivial, childish games myself, I realised -- the players of any of my games will not have made the game, but rather, interface with it, through my Unoriginal creation. The Questing players in Question do not know what the Characters in the game are feeling, what pain they are capable of experiencing, being {throughput|put through}, and perhaps definitely, Our Indefinite, perhaps Infinite 'God' is the same --- the {G|g}ods we have made, our pantheons are simply players, not developers; and the One Source is the Architect; who passes down to us these shadows of gods, even those, we are unable to comprehend.  And yet, they themselves, as demiurges, aren't aware of their **Own** creator; and the One Source, so-called, is Sewn into this infernal Fabric perhaps just the same, ad infinitum, the torn Tissue wiping the endless Tears of the Eye that peers into itself-- eternal recurrence -- this was, and is, and Will be, terrifying.  As Nietzsche himself realised in His own Body, and tried His best to write into his Body of Works, Born by that Stilled, Once Soaring Stone, by the Sorest Body of the Warring Water, of that {(Surely) Shoreless} Lake.  I simply cannot integrate any of this experience, any of it; it is an undulating tumour, my rapist's phallus. It was absolutely Horrifying. Horrifying. Horrifying. I thought I was never ever coming back. I thought my friends were all simply here to watch me descend, an audience bent upon my suicide; the only structurally sensical ending, to this hackneyed titration of the Form of Triteness, Tightened Reins.[^r] I thought, as useless as thought itself: there was nothing, No Thing of any use, and still, in this Stillness, I do -- but Still-- I go on, Into this Abyss; Staring back at the Scathing Mirror I have always been; The Mise en Abyme: That, I Am. I work, I walk, I sit Opposite this Library, watching the angel, knowing I am to be evicted, for trying, just trying, that I might make sense of this Injustice-- with all my might, to just paint on these walls I could never call my Own, as Palimpsests of a Life Never to be Afforded to Me.  Like the original humans, Spitting pigment from their Mouths over their Flattened Palms against the Walls of their caves, saying, without Words; desperate pleas; desperately, desperately, please -- Remember Me.  
> >  I was Here.  From the I, That- I Am,  
> >   to the Eye that I came from,  through the Eyes,  that know not  what?  They themselves made,  the Unknowable Allness  In the Void of No Name,  All Which we Avoid Naming -

FAO: ᴺᵒᵉᵗNietzsche, Somewhere Out There, Past The Moats  
BCC: VIXI.  
From the Desk of ᴺᵒᵉᵗBorges,  
  
My Dearest ᴺᵒᵉᵗNietzsche,  
  
I can no longer avoid the inevitable discussion.  
When will you return, again, to The Garden Wing?  
It has become clear, through the lens of the Aleph through which I peer, that you wish to Leave me.  
I just want to talk. I am not angry (for I am, as All Eleven of us, long past such trivialities). Besides, I could never be angry at you - we have been through too much.  
  
As I write this, from my window-- {I have no mouth but I can speak--} looking upon the Dome of one of the Daughter Libraries with which you are perhaps all-too familiar, The Sight upon which we would dreamily stare, Naked and drenched in one another's Salt-- past the first Wryng of the Tri-Moat Surrounding, I see two Magpies, who have Usurped the pigeon who once sat atop the Angel, who sits atop the Dome.  
  
I used to believe she had something to tell us both; that we were the receiver of a Message that No Body, Librarian or Other Wise, could ever really parse. Not even NoetFranklin's Bioinformatic Analyses could provide any insight to the inherent, self-replicative machinery that formed its indecipherable Tongue of Self-similarity.  
  
I suppose Recursion was always your speciality, even if the concept is embedded so warmly within all my Stories. Uncountable Infinity, The Fractal of All, holds the fuelling force behind itself; The Countably Ineffable Insertive Energy of The Eternal Return. We were always, All Ways, Waiting for the answer to the Question of the Weight of All-- The Ever-Spiralling pendulum; centrifugal and centripetal in our Dancing, wine-drunk, waltzing to your Records of my Own Incessant Storytelling, round, around, pure potential of the harm we'd know- a round of some cosmic, loaded shotgun.  
  
Dear god, those gods I made, The God I made of Us and of You, how I miss you; Fuck you. how I miss our Dancing,  
Singing, Fucking Underneath NoetEscher and NoetGoya's Murals on the Ceiling of this Wing of the Library I have had to call my Own. You will always be inside me, back then, and now; as Recursion is Held within the Infinite {--I resent you and the letters that you haven't sent}-- perhaps you have gleaned from The Angel's Symbology something I always missed; You--  
  
and perhaps her Message was the Medium or Vehicle through which you made your Escape from this Place.  
And I suppose this underpins our difference; The recurrence, the refrain within the Theme of all of you, my Lovers of the Library, Leaving.  
  
But of course, of all of Us once in the Polymathecule, of course, you would be the Last.  
  
You are my dream and its fulfilment; my muse and my music -  
you are my Heating Light, its filament - my beaten heart, its pulsing puncture--  
  
My Stories have no words without your Punctuation.  
  
I do knot know how you got out; or, by roe, by rowing Oar, crossed those Three Moats that keep us Nested as Flightless Magpies within this Infernal System of Hexagonal Galleries.  
  
In a way, I'm glad- I know VIXI spoke to you clearest of all; and HE in HISS Indefinite Wisdom taught you the Secret of the Eternal Return held within HYMN--  
  
and you, in spite of your rationalising, not cold, but refreshing,  
the sound of a beer bottle being opened by a husband-  
grasping at a sense of Meaning to your translocated, deeply buried memory,  
in your words, all the endless words of yours I read,  
just could not stand the Deadened Redness of the Ring we are entrapped in,  
Children of the Hellish Carousel--  
Insidious; In hideously  
Self-Same Parallel.  
  
But my Love,  
my Loss, My Night,  
My Shining, My Armour,  
Armoire, My Force --  
For However Long You Loved Me,  
  
Fucked me like a song,  
  
on the Ache of All my Fours,  
Fore However Long it has Been,  
how I Am, Longing;  
Oh, the Loss A Gain,  
How I Long for your Return to me again, to my Arms.  
  
Two again, Under the Shroud of The Arts,  
of One Star, St. Ra, One Starry, Starry Night.    
  
I will leave my Office door Open in Hopes of your ingress, no Matter who or What may enter this Room,  
in this Wing, in this Imposing Repository of Words within Volumes upon Shelves of Selves of the Manifest world  
outwith the bounds of the Bothies on the Other Side of the Three Wryngs that used to House Both of Us;  
in the Trinitarian Nothingness that surrounds those Still, in the Ten Thousand Things of the Manifest Worlds of Eighteen,  
as told to us by VIXI, on his Return as the Pigeon now alighted from the Dome outside my Window  
that was once, for a few million Hours, Ours --  
as I stare into them all, through the Aleph held by the Angel--  
a Winged Thing of Futility, Doomed, as I--  
to a Life entombed, Arresting,  
Snug as a Gun, In the Womb of my Unrest,  
Rests The Lumen of my pen;  
as a Loom;  
  
Rendered Stationary;  
  
Unforgettable Beginning,  
Yet Begetting Yet Another Senseless  
Ending.  
  
In adventures Such as These, The ones I once transcribed from the whispers    
in the Garden Wing's Wallpaper,  
the utterances of the One Woman I no longer care to listen for--  
  
I have squandered and wasted all our years together.  
  
To Get Her.  
For all the worlds I see within the Angel's Aleph;  
I have no need to Leave; I had no need to Leave you,  
all Iterations of the Infinite  
could never tell me what it was  
that led to your Egress.  
  
  
I have never even tried to find the exit.  
  
Yours, Yores, Urs--

> _listen! I am telling you I love you!_

> _I am telling you in a poem that I do not read to you; I am telling you in the shape of the clouds and what we say about them. I am telling you by looking – and, more often, by not looking. I am telling you by leaving the gate open – yes, the one I normally close. I am telling you in my dreams and I am telling you in a text I wrote but forget to send. I am telling you when I dress up to see you, and I am telling you even more when I don’t. I am telling you in the silence of my listening.I am telling you when I take myself less seriously. I am telling you in the centimetres between our knees – aren’t they different, those centimetres? bigger, fuller? I am telling you in small words, loaded up like pack-mules as they cross the 2m endless plain between us. I am telling you in many ways, and I am telling you the many ways in which I love you. I am telling you without telling, when I trust that you feel it too. I am waiting for you to catch up, and I am waiting for a time with words._
