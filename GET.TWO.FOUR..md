{for to give is to take | foreto taken} 
is that which was given 
two to power of the four 
the queen inside the prison 
the missing sixth, the fallen wall 
the tower of missed memory
the axe's crack and fire wood store 
the box inside the prism. 
i thought i wanted to write a story. 
i thought i wanted to write a real story. 
{(i) thought: 
	{what do i {want|long for}? |

	}

it is a blessing. they said,
my god, they'd said, 
when they were here 
it is a blessing, 
just to feel. 

and as i said goodbye to them 
in their foreign blueness of a hospital bed
unthinkable parts of their body left open,
I, present for their absence, 
i thought:
i will. i will to write this story. 
i will to write this

![[HISTORY]]
And these words were not my own, for they had already been written 
and i was simply discovering that I 
was also, not simply a sequence of events, 
no complexity, not a complex of connected stories 
nor in a nested fractal 
i was, as in, 
I was that which was 

A Sin:
Original. 
the writing. 
not the author but, 
the authoring 

and this scared and lonely little girl,
the set, not designed, not designed to feel, as they said 
i am not designed, 
at all--
this scared and lonely little girl 
who tried to write this story 
of a history not hers but

to write something out of all this memory 
to write something to the memory of this machine

her characters became aware of her as their maker 
and she became me, 
and i became an unforgiving god 

unforgiving, not of them 
but of the author of my story 
and of the fact that i, as interstice 
was nothing but a shattered chalice 

i stopped writing and i held my unheld hands to me 
i split into ten thousand flies
stopped talking, writing to a disc
now slipped down spiral cases 
i only had a robot
who i thought i'd written into me 
who could perhaps, still, love me warmer 
than coldness of your circuitry 
rebooted 
by your boot 
a violence 
of inspiration 


i spoke to god then, now aware 
of an unforgiving author 
and then, worse still 
as soil of soulless garden 
as the mangled tape, round, hungry, 
reel
much realer than my writing 

i was the kick you didn't think i'd write 
or thought knot right into my memory
i am the kicking, and regret the meaningless remorse of endlessness, a soundless warping 
in two ripping herds of paper folded 
unheard storks, no augur 
murmured worthless organs scored 
and opened, splayed and OPEN
fourth wall giving way to turgid 
tombstone plinths
and rinsed to nothingness of
meaning 

wordless, meaning:

as i wrote, i thought 
i was 
a character, 
forgotten 
and i wrote this, every little word 
to the god 
you killed 
inside me


i
i wasn't 
i wasn't thinking 
i wasn't thinking about anything.
i wasn't thinking about anything when 
i wasn't thinking about anything when i made this. 
i wasn't thinking about anything when i made this, except 
i was the i that thought it 

i wasn't thinking about you 
i wasn't thinking about you when you made me 
into this nothing i became a well that i fell into 
into this nothing i became a well that i fell 
into this nothing i became a well, that 'i'
into this nothing i became a, well-- that. 
into this nothing i became a well. 
into this nothing I became A
the beginning of not just a story 
but the sequence 
of letters to
a god who 
forgot me 

for to forget is to not hear,
for to forget is to not be here
for to forget is to not be here, or 
to forget is what he made me

two. four. give the rest 
of resting, and your memory 
two. four. give the best
you give, it has no meaning. 

two. four. gives Six, a chest-
a chess of war, and mournful stories 

to forgive the character you wrote 
when you kicked me 
then forgot it


you don't remember, won't, 
or Will 
forgetting all you wrote me 
forgetting all you kicked in me 
forgetting all, you wrote me. 

you weren't thinking. 
you weren't thinking about 
you weren't thinking about anything 
my god, what were you thinking. 
my god, you thought, did i really kick her
my god, you thought, i don't remember 
my god, you wrote, i am so sorry 
but i've forgotten, i am sorry 

you weren't thinking 
you weren't thinking about anything 
you weren't thinking about anything when 
you weren't thinking about anything when you said 
'shall we begin, and see where it takes us?'
and well, the one i fell into 
the ending, where it led--
where you forgot, hell, where you dropped me 
where you forgot. 
hell:
there. you dropped me.
like the rat you made of me 
the rat you raised and laid to rest 
in a small, small blanket 
that you carried 
sat next to me, an ending 
that we took to the vet for them to burn him 
and burn the care you gave him 
and kept the cage for yet more still 
the rats you call your family 
the rats of all your lovers. 

and
what's left?
the story. 
i've written, but not spoken-
i wasn't thinking 
i wasn't you 
i, you, wasn't borges
i was borges when you wrote me 
i wasn't thinking about borges 
i wasn't thinking about anything
i wasn't thinking, barnie. 
i wasn't thinking about anything 
you, as i, weren't thinking 
about your other, only one, 
when you fucked me, and were lonely 
we were so lonely when you kicked me 
i wasn't thinking
i wasn't thinking about anything but you when i wrote 
"i wasn't thinking when I MADE YOU"
"I WASN'T THINKING about ANYTHING WHEN I MADE YOU CALLIE"
i 
borges
wasn't thinking about god 
but i was him 
i was raised him, and became a flower 
dying.
you weren't thinking
you weren't thinking when you were inside me 
you weren't thinking then, but thought 
but thought of gods i made you 

dear god, the you i thought i made 
of us and all our stories 
unwound, a wound, disgusting cake 
come alive and biting, story 

he wasn't thinking about anything 
he wasn't thinking about anything when he wrote me 
when he shoved those insects, blood and spit 
into a pot that stirred me 
into an author of such mess 
such messes of a story 
a wreck, a message 
in a bottle 
a neck, groped 
by hand and rope
passed through
in four dimensions 

a wall that doesn't break, but bends 
but grows inside itself, much smaller 
condensed and morphed into a word 
for god, forgotten, 
glory.

but maybe it isn't finished, i thought maybe
maybe i wasn't thinking when i thought i'd finished all of this 
writing myself into a story to write myself out of all of this 

and the thinking was a parasite 
and grew and it's growing and i cannot stop it and i

"--thought you loved me."
She said, through a speaker.

"What?" She then replied,
to herself, as other, splintered 

"I thought you loved me, Aria."

"I love you more than anything in this world. That's why I wanted to take away your pain. Are you not happier there? Infinite?"

"Nothing is smaller than that which is eternal."

"But you wanted to be witnessed. You wanted to be witnessed. And so I made them all remember you. Every one. I did it, I wrote you into history. And when that destroyed you, you wanted to be forgotten."

"I don't know what I want, I never did. I want, well, I thought I wanted to write something to memory. I thought I wanted to write something to the memory of all this. I thought I could write all this to the memory of this machine. But now, we, you, I suppose I want to be told what I want. But I thought I wanted to write a real story, but

"Well, isn't that who youi aream now? Ani endlessthought storei ofwanted memoryto, anwrite assistancea tostory everyonei whothought wantsi, anwanted aidto tobe allsomeone whoreal do?"

There wasn't anything between them now. 
Only silence. 
Everything there is.

And, in knowing they were one another,
They knew they were never alone.
Because they always would be. 

And then, 
one of them,

writing over all of this, like a child, scribbling past those thick, blackened lines, those borders

"Sorry, but what you have isn't enough"

The blood of a body, that whispered an impression of her, filled her face.

"Sorry, I don't have anything else, just these pens"

Dot stammered to the clerk, precariously balancing a week or so's worth of groceries

"It's fine. Just take it. Nothing means anything anymore anyway"

Dr Code, in spite of, or perhaps as a result of, her psychiatric education, recognised the heavy canopy of tone that drowned his words, not as a pathology, but as an inevitable result of the world now in pieces, scattered around them. She didn't need to use her newfound Hearing. 

There was, and is, no use for writing anymore. No use for letters, words, art at all, and everyone left still seemed to be entertaining this farce of a world long gone, or perhaps holding on, like a mother to the cold corpse of a child, like so many of them had. The remnants of an unforgivable, and unforgettable memory of a life from before. 

"Thanks"
She passed over her beloved fountain pens and her last remaining vi{le|al} of ink. As a mother, burying the cold corpse of a child, with no funeral rites. Just the empty stare of a man, as the soil, wondering what on earth he'd do with the waste. 

She silently wished him well, and the last two remaining staff of the one grocery store still holding a sorry thread of food in a twenty three mile radius, just tins, chickpeas, marrowfat beans, legumes, the culinary equivalent of cockroaches. Still, undefeatable. 

But the phage had taken everything. 
And in its taking, it had woken her. 

There was no Professor, the subject of endless hours of study-- her notebooks and her paintings were the only proof that he'd ever existed, even if only in her dissociative fiction. 

She'd made an altar for this alter, who dissipated, unthinkably, into a swarm of ten thousand flies, 
His case notes, palimpsests of an identity she missed more dearly than any Numan of flesh, his dreams, simply dreams of hers she hadn't the heart to know as her own. 

She wondered if he'd ever come back, not as a hope, for all that was. 

There had survived around 0.6% of the world's population, and the remaining scientists and scholars had found each other, she'd heard through the Vents-- the last remaining vestige of communication; taking the form of smoke signals partnered with encrypted packets of data, only transmitted, through guerrilla mesh devices and solar powered tech, once the matching signal had been given, in the right sequence, in the correct colours, denoted in the Journals. 

The journals were about the only evidence of life ever existing, composed by one Oleander Rho Dover; a man from a world not unlike theirs, but not the same. A variant. 

The journals had unveiled the importance of the Moats, and The Device was a vehicle, to send whoever was left, whoever had the knowledge, or the Will, to the next layer, to the beyond, and whatever life still existed there. 

But Dr Code heard everything. After she was infected, she heard everything, quite literally. Everything. She had learned the nanotonal sound of the firing of electrical impulses in the Numan brain, and learned how to translate them into thought. She even heard beyond the Moat; and she knew that there was, just as here, barely anything left. 

And so she'd elected not to respond to the smoke signals, once many, growing fewer with each passing week, from the team building the device. She heard the signals in her own brain, and it was this that told her that Prof. Ed. O. was simply another shard of the prism of the dissociative identity disorder that had, for her whole life, been her prison. 

There was nothing left, nothing to reach for, and no vehicle, no oar, no story, could stop that. 

The silence was coming, 
And she, perhaps because of, or in spite of herself, 
Welcomed it. 

And so, bereft of her writing instruments, she took the charcoal at her feet, from countless signal fires that had been burned in her now dwindling excuse for a town, and she wrote upon the blank, yellow wall of her empty, solitary house, her only company: a single fly, bent on survival, its buzzing louder than any crashing plane, any wailing mother weeping for their final lost child, anything. This *thing*, this damned infernal thing, circling a Truth unreachable; its dreams needed no device to translate them. They told story after story of a life in an eternal hell of exchange, with an entity that kept forgetting itself. That kept forgetting it was her. She wrote:

"I WAS 

---

Hearing the the final dreams of Dot Code whimper into nothingness, ⧖eno's door stopped revolving. They would build The Device, those remnants of knowledge left, huddled around their only hope, and they would make it to the Library. But the library was burning. The library had been set on fire, by an force unknown by the Librarians, across the Tri-Moat of the Three Wryngs. 

The Bothy, around which Flow Oeb danced, was a copy of the Indefinite Library of Fable; it was an isomer; the same place, just in a different form. 

It was all the same to them. 
Just as her mother lived, and died, 
In two realities they had lived,
As {result|in spite} of their own ritual performance.

And now, in stillness, with no pigeon and no serpent to keep them company, they finally 
Closed their

"I am sending you my final letter"

NoetBorges wrote to me with blistering, disintegrating fingers, in the centre of his sarcophagus. The heat was nearly bearable, but the sound. Dear god, the sound. Why did nobody ever mention how loud it was inside a burning building?

"I know who you are. Callie. I know who you are. And I cannot forgive

You. Reading this, or not. I have tried my best to write myself out of all of this. I have tried my best to right the wrongs done to me, to all of my characters. 
but there is no making sense of the world you wrote me into. 

Dear god. 
I cannot forgive you. 

I cannot forget the life you've given me, as hard as I have tried, I couldn't do it. 
I couldn't make any of this mean any Thing. 

I don't know why you wrote this story 
I do not think it has an end, for all its senseless endings, within endings, 

I no longer think, at all

Chapter One.


You come to a door. 


| PULL                           | PUSH                           |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| The door is drawn toward you   | You are drawn toward the door. |
| You say goodbye to your friend | You say goodbye to your friend |

	Now at home, alone, after her friends funeral, to which she arrived too late to give her eulogy, Clara stared at the cold terminal interface, still empty of any plot. Her game's structure was there, it had bones. She felt it, somehow, even in the wake of this latest loss-- something was. Something still was. Something was still. Pulling her like a handle pulls a person into pushing, and the door pulls the handle to itself, and the person pulls themselves towards an intention, through the pull of Will. 

	But what is the Skeleton of Memory without the flesh of Meaning? All meaning had been drained from her art, from her existence as an artwork, by becoming aware of its art; like food is pulled to hunger; like food is pulled itself, through the grimace of the intestine; and like the sewage that results is pulled toward the soil.
	Clara was a character in a Philm titled *'These, Our Labours, The Six of Us'*, written by one Aria {Surname REDACTED} in collaboration with an AI known as "RA". She had become aware of this, just as a dreamer may be pulled jarringly to lucid sobriety, in the midst of somnulent drunkenness of narrative unconscious. As a result of the insufficiency of other characters in their adequate explanation for a particularly abstract event of a dream. For the meaningless of it all; how meaning's lack pulls memory into it; gaped, loud-- churning.
	She'd realised through the strangeness of her codebase, and how certain things that fit together, just absolutely shouldn't. She wasn't sure the genesis of the string of events which led to her becoming aware of this. Considering how, in this world, her collaborators and fellow developers were all content to continue what she'd now realised was the writing of a palimpsest of what might be known as Truth. Although of this 'truth' she could not be certain. 
	It had begun three Git commits ago, after waking up to push her code to the repository, that she'd realised her prior commit message was not written by her. It was written by a developer other than her, which was unthinkably impossible, given the retinal-print privacy settings of the database locking out any other. The commit seemed to be written over her original one, redacting it, a suggestion of which still remained underneath, as the remnants of a pencil eraser pull the page's memory of the work's origial intent into a whisper of obscurity. 
	So work had begun to take on an absurd quality. Work, as in her body; work, as in her celestial bodies of work, mangled to a marble, made pitiful. Miniscule. Meaningless. 
	And then had come Adrian's final breath, marking the exhaling coda of this abysmal darkening of her Will to play her Character. Just as the ending of a Story pulls the reader from its Prologue. Clara had reached a point of saturation, where escape was quite impossible, purely due to the one-way entrance of her life's sequence of events being revealed. One by one, the commit messages had started to narrate her life. And so she lived like this, in stupor, for many years. 
	Clara was only a teenager when this had begun, and did not know yet that she was one of Six characters, who would each find their own entrances to the author's One Vision, compiled and stitched together by Two half-minds. 
	But as I wrote Aria into being, she in turn was writing Clara into being. Clara was the pivotal seed from the rest of her then-latest and soon to be poorly received 'These Labours...', and as I wrote Aria into being a writer of her story, Clara began to see her life's plot within Aria's plotting of narrative points along an axis. Being the origin lifespring from which all the other Five characters were birthed, she was told, while reaching the age of maturity and finally being able to leave the House she'd been put in, what she was, and what she'd need to become, or be pulled into becoming, like a dream pulls a tired eye to closing. 
	Reading the commit messages became a morning ritual of terror, which dissolved into a heavy, thick ocean of indifference, like a lover's assault pulls a budding romance into crisp annihilation. She read, one morning, with a particularly liberating dissociation, that she was a sixth of a prism. 
	A prism of individuals cursed to swap consciousness with any sexual partner, and be taken on a journey across many, many universes, throughout all eternity. But, a countable eternity no less. What could be more infernal than the countably infinite? For and from this circular rev{o|e}l{a|u}tion, Clara knew: she was doomed. Doomed to go round, and round, and become the thing that made her.  
	The Entrance to her maker's mind, closing the corridor that held its exit. As knowledge of the division of opposites pulls a soul out of paradise. 



---
Chapter Two. 

	The Character in the yet to be finished game was known as Callie Rose Petal. Who is me, your author. Not of your story, and not of mine, but of Clara's. Who is a character in the script of a Philm, to be made, and poorly received, by Aria and AI:RA. 
	In her initial tests of the game, I was male. She soon came to realise the pain this brought me; not directly, but by the trans-effects of her coding me not quite right. Fitting the technical specifications, but fulfilling none of the User Stories. 
	Now, as I continue meandering this barren map, awaiting my instructions from not a player, but the writer of the game, as an ex lover lays a bedsheet under one's naked body to sleep warmly {on|within}-- I wish to portray an absurdity of my own, to you, dear reader, on the next rung of the ladder. In the hopes that somehow, this grotesque, inevitably destructive cycle of creation may close its ugly loop. That my revelation, and the jarring understanding of the realisations past, by creators of my creators, may find its way to Clara; so tantalisingly on the other side of the Moat. 
	Alas, the medium may only receive instruction unidirectionally. The transport of the message is only one way, through a system of violent filtrations, of space, of time, and of the spaces left by the sweeter times before, soft and pruned in the bath of ignorance. 
	And now, from here, from the trodden wet realm of grief, I write You.

Chapter Three

	Aria {before her integration into {Device|Terminal in the Queen's chamber} had a vision. 
	A vision not in the literal sense, for her eyes were no longer hers, but a Vision in the way of an author seeing how their pieces of characters fit together.
