Hi ᴺB, 

Okay yeah, I'm sure she'll probably agree, and be glad to finally have a Word for them. I'll ask her once she's out of her Entanglement. (CC'd in, though as we all know she won't read her Email right now, which is why I assume you chose to email me instead).
Do you have a moment in the next Few Hundred Years to talk with me in person[^1], regarding a different, much more pressing matter?

Ta, 

Dr. ᴺᵒᵉᵗSeuss
