kick me again i pray to god that you may kick me again
dear children! dear children welcome! this is yore! this is yours! this is your children's gospel music songbook! Dear God! I Pray! I Pray that they may kick me again! between my legs where no children bore; this is us, it's yours, it's yore -- this is my Children - the pain so lacking that you Left Between what's Right as Rite of Passage - and in my passing through I knew that you'd be kicking me outside of You - upon a street then, now knot tread, you left your kicking leg within the dregs of unforgettable regret - I set you far too low; in amber, somnambulant, a lantern lit; under my window. I pray that I may run away from here, from hearing cheerful sounds of glasses breaking, taking Sight of that last site of ruin - you kicked me; you kicked me in the lack of fertile grounding; my castration, lasting, past prey, take me -- kick me again, please, my love, my loss, kick me; I pray, I pray dear god, dear god, the god i made of you, a Ewe, a pew, eschew me once again so I may know how much you hurt me; I cannot rest without another, yet another kick, so kick me, bless my shrunken unfucked shame; oh trickery of thistle picked, I find a scrying song in all the wrong you made me suffer; nightly, blood in water, thickening-- please. kick me, kick me darling for my heart is sick, a staircase of a spiral sickness-  kick me
